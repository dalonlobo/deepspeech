hello and welcome to get it rolling today you will learn about print functions variables basic __arrimatic__arithmetic operations and how to accept and input let's get started you can use any editor of your choice i am using __five__py __five cham__pycharm so you can open your __kaman from then__command prompt__ also type __five na__python to open an interpreter so print function is used to print to the console for example print __he__hi press enter and you can see that it is printing high similarly you can print multiple values like high and also how are you so basically this prints high space separated how are you now lets say you want to print the same thing with a separator and also you can end it with and equal to and you can __paas__pass a parameter like let's say ending back slash |n| enter you can see its adding this __operator__separator how are you and in this ending that next we will check about some basic asthematic operations like for example what is one plus two __doubt to the stream__the output is three__ you can do the same thing with minus and the operative__operator for multplucation__multiplication is star and the operator for __harvard s__power is__ two stars so two to the power to sequel to four and let's say you want to divide i will take a different number because i want to show a trick here so five divided by two is two point five but if you want to do a floor division so five divide by two so it gives you the question now let's say he want remainder you can put this module is operator so five divide by two remainder is one next we will look into variables variables are nothing but names given to the memory location for example let's consider a very able my bar is equal to i m going to store some integer five thousand into it now any time i want to use this variable i just have to write the name of variables for example i want to add three thousand to it so i can use the very able five thousand plus three thousand physical to eight thousand so that is about variable you can store pretty much any object in the variable now the last three things for today is how to accept and input from the console so it is a trait forward statement like for example i am going to use the same very able my back is equal to you can type in put it is a function and you can paas a parameter like please enter something right i will give my name now if i run this my back you can see that the same name what is enterd stored in that location let me change it the stand i am going to enter some digits and and you can see that my war there are some digits i have written this fine which is all the programs or functions that we are learning today and you can find this in get i will include the link in the description let me just run this file so you can see that print statement and all the other statements and also how to accept and input so that's as good by daal so thank you for watching please like subscribe and share
