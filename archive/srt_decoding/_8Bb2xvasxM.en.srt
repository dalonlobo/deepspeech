1
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:10,439
Intoxication is the nature of the moon

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,000
May 10th is a special pournami are a special full moon day because it's called Buddha Pournami

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,169
this is the day Gautama the buddha got enlightened

4
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:25,529
you notice

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:33,149
This year it's on 10th of may this full moon day is the day gautama the buddha got enlightened

6
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,950
There are many aspects to his life

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,500
The most important aspect is that he is a Bhu-dda

8
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,350
That's not his name

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,529
His name is Gautama Siddhartha, but he is a Buddha

10
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,399
Buddha means he transcended his intellect

11
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,370
Bhu means Buddhi

12
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,329
Dha means Datha

13
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:06,329
Buddhi means the intellect datha means one who is above one who is above his intellect is a buddha

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,799
One who is in his intellect is a non-stop suffering human being

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,009
Something happens they suffer nothing happens they suffer whichever way

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,529
that is if you're below the mind we call them Buddhu

17
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,380


18
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,959
If you are above the mind you are a buddha if you're below the mind you are Buddhu if you are in the mind

19
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,540
are nonstop suffering

20
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,770
So, how did you become this?

21
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:49,950
He tried many things in his life. He was a prince of a small princely state

22
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,610
because

23
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,259
some

24
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:02,309
yogi predicted that this will either become a great emperor or

25
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,950
become a great sage

26
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:08,519
when you made this prediction the father got

27
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,940
little

28
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,110
excited. he did not want him to become a great sage. He wanted to become a great emperor

29
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,559
So he decided he will not expose him to because he thought by

30
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,390
Being exposed to some suffering or misery he may turn into usage

31
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,229
So he kept him in utter pleasure... the best of food, best of clothes, best of pleasures, everything

32
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,579
When he was a 19 years of age he got him married to a very pretty young woman

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,559
kept him in a palace secluded from the rest of the society

34
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,059
Where he lives in pleasure never exposed to any kind of suffering.

35
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:01,790
One day he thought he will just take a drive through the town he asked his charioter to take him across

36
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,820
So he was going and then he saw a man who was old.

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Was going like this

38
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,580
So he had never seen old man in his life his father had protected him from all this

39
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,240
See what has happened to him, so the charioter said that's just an old man

40
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,260
How does it happen he asked?

41
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,590
Said everybody gets old some day

42
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,730
He looked at himself use a nice youth

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,350
What me also?

44
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,469
Said yes, everybody everybody gets old

45
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,290
they live long enough they get old

46
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,809
You this was a realization for him. I will become like this

47
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,470
Then he saw a man lying on the street was ill with something

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,339
Not able to get up in great suffering. He said stop. What is this guy? What's he doing?

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,089
He said oh, he's sick unfortunately

50
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,190
What does that mean?

51
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,050
He said my body sometimes it gets sick

52
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:18,230
It can happen to anybody it can happen to just anybody me a prince

53
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,229
Can happen to me it can happen to anybody?

54
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,740
And he's how I can become like this

55
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,809
Then they were going further. He was completely disturbed by this then he saw a funeral they were carrying a

56
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,590
Dead body of A man

57
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,159
What happened to that guy? Oh he just died?

58
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,780
What does that mean? that happens to everybody without exception?

59
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:59,069
Then he said what am I doing just eating pleasures nonsense? What am I doing with myself and

60
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,719
He struggled he went into turmoil within himself

61
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,169
This suddenly being a prince and his pleasures and all this palace

62
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:14,279
Suddenly broke apart for him and he started looking

63
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:20,908
What is the point of all this this is going to get old this may get sick for sure this will be dead?

64
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,719
What am I investing my entire life in this?

65
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,849
But by then he had an infant boy

66
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,210
he looked at his wife and

67
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,590
his child

68
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,180
this

69
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:44,130
Loving wife and this lovely little baby. He could not leave he struggled and struggled and struggled

70
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:48,749
By then a little or one and a quarter years passed

71
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:52,139
when the boy was one and a half years of age

72
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,818
He could not hold it anymore in the middle of the night like a thief

73
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,848
Without telling anybody he slipped out of the palace and left for good

74
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,209
He went in search. I want to know the truth about this life

75
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,930
He went from school to school

76
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,060
These are times when different schools were established in India

77
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:21,179
At one point there were over

78
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:25,679
1,800 schools, I'm saying not just institutions

79
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,620
1800 different ways of doing things

80
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:32,819
[1800] different varieties [of] Yoga

81
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:36,539
Not the kind that you're seeing in

82
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,140
Somebody doing like this somebody doing like this really intricate

83
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,910
Expressions, it is like how the medical science is becoming today

84
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,350
25 years ago you wanted a medical check-up. All you needed was your family doctor

85
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,900
today

86
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,590
But every part of your body there [is] a doctor I

87
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,650
Was [a] Few years ago. I had

88
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,440
You know I had a knee injury. I was playing soccer, and I broke something in the knee and

89
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,739
I was all packed up, and I was speaking

90
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,410
That's how I got into golf

91
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Because of this knee injury

92
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:22,919
Somebody told me gifted me of golf kit and said Sadhguru, you're too old for any other game. You just play golf

93
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,609
So I was sitting [there] in Atlanta talking speaking at a place

94
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,779
Then I was in pain, I couldn't even move

95
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,370
so

96
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,870
After the when this is over. I mean when I was speaking one person raised his hand I thought he wants a question

97
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,919
But then he said Sadhguru, I would like to examine your knee after

98
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,529
The zoa, I [am] a knee doctor. I

99
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,109
Said come on. You are not to panic [so] [no] no I am a new doctor

100
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,780
Then I said right or left

101
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,900
Which one are you?

102
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,980
so

103
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,030
specialization

104
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:12,050
Specialization is going a time will come probably in 50 years time if you want a medical check-up

105
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,180
You need 100 doctors to check you by the time you get these 100 appointments

106
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,910
Maybe you need an undertaker

107
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,920
Then it will become ridiculous. Okay, you went to three doctors. All right you and do

108
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,890
Five doctors all right if it becomes fifty [hundred] doctors for a medical check-up

109
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,290
It's become ridiculous. Isn't it this happened to yogic system

110
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,019
People started specializing and specializing in variety of small things

111
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,649
Each specialization has a whole thing by [itself]

112
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:59,749
Someone just came and told me [they're] a dentist okay. [I'm] not speaking in another thing for example dentistry just 32 teeth

113
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,640
Right they study for nine Years

114
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,060
[Thirty-Two] teeth

115
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,749
Nine years of study still they don't know everything about it. That's the nature of creation

116
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,589
If you start studying one tooth at a time, you will see each one of them has something specific about it

117
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,150
You somebody can spend a lifetime of study just learning about one tooth

118
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
Just see if you had 32 dentists to look at your mouth

119
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,000
Disaster you are isn't it so a specialization?

120
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,629
Specialization happens when it crosses a certain point it will become ridiculous this happened to yoga it

121
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,810
crossed that point where

122
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,459
[1800] schools different specializations of Yoga happened

123
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:58,430
So that is when patanjali came and kind of assimilated everything into yoga Sutras to minimize this expanse

124
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,650
That was growing endlessly

125
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,489
so when Gothama came it was post patanjali, but

126
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,929
Still there were many things so he went from school to school

127
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,830
He pursued eight different forms of Samadhi

128
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,890
We talk about [semantics], okay?

129
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,649
He pursued eight different forms of Samadhi

130
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:32,050
He saw all of them were wonderful experiences, but still it did not liberate him

131
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,180
so in this condition

132
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,370
He was walking as a samana. There's a certain system of

133
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,409
practice called Samanas their fundamental practices this

134
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,930
They will never ask for food

135
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,449
You should not go in pursuit of food

136
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,770
because

137
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,770
they want to beat the

138
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
fundamental Instinct of survival

139
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:04,930
No matter what you're always going in pursuit of food, please understand this you may complicate it in so many ways, but fundamentally

140
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,600
You're talking so much the word economy means you're just thinking about survival all the time isn't it

141
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,529
[sir], I will glorify it, but till it is survival

142
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:21,129
So one fundamental Sadhana for them is you never pursue your instinct of survival

143
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,170
You simply keep going so samanas used to just walk

144
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,780
never asking for food

145
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:37,480
but the culture was sensitive if they saw a spiritual person walking people will cook at home and run behind him and

146
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,940
serve him wherever he is

147
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,540
Because they know he will not ask for food

148
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,380
Today if you become a samana you will walk yourself to death

149
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:57,710
Those days people were sensitive to his sadhana and responded so there were thousands of samanas walking the country

150
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,319
so Gotham on became a samana and

151
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,119
Even if you are not asking for food, you will walk near a town

152
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
so the food will come

153
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,860
but Gothama took it too seriously and

154
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,430
Just walked he became all bones

155
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,140
just

156
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,429
bones and a bag of skin like that he became

157
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:30,410
Then he came to a place where there was a river called Niranjana unfortunately that river is gone now

158
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,530
no, more river

159
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,450
just

160
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,970
About 18 to 20 inches of water may be moving little rapidly

161
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,999
He stepped into it halfway down into the river. He did not have the energy to cross

162
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,880
There was a tree branch a dead branch he just held onto it

163
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,509
He doesn't have the strength to take the next step

164
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,509
But he's not the kind of man to let go he held on we don't know for how long

165
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,009
People say for a very long time maybe it was two minutes

166
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,850
When you're feeling, so weak those two minutes might have looked like

167
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
many years

168
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Then as he hung on

169
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,439
He just realized what is it that? I'm striving for

170
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:30,739
What is it I'm wondering the entire country growing from school to school learning this learning that what is it that? I'm looking for

171
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,840
Then he realized

172
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
This is really nothing

173
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,869
This life is wrong. All I have to do is

174
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,280
Just take away the barriers which are not allowing me to experience this

175
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,529
When he realized that everything is within him. There's nowhere to search

176
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,970
Suddenly he had the energy to take the next step in the next step across the river came and sat down under that

177
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,670
Now very famous bodhi tree

178
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,160
Which has become more then the buddha himself?

179
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
A

180
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,829
part of the tree a remnant Or a progeny of the tree still exists in both Gaya

181
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,220
and

182
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,200
He sat under the tree. It was this full moon night. Which is coming now

183
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
on 10th of May

184
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,600
He sat there, and he sat there with this determination either

185
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,979
I must see the ultimate nature of my existence now

186
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,190
Or I will sit here and die I will not open my eyes till I know this

187
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:49,860
Once he made that resolve because the only problem is there is no resolve every two minutes your intentions are changing

188
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,510
If you are totally on to know, what is within you how long should it take?

189
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,029
It should happen in a moment, isn't [it]?

190
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,090
Because there is no distance to travel

191
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:13,709
Time is a quantity which [is] necessary only when there is a distance to travel isn't it?

192
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,620
If there is no distance to travel if I ask you, how long does it take for you [to] sit [here]?

193
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
You're already sitting

194
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,049
It's already there. It doesn't take any time

195
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:33,149
So you're already alive and on it doesn't take any time for realization because you don't have to do anything particularly?

196
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,670
when he saw this he was fully enlightened and the moon was shining and

197
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,379
He had not eaten for many months on end properly used actually for years. He was a samana and

198
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,820
People around him he had gathered about five disciples. I think

199
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,200
These guys thought he's real because he doesn't eat his really rigid

200
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,310
and

201
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:03,419
They saw he's in some state exuberant state and they could see the light on his face

202
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,399
Then they were waiting for him to open his eyes and give the teaching

203
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,620
He opened his eyes look them smiled and said cook something let's eat

204
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,930
They have a totally disappointed they thought he has lost it

205
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,979
They walked with him for four to eight years

206
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,009
when he had nothing, but torture

207
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,860
When he got enlightened they left him

208
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,680
because

209
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,279
They wanted to hear something severe

210
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,309
He said cook something let's eat

211
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
We've been wasting our time

212
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,690
There are many beautiful episodes in his life

213
00:16:54,650 --> 00:17:02,620
When he one day walked upon the Riverbank after he has become a good and went and sat down under a tree

214
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,710
Tree not because tree is the best place to sit under you know ants can get you

215
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,330
Because that was the only real estate of those times there are no buildings and buildings and buildings everywhere

216
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,680
So tree was a good place to a pleasant place to sit under rather than sitting in harsh sun. You sit under a tree

217
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,270


218
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,330
An astrologer who is of great

219
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,120
proficiency in history

220
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,989
Saw the footprint on the Riverbank he had come to

221
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:46,389
In the in India people of any this thing means bad means always river those rivers are going away. I will tell you later

222
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,930
bath means always river

223
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,369
So he came for a bath that they were then he saw the footprint

224
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,580
There is a whole science

225
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,850
or

226
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,080
rather

227
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,940
observations

228
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,479
Through which by looking at the way [one's] feet is somebody predicts exactly what he will do

229
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:17,229
So he saw the footprint and then he saw that this is the footprint of an emperor somebody who should rule the world

230
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,710
Then he wondered why would such a person be in this remote place near the jungle

231
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Then he followed the footprint

232
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Thinking he will meet an emperor

233
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,370
Then he saw this monk

234
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,490
Gothama sitting under a tree

235
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,369
Then he looked at this this he thought either my astrology has gone all wrong

236
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,109
or I am being fooled or and in some kind of a hallucination

237
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,940
What's happening here then he went to Gotham and asked who are you?

238
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:59,279
Gautama was in this kind of just Jeet kind of state

239
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,509
He said and no crime. [I] am just a nobody

240
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,599
But you have the feet of an emperor you should conquer the world

241
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Gautama said that I will

242
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:26,249
But not by conquest see there are two ways you can have the world either by conquest or by inclusion

243
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,020
yes, I

244
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:35,129
can make you yours either by capturing you chaining you and making you do what I want or

245
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,369
By including you as a part of myself. Yes

246
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,769
Both ways something or somebody becomes yours isn't it

247
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:51,180
But if you go by conquest, it will be a pain in your neck always

248
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,760
if you include

249
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,969
This will become a great enhancement of life

250
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:04,049
He said I am the emperor of the world, but then he said you're a monk you own  nothing.

251
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,830
I own nothing and I am a nobody that is why?

252
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Everything is mine

253
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,910
Even mathematicians are trying to teach you the zero on the infinite or one and the same

254
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,119
So you becoming of a no thing?

255
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
does not mean

256
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,780
You are of no use

257
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,379
You are [a] no thing means you have  become

258
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:40,319
All inclusive, isn't it you're something means you can only be that

259
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:49,649
You're nothing you can be any way you want this is how this life is made if your ability to respond is not curtailed

260
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,909
You can be anything you wish at any given moment, isn't it?

261
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:01,559
So Gothama said I am  anyway the emperor of the world if that's the word you like, but I'm actually a nobody

262
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Because everything is anyway mine

263
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:11,639
If you see, I'm responsible for everything everything is yours isn't it how does somebody become yours

264
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,169
Because you want them or you take responsibility for that?

265
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:23,608
because you take [responsibility] [for] them they become yours not otherwise, isn't it

266
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,449
If you own them forcefully they will never be yours

267
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:36,358
Yes, or no if you forcefully own 
 somebody will they ever be yours they'll never ever be yours

268
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,559
So this astrologer sat down

269
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:48,988
They said you're a monk you have nothing on top of it. You say you're just it. I'm sorry

270
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:53,519
I'm top of it you say I'm a nobody and

271
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:57,149
Everything is yours. What is this?

272
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:05,128
Gothama said you come I have a way for you

273
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,350
You are busy making predictions of Life

274
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,429
I have a plan

275
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,950
Why do you make predictions of life?

276
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:23,279
[you're] incapable of making a plan and executing a plan that is why you fall back any predictions isn't it?

277
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:30,929
if you are capable of making a plan and executing the plan would you fall back on predictions?

278
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:34,109
no

279
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:40,648
So gautama said you were busy making predictions. I'm here. I have a plan

280
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:44,669
Come become a part of my plan

281
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,790
We'll make something else happen

282
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,719
You must become a part of this plan we can make something wonderful happen

283
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
this same world

284
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,250
This same World can be turned into paradise

285
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,050
If all its all of us, go buy a paradise plan isn't it?

286
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,630
Yes, or no

287
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,790
The question is only

288
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,269
do that because between a

289
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:23,369
Possibility, and the reality there is a distance or do we have the courage and the commitment to walk the distance. That's all it is

290
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Yes

291
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
you
