V the most beautiful thing about time is
p53
aVif you do something it passes by
p54
aVif you do nothing it passes by
p55
aVif you are joyful it passes by
p56
aVif you are miserable it passes by
p57
aVits absolutely just no matter who you are
p58
aVhow you are
p59
aVfor everyboy it passes at the same speed
p60
aVonly thing is our experience of the time could be different
p61
aVdepending upon how intensely we live
p62
aVor how slack we are
p63
aVif youre very slack with life
p64
aVit looks like time is passing by very slowly
p65
aVif youre very intense
p66
aVtime just flies by
p67
aVbut in reality time is happening to all of us at the same pace
p68
aVthese cycles of time
p69
aVwhether its minutes or hours or days or months or years that go by
p70
aVthese cycles of time
p71
aVanything thats cyclical is naturally repetitive
p72
aVbut anything that is cyclical
p73
aValso has a centrifuge or a centrifugal force
p74
aVa force which is always trying to go away at a tangent from the circle
p75
aVif you ride this centrifugal force of time
p76
aVwe say youre spiritual
p77
aVif you are caught up in the cycle of time
p78
aVthen thats being material
p79
aVif youre crushed by the cycles of time
p80
aVthen we say you are a suffering creature
p81
aVit is the same cycle
p82
aVeither you can be crushed by the cycle
p83
aVor you can trapped in the cycle
p84
aVor you can ride the cycle
p85
aVto ride the cycles of time
p86
aVnot to be trapped in it
p87
aVdefinitely not to be crushed by it
p88
aVtime is crushing experience for a lot of people
p89
aVhmm
p90
aVyes
p91
aVanything cyclical has this ability
p92
aVthat it can crush you
p93
aVor it can trap you
p94
aVor you can ride it
p95
aVin the yogic way of looking at things
p96
aVwe see time
p97
aVtime is referred to as kala
p98
aVkala means both time and space
p99
aVkala means darkness
p100
aVdarkness means that which does not stop light
p101
aVyou understand what im saying
p102
aVif there is light going by you wont see it
p103
aVonly if its stopped by something you see it
p104
aVso that which does not stop light is called darkness
p105
aVso that which does not stop light is empty space
p106
aVso both space and time are referred to as kala
p107
aVbecause they are not seen as two different entities
p108
aVonly because there is time
p109
aVspace is possible
p110
aVbecause there is time
p111
aVyou can move from point a to point b
p112
aVso there is space
p113
aVif there was no time
p114
aVthere was no way to move
p115
aVthe general perception is because there is space
p116
aVthere is time
p117
aVbut i dont see it that way
p118
aVbecause there is time there is space
p119
aVnow
p120
aVthere is time
p121
aVwhich happens because of cycles
p122
aVthe planet spins once its a day
p123
aVthe moon goes around the planet its a month
p124
aVthe planet goes around the sun here we are today 
p125
aVthe cycles of time are one dimension of time
p126
aVtheres another dimension of time
p127
aVwhich is not
p128
aVwhich is beyond the cyclical nature
p129
aVthis we call as the great time
p130
aVits called the mahakala
p131
aVthere is time and there is greater time
p132
aVeven when there are no cycles there is time
p133
aVbut where there is no cyclical movement
p134
aVthere is no physical happening
p135
aVeverything thats physical in the universe
p136
aVfrom what is atomic to what is cosmic
p137
aVeverything is cyclical
p138
aVif there are no cycles happening
p139
aVthere is no physical possible
p140
aVwhen i said if you take a tangent
p141
aVor if you take the centrifugal to ride away from the cycles of time
p142
aVthat means being spiritual
p143
aVits in this context
p144
aVthat we know the cycles of time
p145
aVonly because of physical reality
p146
aVif we could measure
p147
aVif we could measure
p148
aVwhat is the speed of an electron around the proton and neutron
p149
aVwe could keep time
p150
aVatomic time
p151
aVbut a bit too much for us
p152
aVso we measured the planets
p153
aVhow much time it takes to go around the sun
p154
aVthey said its a year
p155
aVwe went little further down to days and hours and minutes and seconds
p156
aVbut all of them are cycles of the physical existence
p157
aVif there is no physical existence
p158
aVwe would not know anything thats cyclical
p159
aVif we did not know what is cyclical movement
p160
aVwe would not know the cyclical nature of the time
p161
aVbut
p162
aVbefore existence manifested in its physical nature
p163
aVthere was time
p164
aVthis is called mahakala
p165
aVthat is an eternal space
p166
aVyoure not watching my words
p167
aVim saying an eternal space
p168
aVwhen there was no movement
p169
aVwhen everything was still
p170
aVthere was time
p171
aVbut nothing cyclical happening
p172
aVthat dimension of time into which everything dissolved
p173
aVand from which everything sprang up
p174
aVwhen certain energy touched it
p175
aVit took to cyclical movement
p176
aVwhen cyclical movement happened physical happened
p177
aVwhen physical happened we could measure time
p178
aVotherwise time was just space
p179
aVso the word kala means both time and space
p180
aVsadhguru we came for a party 
p181
aVand here youre going at us like this 
p182
aVis it
p183
aVit is important to know or rather
p184
aVits important to touch and experience a dimension
p185
aVwhich is not cyclical in nature
p186
aVbecause what is cyclical is inevitably repetitive
p187
aVwhat is cyclical inevitably runs itself out at some point
p188
aVit runs itself down
p189
aVanything thats cyclical cannot be forever
p190
aVbecause it needs a certain amount of kinetic energy
p191
aVwhich is going to expend itself
p192
aVwhen a human being touches a dimension which is not cyclical in nature
p193
aVsuddenly there is a new quality
p194
aVa quality which is beyond all qualities 
p195
aVnot good
p196
aVnot bad
p197
aVnot this not that
p198
aVsimply
p199
aVlike existence
p200
aVtheres nothing high about it
p201
aVnothing low about it
p202
aVits just that you have moved from the surface to the source
p203
aVnot that it solves all your problems
p204
aVits just that you wont know what is a problem 
p205
aVthis i said something about the india situation
p206
aVand this quote is making rounds
p207
aVeven reached the prime minister and he was laughing about it
p208
aVi said for every solution there is a problem 
p209
aVjust see 
p210
aVfor every solution somebody has a problem isnt it 
p211
aVfor people may think for every problem there is a solution
p212
aVbut when you dont see any problems
p213
aVwhen you see only solutions
p214
aVsome people have problems with the solutions 
p215
aVi don't know
p216
aVwhat shall i do
p217
aVwhat shall i do with myself
p218
aVwhich is all and nothing at once
p219
aVwhat shall i do with myself
p220
aVwhich is me and you at once
p221
aVwhat shall i do
p222
aVis this a problem or is this a solution
p223
aVthere may be a space where there are no problems and no solutions
p224
aVjust existence
p225
aVfor someone who pops out of nothing
p226
aVand pops out into nothing
p227
aVwhat is the problem and what is a solution im asking 
p228
aVhello
p229
aVyou popped up from nothing
p230
aVyoure gonna pop out into nothing
p231
aVin this little space and time
p232
aVwhat is the problem and what is the solution
p233
aVi want you to figure this out 
p234
aVhello
p235
aVwhat is the problem
p236
aVhmm
p237
aV theres really no problem no solution actually
p238
aVbut there are so many problems 
p239
aVsadhguru we dont know where you are living 
p240
aVwhere i am living there are so many problems 
p241
aVi am also living among the kind of people that youre living with 
p242
aVyes
p243
aVsame sort 
p244
aVthe question is just what are you rooted into
p245
aVif your rooting is just your physical body
p246
aVsome things are problems
p247
aVsome things are solutions
p248
aVif youre rooted into a psychological framework
p249
aVeverything is a problem 
p250
aVif youre rooted into the existence
p251
aVnothing is a problem
p252
aVnothing is a solution
p253
aVeverything is an experience of life
p254
aVhmm
p255
aVeverything is an experience
p256
aVif i die tomorrow
p257
aVthat is also a very good experience
p258
aVwe dont wish it tomorrow
p259
aVbut if it comes that is also an experience
p260
aVhmm
p261
aVyou dont like it
p262
aVwhether you like it or not it happens
p263
aVyes
p264
aV yes
p265
aV whether you like it or not it happens
p266
aVnot that were wishing it tomorrow
p267
aVbut if it happens tomorrow
p268
aVwhat the hell 
p269
aVwe dont want it tomorrow
p270
aVstill got miles to go before i sleep
p271
aVmiles to go before i sleep  
p272
aVwe dont know how many miles you will go but
p273
aVif you look at life in its full depth and dimension
p274
aVlife is a certain amount of space
p275
aVif you look at life in a linear fashion
p276
aVlife is a certain amount of time
p277
aVif you look at life from your psychological perspective
p278
aVlife is a certain number of problems
p279
aVevery day im meeting all sorts of people
p280
aVthousands of them
p281
aVhow many varieties of problems they have means its unbelievable
p282
aVfor sure for every solution there is a problem 
p283
aVbirth is a problem
p284
aVdeath is a problem
p285
aVin between series of problems
p286
aVserial inventors of problems
p287
aVone cycle is ending a new year is coming
p288
aVits a choice that you have to make
p289
aVare you going to invest your thought and emotion and energy
p290
aVin making up problems
p291
aVor making up solutions
p292
aVor simply enjoying life for what it is
p293
aVits a choice that one has to make
p294
aVoh this is my resolution
p295
aVi wont make any more problems 
p296
aVto make resolutions first you need a constitution
p297
aVdo you have a constitution
p298
aVhello
p299
aVyou dont have a constitution
p300
aVno
p301
aVlike a nation has a constitution
p302
aVa religion has a constitution too
p303
aVone advantage of the constitution of the nation is
p304
aVwe can amend it periodically
p305
aVthe constitution of the religions cannot be amended
p306
aVits fixed 
p307
aVany change means violence will happen 
p308
aVif you suggest an amendment they will kill you
p309
aVthat is their amendment 
p310
aVthe national constitution
p311
aVconstitutions which make nations
p312
aVit is open to debate and amendment
p313
aVim asking you
p314
aVyou as a person
p315
aVdo you have a constitution
p316
aVno no no you have
p317
aVwhat you like
p318
aVwhat you dont like
p319
aVthiss what i will do
p320
aVthiss i wont do
p321
aVim a morning person im a evening person 
p322
aVim a whatsapp person im a email person
p323
aVim a facebook person 
p324
aVthere are constitutions  individual constitutions
p325
aVmaybe not written down but its there isnt it
p326
aVif you can pass a resolution there must be a constitution
p327
aVif there is no constitution
p328
aVhow do you pass a resolution about it
p329
aVso there is
p330
aVonce you have a constitution you are not a life
p331
aVyou are an institution
p332
aVif youre living in an institution you know what it means 
p333
aVit means youre a nutcase 
p334
aVyes
p335
aVno no no not everybody
p336
aVeither youre a nutcase or youre a spiritual aspirant 
p337
aVyes
p338
aVyou are a seeker of sanity
p339
aVor youre a seeker of liberation 
p340
aVone of these things means you live in a institution
p341
aVso what resolution should i take for the new year
p342
aVall resolutions are impositions
p343
aVwhere there is no consciousness
p344
aVwhere there is no awareness to know life
p345
aVfrom the
p346
aVfrom the aliveness of what it is
p347
aVyou wanna fix it
p348
aVif you pass a resolution today
p349
aVin some way youre making sure
p350
aVthat you will not be aware for the next one year
p351
aVbecause awareness means a spontaneous response to life
p352
aVmomenttomoment
p353
aVas a resolution means fixed prefixed
p354
aVif you prefix your life
p355
aVwhether its done by you or done by somebody else
p356
aVif
p357
aVif your government passes a resolution 
p358
aVall of you must hang upside down
p359
aVin india we would say a tamarind tree
p360
aVhere where shall we hang you from
p361
aVtch
p362
aVwhats the famous tree from which they hang people
p363
aVno particular tree
p364
aVhmm
p365
aVwhere to find a oak tree 
p366
aVhmm
p367
aVwhere to find a big oak tree to hang from
p368
aVits difficult to find them
p369
aVin india we say a tamarind tree for a particular reason 
p370
aVso lets say
p371
aVyour government passes a resolution that all of you must hang upside down from a tree
p372
aVwhatever tree 
p373
aVwell give you the choice of the tree 
p374
aVwill you suffer this
p375
aVwill you protest this
p376
aVwill you rebel against it or no
p377
aVhmm
p378
aV yes
p379
aV yes
p380
aVwhether your government passes the resolution or you pass the resolution
p381
aVits not any different
p382
aVyoure trying to achieve something by force
p383
aVanything that you try to do by force
p384
aVfeels like youre hanging upside down
p385
aVyes or no
p386
aVyou want to be like this but you want to do this
p387
aVyou will feel like youre hanging upside down
p388
aVwhen you hang upside down
p389
aVyou will feel like rebelling against it
p390
aVso naturally
p391
aVwithin three days your resolutions will become dissolutions 
p392
aVotherwise you suffer hanging upside down
p393
aVvery few suffer the entire year
p394
aVsome will dissolve this in three days
p395
aVsome in three weeks
p396
aVsome in three months
p397
aVbut the very fact that they need one more resolution by the year end is
p398
aVa proof that did not did not last the year
p399
aVso there is no need to take any resolutions but
p400
aVa resolution is made because you want to do something
p401
aVthat you naturally dont not inclined towards
p402
aVbut the simple thing is
p403
aVare you naturally inclined to be joyful or miserable
p404
aV joyful
p405
aV that was only five people 
p406
aVare you naturally inclined to be joyful or miserable
p407
aV joyful
p408
aV the little ones
p409
aV joyful
p410
aV so you can consciously
p411
aVyou can make an attempt to be conscious
p412
aVthat joyful is my natural inclination
p413
aVso how joyful will i be in the coming year
p414
aVjust keep accounts
p415
aVhmm
p416
aVsee lot of people whore doing business
p417
aVthey think theyre keeping accounts only for the sake of irs 
p418
aVno no
p419
aVyou keep accounts not for the sake of irs
p420
aVbecause if you do not keep accounts
p421
aVyou do not know whether youre making profit or loss
p422
aVthats the idea of accounts isnt it
p423
aVwhether youre moving forward or backward
p424
aVto know this
p425
aVyou need an account book
p426
aVwhy dont you keep an account book
p427
aVat the end of the day just check
p428
aVam i little more joyful today than yesterday
p429
aVtch
p430
aVif you had done this since you were five years of age
p431
aVyou would have been ecstatic by now
p432
aVprofit side 
p433
aVbecame like this because you never kept accounts
p434
aVone day you checked when it became very acute
p435
aVthen you see you are in a big loss 
p436
aVevery day
p437
aVevery month just keep accounts
p438
aVam i becoming more joyful or less joyful
p439
aVtherere only two things
p440
aVhow joyful are you
p441
aVand how much joy do you give to people around you
p442
aVthis you can keep accounts
p443
aVhmm
p444
aVif you keep accounts of this
p445
aVpeople are keeping accounts of their money
p446
aVas if theyre gonna carry it with them
p447
aVthe real wealth of life is how joyful you are
p448
aVhow wonderful is your experience of life
p449
aVjoy is not a goal by itself
p450
aVbut its a necessary ambiance for life
p451
aVif you dont set this one ambiance
p452
aVthen whatever you have is just going waste
p453
aVhmm
p454
aVyou may have health thats going waste
p455
aVbecause  there are more people on this planet
p456
aVwhore healthy and miserable
p457
aVthan unhealthy and miserable
p458
aVat least if youre
p459
aVat least if youre unhealthy you got a good enough excuse
p460
aVfor your misery
p461
aVhmm
p462
aVyoure healthy and miserable there is no excuse
p463
aVi want you to just understand this
p464
aVits just not smart to be miserable 
p465
aVhmm
p466
aVthis happened
p467
aVa lady was driving
p468
aVtch and then she had a flat tire
p469
aVshe had never really done this 
p470
aVthis changing tire business
p471
aVbut she read the instruction manual
p472
aVshe put the jack and lifted up the car
p473
aVshe undid the wheel
p474
aVwith great difficulty she pulled out the heavy wheel from the boot
p475
aVand was trying to fix it
p476
aVand these four nuts that she had
p477
aVshe had kept it in the hub cap
p478
aVand with her high heels she was struggling
p479
aVand she stepped on the hub cap
p480
aVand all the four nuts flew in different directions
p481
aVso she put the new tire but she had no nuts
p482
aVtch
p483
aVthen she was cursing and wondering and miserable
p484
aVwhat the hell to do now
p485
aVand she was little nervous
p486
aVbecause she was hearing all kinds of noises from a mental institution
p487
aVwhich was across the street 
p488
aVthen on the third floor
p489
aVthere was a young man looking out of the window
p490
aVwatching this lady
p491
aVthen he said
p492
aVhey lady look here
p493
aVall you need to do is
p494
aVtake oneone nut out of the three wheels
p495
aVand put the three nuts on this
p496
aVyou can drive to the gas station
p497
aVwith three nuts you can drive no problem
p498
aVshe did that
p499
aVand she got the car down on the road
p500
aVthen she looked up at him and said
p501
aVyoure so smart why are you here 
p502
aVhe said i may be nuts but im not stupid 
p503
aVits all right to be little crazy
p504
aVbut you dont have to be stupid
p505
aVall the socalled smart people whove become 
p506
aVlike theyre practicing a posture for their grave  you know
p507
aVwhen i look at lot of people
p508
aVi think theyre practicing 
p509
aVtheyre doing pretty well 
p510
aVbut what they dont understand is
p511
aVit doesnt take practice
p512
aVwhen you die it happens 
p513
aVyes
p514
aV yes
p515
aV do you think you need to practice
p516
aVno 
p517
aVbecause you cant improve death with practice
p518
aVbut you can improve life with practice
p519
aVyes or no
p520
aV yes
p521
aV however you do life
p522

aV but death happens super efficiently for everybody
p526
aVyou cant improve upon that
p527
aVyou think you can improve
p528
aVno
p529
aVyou dont have to practice your final posture right now 
p530
aVitll come naturally believe me
p531
aVits not like life therere no difficulties there
p532
aVitll come very naturally
p533
aVyou will do perfectly well in the grave 
p534
aVyou dont have to have any doubt
p535
aVit doesnt need any preparation
p536
aVwhen you die you will get it
p537
aVhmm
p538
aVbut now with life
p539
aVthere is so much to do and more
p540
aVhow much ever you do
p541
aVtheres something more to do about life isnt it
p542
aVif you want to be at it
p543
aVthe fundamental ambiance is that youre joyful
p544
aVotherwise you will get this tremendously intelligent idiotic question 
p545
aVto be or not to be 
p546
aVyes
p547
aVintellectually seems very profound
p548
aVbut its the most idiotic question
p549
aVyou dont have to decide not to be
p550
aVit will happen
p551
aVthere were many idiots like you
p552
aVcountless number of idiots like you on this planet whore gone
p553
aVthey dont have to worry about to be or not to be now
p554
aVanyway theyre not to be
p555
aVthis is our time on this planet

aVyes
p557
aV yes
p558
aV this is our time on this planet
p559
aVwhat are we going to do
p560
aVthats the question
p561
aVare we going to make this into an exuberant
p562
aVjoyful
p563
aVwonderful planet
p564
aVor we going to make this into a miserable
p565
aVhorrible planet
p566
aVthis is our time
p567
aVwe are free to do either way
p568
aVthe choice is yours
p569
aVi wont tell you
p570
aVtake a resolution that you will make this into a wonderful planet
p571
aVthere is no such thing
p572
aVthe natural inclination of life is for pleasantness
p573
aVif you choose to be very pleasant within yourself
p574
aVpleasant things will happen
p575
aVif youre feeling horrible within you
p576
aVand you try to do wonderful things
p577
aVthen i want you to understand 
p578
aVthe worst tyrants on the planet
p579
aVthose who topped the baddie list historically
p580
aVill pick up the worst of the lot
p581
aVyou take somebody like adolf hitler or benito mussolini
p582
aVthey really believed
p583
aVthey are going to create a wonderful world
p584
aVyou know this
p585
aVthey had a dream of an ideal world
p586
aVwhen you have horrible things going within you
p587
aVand you go at the world with very energetically
p588
aVwhat you will create is a horrendous reality
p589
aVbefore you touch the world
p590
aVif you want to clean somebodys face
p591
aVyour hands must be clean isnt it
p592
aVyes or no
p593
aV yes
p594
aV your hands are not clean
p595
aVyou try to touch this 
p596
aVthiss not gonna work
p597
aVso before you touch the outside world
p598
aVthis much you must do to with yourself that you are pleasant
p599
aVwhen you are pleasant
p600
aVwhatever you touch will become pleasant
p601
aVyou are unpleasant
p602
aVbut you have good intentions
p603
aVit is no good
p604
aVi want you to understand
p605
aVright now in the world
p606
aVone situation that is happening in certain parts of the world
p607
aVwhich almost everybody in the world sees
p608
aVas the most horrible things that can happen
p609
aVthey believe theyre creating gods own kingdom
p610
aVyes or no
p611
aV yes
p612
aV they onehundred percent believe
p613
aVyou may question their intelligence
p614
aVyou cannot question their integrity
p615
aVbecause theyre willing to die for it
p616
aVwhen a man is willing to die for something
p617
aVyou cannot question his integrity isnt it
p618
aVyou can question his intelligence and judgment
p619
aVbut you cannot question his integrity
p620
aVbecause when i stake my life
p621
aVyou must know i mean it  isnt it
p622
aVim not playing fool with it
p623
aVit means more to me than my life
p624
aVyes or no
p625
aV yes
p626
aV i want you to know you have anger and hatred going within you
p627
aVbut you want to create a wonderful world 
p628
aVwhat happens
p629
aVthe consequence of that is a horrendous reality
p630
aVits not by intention that the world will change
p631
aVit is by your consciousness that the world will change
p632
aVhow you are within yourself
p633
aVif we dont fix this one thing
p634
aVwe will have intentions and intentions
p635
aVthe worst things have happened on the planet with good intentions
p636
aVnot with bad intentions
p637
aVyes or no
p638
aV yes
p639
aV the most horrendous things have happened with very good intentions
p640
aVso what intention you have is not important
p641
aVwhat is your inner nature
p642
aVthis is important
p643
aVevery action that humanbeings are doing in their life
p644
aVknowingly or unknowingly
p645
aVis in pursuit of their well being
p646
aVand you know you feel well only when you are joyful
p647
aVhello
p648
aVyes
p649
aVyou feel really well only when you are joyful isn't it
p650
aVor in other words
p651
aVevery single action that human beings perform
p652
aVis in pursuit of their happiness or joy
p653
aVif they were joyful by their own nature
p654
aVevery action that you perform would become conscious
p655
aVinstead of being compulsive isnt it
p656
aVthis is all you have to do to yourself
p657
aVthis year
p658
aVthe coming year
p659
aVand the coming coming year and for the rest of your life
p660
aVyou just have to keep accounts
p661
aVfrom yesterday to today
p662
aVam i little more joyful
p663
aVam i
p664
aVyou dont even have to worry about giving joy
p665
aVif youre joyful you will spread joy
p666
aVyes
p667
aVwill you keep accounts im asking
p668
aV yes
p669
aV or shall i set irs upon you 
p670
aVdo you need enforcement 
p671
aVmost societies have been run for a long time by enforcement
p672
aVso if theres nobody to enforce  
p673
aVno
p674
aVthats not what happens
p675
aVif there is nobody to enforce anything
p676
aVyou become joyful isnt it 
p677
aVi want you to understand this 
p678
aVthe different between a resolution
p679
aVand moving towards the natural inclination of life
p680
aVif there is nobody enforcing anything upon you
p681
aVdo you become miserable or joyful
p682
aV joyful
p683
aV so you dont have to enforce any resolutions upon yourself
p684
aVjust little tools to make sure that you dont sink
p685
aVjust keeping accounts
p686
aVdaily
p687
aVevery day before you go to bed
p688
aVyou must check
p689
aVwhether youre little more joyful today than yesterday okay
p690
aVif you keep this up
p691
aVby the time youre thirty
p692
aVyou will be ecstatic 
p693
aVwhen i was 
p694
aVwhen i was just twentyfive
p695
aVtch
p696
aVi simply sat down with my eyes closed
p697
aVevery cell in my body was dripping ecstasy
p698
aVnameless ecstasies
p699
aVthen i realized this is it
p700
aVnothing to be done
p701
aVif you dont mess with your mind
p702
aVyoure ecstatic
p703
aVthe fool that i was i made a plan 
p704
aVin twoandahalf to three years time
p705
aVim going to make the entire world ecstatic
p706
aVbecause theres nothing to do
p707
aVif you simply sit here  you know
p708
aVthirtyfive years  
p709
aVi have not lost it
p710
aVa few people have gotten it
p711
aVyes
p712
aVquite a few people have gotten it
p713
aVbut still not the world 
p714
aVmaking some estimates and
p715
aVon an average
p716
aVin the last three years time
p717
aVwe should be touching nearly hundred million people a year
p718
aVbut still thats not the world 
p719
aVno no no dont dont
p720
aVdont enjoy my failures 
p721
aVmy idea of the world is 73 billion people
p722
aVtch
p723
aVhundred million is not a success
p724
aVit looks like im destined to die a failure
p725
aVbut ill die a blissful failure
p726
aVbecause me being blissful is not dependent upon the results of my actions
p727
aV
p728
aVmy actions are rooted in my blissfulness
p729
aVthis is how life needs to be conducted
p730
aVthat your actions are rooted in your joyfulness and blissfulness
p731
aVthat joy is not a result of something that you do
p732
aVthe moment it is a result of something that you do
p733
aVit will fly away in no time
p734
aVbecause our actions in the world
p735
aVnot always are they successful
p736
aVhmm
p737
aVhowever well you do it
p738
aVyes or no
p739
aVhowever well you do it
p740
aVnot always are they successful
p741
aVour actions are subject to various realities
p742
aVmany forces have to come together for the success of any action
p743
aVnot always they will fall together
p744
aVso if your joy
p745
aVif your way of being is enslaved to the success of your activity
p746
aVthen you being joyful is a very remote possibility
p747
aVand above all
p748
aVwhat will happen is
p749
aVwhen you perform actions
p750
aVif they dont succeed
p751
aVif youre going to become miserable
p752
aVafter a couple of burns
p753
aVthen you will shrink
p754
aVyou will see how to restrict your life to minimal activity so that
p755
aVyou will enjoy maximum success
p756
aVif you cripple yourself you know
p757
aVif you cripple yourself
p758
aVyou can participate in a race with people
p759
aVsuppose you have only one leg
p760
aVthen you participate in a race
p761
aVwith somebody who does not have both the legs
p762
aVand of course you win
p763
aVthis is what most people are trying to do
p764
aVthe moment there is fear of suffering
p765
aVof failure
p766
aVwhat you will do is cripple yourself
p767
aVrestrict your activity
p768
aVonly when failure doesnt matter
p769
aVthat you can go through your failure blissfully
p770
aVyou will do everything that you can do
p771
aVwho cares whether it happens or not
p772
aVwe will do it and well do it well
p773
aVif it happens its great
p774
aVif it doesnt happen its very great
p775
aVbecause we can do it all over again 
p776
aVjoy is not a consequence of life or activity of life
p777
aVjoy is a natural ambiance which is necessary
p778
aVif you have to
p779
aVtomorrow morning if you have to wake up
p780
aVand want to do something
p781
aVyou no you need to have some joy in you 
p782
aVotherwise to be or not to be 
p783
aVwill it come or not
p784
aVsuppose you wake up and you
p785
aVtomorrow morning youre bereft of joy
p786
aVnothing in you
p787
aVyoull wonder why am i here
p788
aVyes or no
p789
aVone day one twentyfour hours completely joyless
p790
aVwill you wonder
p791
aVwhat the hell im doing here
p792
aVyes or no
p793
aV yes
p794
aV because this is the nature of life
p795
aVif this life has to blossom
p796
aVit needs the ambiance of joy
p797
aVso we have given you the tools  to live joyfully
p798
aVyou must keep accounts
p799
aVhmm
p800
aV yes
p801
aV  yes 
p802
aVi got it 
p803
aVbefore they serve food and music is ready and the party is ready
p804
aVi dont want to take any more time
p805
aVif there is a question that you can't go into the new year
p806
aVwithout being answered
p807
aVif there is such a question  okay
p808
aVnot that you must ask a question
p809
aVif there is such a question okay
p810
aVno
p811
aVit works only if you speak 
p812
aV namaskaram sadhguru
p813
aV mhmm 
p814
aV i have thousands of burning questions 
p815
aVbut i thank you immensely for giving me this opportunity to ask one question
p816
aVhow do i get rid of some unconscious bad habits in my life
p817
aVwhen i see that i have overcome some of those bad habits
p818
aVi see that it comes back again in my life
p819
aVhow do i just totally get rid of this and become free out of it
p820
aV see you must understand that please
p821
aVthere is no such thing as good habit and bad habit
p822
aVall habits are bad 
p823
aVbecause habit means youre unconscious
p824
aVyou think only bad habits are unconscious
p825
aVno
p826
aVeven the socalled good habits
p827
aVhabit means you have learned to function in an automated way
p828
aVthat means you dont do things consciously
p829
aVfor example
p830
aVis brushing your teeth in the morning
p831
aVa good habit or a bad habit 
p832
aVeven you
p833
aVi thought you would be free from a habit 
p834
aVthere are two ways of brushing your teeth
p835
aVbecause youve been regimented to brush your teeth
p836
aVyou get up and ffff  
p837
aVor because you wake up
p838
aVyoure very sensitive
p839
aVif you open your mouth
p840
aVyoure conscious enough 
p841
aVmost of the time
p842
aVyoure not conscious enough
p843
aVonly other people know 
p844
aVthis is a very strange thing
p845
aVthere is the apparatus
p846
aVthe olfactory apparatus
p847
aVwhich smell which have a sense of smell right here 
p848
aVabove your mouth 
p849
aVbut you dont get it
p850
aVothers get it five feet away 
p851
aVthat means youre unconscious isn't it
p852
aVyes
p853
aV yes
p854
aV if youre conscious you would still brush your teeth
p855
aVtill you come to such a place
p856
aVwhen you open your mouth in the morning
p857
aVit smells like fragrance you become like a flower
p858
aVtill that happens
p859
aVyou must consciously brush 
p860
aVif you consciously brush
p861
aVon different days
p862
aVor different mornings
p863
aVit may need different length
p864
aVor different amount of brushing
p865
aVnot every day brushing is same requirement
p866
aVbut because youre regimented
p867
aVthree minutes i must wear my teeth out 
p868
aVif you were conscious
p869
aVon a particular day you would brush as it is necessary for that day
p870
aVthats how it should be
p871
aVon a particular day
p872
aVyou would eat as it is necessary for the body
p873
aVyou would sleep as it is necessary for the body
p874
aVyou would do everything consciously
p875
aVbut now it's a habit
p876
aVeverything is a habit
p877
aVwhat time you should go to bed
p878
aVwhat time you should wake up
p879
aVwhat you should eat
p880
aVwhat you should not eat 
p881
aVeverything by prescription
p882
aVthis is called slavery
p883
aVyour doctor tells you
p884
aVor your slave master tells you what you should eat today
p885
aVi dont see what's the difference
p886
aVwhy is it that you do not know
p887
aVwhat this body needs today
p888
aVbecause no consciousness
p889
aVeverything by regimentation
p890
aVby habit
p891
aVhabit is regimentation isn't it
p892
aVit's only by regimentation you become habitual
p893
aVso in this you have also identified something as good habit
p894
aVand something as bad habit
p895
aVwhat to do
p896
aVis there something called as bad unconsciousness
p897
aVand good unconsciousness
p898
aVthats what youre saying
p899
aVwhen you say i have a good habit
p900
aVyoure saying im unconscious in a nice way 
p901
aVit's like  saying
p902
aVim dead in a nice way 
p903
aVbecause the fundamental difference
p904
aVbetween being alive and being dead is
p905
aVbeing conscious and being totally unconscious
p906
aVbeing partially unconscious is being partially dead
p907
aVas i earlier told you
p908
aVyoure trying to practice the posture 
p909
aVand the state of what it means to be dead
p910
aVdo not fix any kind of habit
p911
aVjust see
p912
aVsee the idea of withdrawing into retreats
p913
aVcoming to a spiritual space is just this 
p914
aVto find space where you can do everything consciously
p915
aVwhen you were in a race
p916
aVyou could not be conscious
p917
aVyou got mad
p918
aVand you somehow fixed some habits
p919
aVthrough which you managed to go through your daily office routine
p920
aVwhen you come to a spiritual space
p921
aVthis is what youre supposed to do 
p922
aVthat you watch what is the requirement of your body
p923
aVwhat is the requirement of your mind
p924
aVwhat is the requirement of your emotion
p925
aVwhat is the requirement of your energy
p926
aVwhat does this life  need
p927
aVwhat does it naturally long for
p928
aVto consciously watch this
p929
aVonce you consciously know that this is what it is longing for
p930
aVthen there is no two ways about it
p931
aVotherwise you think youre on the spiritual path because of me
p932
aVthats a crime against me 
p933
aVyes 
p934
aVif youre unconscious its a crime against yourself
p935
aVbut youre doing something that you think is spiritual
p936
aVbecause of me
p937
aVthats a crime against me
p938
aVtch
p939
aVyou better do crime against yourself not against me 
p940
aVso how do i get rid of habits
p941
aVyou dont have to get rid of habits
p942
aVit is like
p943
aVwhat youre asking is
p944
aVhow do i get rid of my unconsciousness
p945
aVwhen you use the word un
p946
aVwe are suggesting a nonexistence
p947
aVnot an existence isn't it
p948
aVconsciousness is
p949
aVwhen consciousness is not there
p950
aVthat is called unconsciousness
p951
aVhow to get rid of something that does not exist
p952
aVim saying youre playing a trick with yourself
p953
aVit's like
p954
aVsuppose this this hall is dark
p955
aVhow to get rid of this darkness
p956
aVkick it out
p957
aVhmm
p958
aVall of you together im sure you can kick out of the darkness
p959
aVyou will get into an insane effort
p960
aVyouve been on it
p961
aVhmm
p962
aVthis insane effort to get rid of unconsciousness
p963
aVno
p964
aVto get rid of darkness you just have to light it up
p965
aVif you light it up
p966
aVdarkness is gone
p967
aVbecause darkness is not an existence by itself
p968
aVit's just the absence of light
p969
aVsimilarly unconsciousness is not an existence of itself
p970
aVit is just absence of consciousness
p971
aVif you become conscious
p972
aVdo you have to fight with unconscious
p973
aVhmm
p974
aVif youre conscious
p975
aVdo you have to fight with unconscious habits
p976
aV no
p977
aV no so you need to work on consciousness to become conscious
p978
aVoh what should i do
p979
aVyou should not do unconscious things 
p980
aVbecause the essence of life is being conscious
p981
aVyou know that youre alive only because youre reasonably conscious isn't it
p982
aVyes or no
p983
aV yes
p984
aV youre fast asleep
p985
aVdo you know youre dead or alive
p986
aVdo you know
p987
aV no
p988
aV no
p989
aVwhy because youre not conscious
p990
aVwhen youre not conscious
p991
aVyou do not even know whether youre dead or alive isn't it
p992
aVnow you know that youre alive
p993
aVbecause youre somewhat conscious
p994
aVnow we just have to raise the wick a little bit to become more conscious
p995
aVthats what were working on
p996
aVthere are many things which has gathered inertia
p997
aVyour physical body
p998
aV30 drum in the morning
p999
aVyour mind has got into its own habitual patterns
p1000
aVthats why me torturing you with all this
p1001
aVyour energies have followed the requirement of body and mind
p1002
aVand theyve gotten into their own patterns 
p1003
aVthat is why the sadhana
p1004
aVthe idea is to break the cycles of unconsciousness and become conscious
p1005
aVwhen you become conscious
p1006
aVit looks like youre in unknown terrain
p1007
aVsuddenly everything seems to be difficult
p1008
aVwhen you were going habitually it looked like everything was easy but
p1009
aVsee when i 
p1010
aVwhen i went into the coimbatore prison
p1011
aVno
p1012
aVi went there unqualified you know 
p1013
aVwhen i went there to conduct a program 
p1014
aValmost twentyfive twentyfour twentyfive years ago
p1015
aVi just observed 
p1016
aVthis is something a whole lot of people are seeking in their life
p1017
aVprison life
p1018
aVbecause this is a place where somebody always opens the doors for you
p1019
aVand they close it for you
p1020
aVthey turn off the lights for you
p1021
aVthey do everything for you
p1022
aVyou dont have to do anything  really
p1023
aVfood comes bang on time  always
p1024
aVby the second im telling you
p1025
aVtun means food is ready
p1026
aVeverything is great in this prison
p1027
aVi thought this is a great place
p1028
aVonly thing is it's enforced
p1029
aVbut this is what a whole lot of people are seeking
p1030
aVsystems in their life
p1031
aVyes
p1032
aVwhen it is done to you you will suffer it im telling you 
p1033
aVwhen it is done to you youll suffer it
p1034
aVactually for a whole lot of people
p1035
aVprison life is far more
p1036
aVit is far more organized  what they dream of in their life
p1037
aVit's far more efficient
p1038
aVfar more nutritious 
p1039
aVand most of them are very fit and healthy
p1040
aVbut if you enter the prison
p1041
aVthere is suffering in the air
p1042
aVnot once  i have been there hundreds of times to various prisons 
p1043
aVnot once have i stepped out of the prison without tears in my eyes because
p1044
aVthere is suffering in the air
p1045
aVthe pain in the air is unbearable
p1046
aVbecause one thing that a human being suffers most is lack of freedom 
p1047
aVnot lack of comfort
p1048
aVnot lack of wealth
p1049
aVnot lack of this and that
p1050
aVonce freedom is taken away
p1051
aVa human being suffers immensely
p1052
aVeverything is correct
p1053
aVprison life is far more comfortable than going to work and coming back
p1054
aVgetting stuck in the traffic
p1055
aVgoing through all these problems
p1056
aVyou are a state guest you know 
p1057
aVreally
p1058
aVif youre looking for a comfortable
p1059
aVno surprises kind of life 
p1060
aVif you suffer every little thing sh
p1061
aVeverything shocks you
p1062
aVeverything makes you go through stress and tension
p1063
aVprison life is perfect 
p1064
aVeverything is in order
p1065
aVno surprises
p1066
aVeverything is just right
p1067
aVeven the menu is written down 
p1068
aVnext seven days what's the menu
p1069
aVit's there and it goes by that
p1070
aVnothing more nothing more nothing less
p1071
aVone bean more means somebody will be taken to task 
p1072
aVeverything is correct
p1073
aVthose who are looking for a correct life
p1074
aVprison is the best place 
p1075
aVbut a human being will suffer immensely when everything is correct
p1076
aVyes or no
p1077
aV yes
p1078
aV everything is correct but no freedom 
p1079
aVpeople will suffer this immensely
p1080
aVso you need to understand
p1081
aVhabit means you have caused a little prison of your own
p1082
aVand you will suffer this after some time
p1083
aVinitially it looks like efficiency
p1084
aVafter some time
p1085
aVit is imprisonment
p1086
aVprison is in many ways an epitome of efficiency isn't it
p1087
aVbut efficiency is not what this life  is looking for
p1088
aVthis life  is looking for expansion
p1089
aVthis life  wants the freedom to expand always
p1090
aVi was talking to one of this management specialists from america
p1091
aVa very wellknown man 
p1092
aVlet me not mention the names
p1093
aVso he was propounding all his management principles
p1094
aVwhich if
p1095
aVwhich looked like a prison cell to me 
p1096
aVbringing order to everything
p1097
aVso that it's efficient
p1098
aVsee there are two ways of looking at this
p1099
aVthere is a manicured garden which looks very perfect
p1100
aVthere is forest which looks like chaos
p1101
aVbut the manicured garden
p1102
aVif you dont manage it for one month its finished
p1103
aVtheres no garden left
p1104
aVa forest has managed itself for a million years
p1105
aVand still going on
p1106
aVwhich is more efficient
p1107
aVwhich is more orderly
p1108
aV forest
p1109
aV forest is far more orderly and far more efficient
p1110
aVbut it is not fitting into your logical framework thats all
p1111
aVthis is what enlightenment means
p1112
aVthat from being a manicured garden
p1113
aVyou become a forest because
p1114
aVit sustains upon itself
p1115
aVit doesnt need anything from outside
p1116
aVnobody need to water it
p1117
aVnobody need to manure it
p1118
aVnobody need to come and trim it
p1119
aVeverything happens within itself
p1120
aVyes or no
p1121
aV yes
p1122
aV if you leave it for a million years itll still be there
p1123
aVonly if you meddle with it it may go away
p1124
aVotherwise it will sustain itself because it is an efficiency of chaos
p1125
aVwe call something chaos not because it is inefficient
p1126
aVwe call something chaos because it doesnt fit in to our logical framework
p1127
aVso habit means you have become a slave of your own logic
p1128
aVand after some time
p1129
aVthe moment you form a habit
p1130
aVit is unconscious isn't it
p1131
aVso what you need to get rid of is not habits
p1132
aVyou have to become conscious
p1133
aVif you become more conscious and youre not unconscious
p1134
aVthen there is no such thing as habit
p1135
aVyou will do what's right for you now
p1136
aVso ninehundredandninetynine questions
p1137
aVplease live with it for 2017 
p1138
aVall the best

aV my heart is like a singing bird whose nest is in a watered shoe
p1175
aVmy heart is like an apple tree
p1176
aVwhose boughs are bound by thick sap fruit
p1177
aVmy heart is like a rainbow show that paddles in the sea
p1178
aVmy heart is gladder than all these because my love has come to me
p1179
aVraise me days of silk and down
p1180
aVcovered in peacocks and doves and pea pomegranates and peacocks with one hundred eyes

aVbecause the birthday of my life has come

aV  what a sweet poem 
p1185
aV im sorry 
p1186
aVyou know were washed away by
p1187
aVwe lost the question you know 
p1188
aVokay okay practices practices 
p1189
aV if only if i get to do that
p1190
aVthat would be amazing 
p1191
aV im sorry
p1192
aV that was lovely the kids getting to hug you
p1193
aVit was amazing 
p1194
aV hmm what is that
p1195
aV the kids getting to hug you was amazing you know
p1196
aVso its okay
p1197
aV but you dont have a sweet poem like her 
p1198
aVoh when you said the book you know im supposed to finish this book before 3rd of january
p1199
aVso im working on that book
p1200
aVwhen you said the book 
p1201
aVi was just thinking book book book
p1202
aVbecause this book is bothering me for last few days
p1203
aVim supposed to complete it by 3rd january 
p1204
aVwere writing a book on adiyogi
p1205
aVim to give it to the publisher by 3rd january and
p1206
aVso thats the book on my mind
p1207
aVyoure talking about the old book 
p1208
aVold book
p1209
aVokay 
p1210
aVthe practice that is taught in the inner engineering program needs twentyone minutes
p1211
aVyou need to sit in one place and do it
p1212
aVit is of a different nature
p1213
aVit is
p1214
aVit is a process which can change
p1215
aVto start with
p1216
aVthe chemistry of your system
p1217
aVmany of you have experienced this
p1218
aVafter a few months of practice
p1219
aVif you look back and see
p1220
aVall those littlelittle things which were so significant
p1221
aVdont seem to bother you anymore
p1222
aVtheyre just gone
p1223
aVsimply because the chemistry has changed
p1224
aVyou know when chemistry changes things change 
p1225
aVin whatever way you have known it
p1226
aVbut there are other dimensions to human chemistry
p1227
aVthat instead of being a volatile reactive chemistry
p1228
aVcan become a very selfcontained chemistry
p1229
aVwhich is pleasant and on
p1230
aVthe practices in the book are not
p1231
aVsitting down and doing practices
p1232
aVyou could be doing it anywhere
p1233
aVyou could be driving
p1234
aVyou could be working in your office
p1235
aVyou could be walking on the street
p1236
aVand still be doing it
p1237
aVtheyre of that nature
p1238
aVor in other words the practices in the book are
p1239
aVjust to bring a certain amount of consciousness
p1240
aVthe book did not have these practices to start with
p1241
aVbut when i travelled around in america
p1242
aVeverybody was talking about being mindful 
p1243
aVthen i saw
p1244
aVby being mindful what they will do to themselves
p1245
aVmy entire work is to bring you to a certain sense of abandon
p1246
aVthat you can be here like youre not here
p1247
aVif you sit here
p1248
aVyou dont even know whether your body is here
p1249
aVif you sit like this
p1250
aVfirst thing is you dont have a gender
p1251
aVyou dont even have a body
p1252
aVso where is the question of a gender
p1253
aVif you simply sit like this
p1254
aVthere is no time for you
p1255
aVjust look at this
p1256
aVonly because you have a body
p1257
aVyour body is keeping time
p1258
aVhmm
p1259
aVyour legs are telling you how long youve been sitting
p1260
aVyes or no 
p1261
aVhmm
p1262
aV yes
p1263
aV suppose you had no legs
p1264
aVyou would have no sense of time
p1265
aVif you had no back
p1266
aVno sense of time at all
p1267
aVif you had no body no time at all isnt it
p1268
aVyour body is keeping time from womb to tomb it is keeping time
p1269
aVfrom bathroom break to bathroom break it is keeping time
p1270
aVfrom wakeup to sleep it is keeping time
p1271
aVyes or no
p1272
aV yes
p1273
aV once its time itll do aaaaa 
p1274
aVyou dont have to look at the watch
p1275
aVonce a certain time is up
p1276
aVyour body will do aaaaa
p1277
aVyes or no
p1278
aVright now youve seen that old time machines with sand trickling away
p1279
aVlike that the bladder is keeping time 
p1280
aVdrop drop drop 
p1281
aVas it fills up
p1282
aVyou know whats the time
p1283
aVlegs are keeping the time
p1284
aVif youd done your practices regularly
p1285
aVi mean the tch the program practices
p1286
aVnot the book practices
p1287
aVif youd done the program practices regularly
p1288
aVyour legs can deceive time
p1289
aVyou
p1290
aVyour legs dont know whats the time
p1291
aVyour legs know 
p1292
aVbook book practice 
p1293
aVso the program practices are of a different nature
p1294
aVthat cannot be transmitted
p1295
aVunless a certain amount of preparation and
p1296
aVits a transmission
p1297
aVits not a teaching
p1298
aVbook is a teaching
p1299
aVthere is a big difference between teaching and transmission
p1300
aVdo not misunderstand both as one
p1301
aVthis is a way of creating a smaller step for people
p1302
aVbecause people are not willing to take one big step
p1303
aVone small step
p1304
aVthey read the book and if some small things change
p1305
aVthey may take the program
p1306
aVbut there is no substitute for sitting properly with eyes closed
p1307
aVand doing what is being done properly
p1308
aVand not only that
p1309
aVthere is no substitute for a transmission
p1310
aVif something is not transmitted
p1311
aVnothing new till happen
p1312
aVimprovement of the present will happen
p1313
aVnothing new will happen
p1314
aVwith shambhavi we are not looking at improving you
p1315
aVwe want something new to sprout in you
p1316
aVsomething that was never there with you till that moment must happen within you
p1317
aVthats the intent
p1318
aVthe book is trying to decorate the
p1319
aVexisting
p1320
aVwhatever you are right now to make a little improvement
p1321
aVmost people are looking for improvements in life
p1322
aVthey are not looking for transformation
p1323
aVtransformation means nothing of the old should remain
p1324
aVthats transformation
p1325
aVbut most people cling to the old
p1326
aVwill you leave 2016
p1327
aVor will you carry it with you
p1328
aVhmm
p1329
aVcan you
p1330
aVthough it leaves you you will not leave it 
p1331
aV2016 will leave you but you will not leave 2016 isnt it
p1332
aV yes
p1333
aV because you are a creature of memories
p1334
aVif you are a creature of memories
p1335
aVyou are a creature of the past
p1336
aVhmm
p1337
aVthat means you are a dinosaur which is extinct 
p1338
aVyouve become big because of your memories isnt it
p1339
aVbut youre extinct
p1340
aVtch
p1341
aVwhat is the use
p1342
aVdinosaur was a big creature but doesnt exist
p1343
aVwhat is the use im asking
p1344
aVlike this if you live in your memory
p1345
aVyou are big but what is the use
p1346
aVwhat is needed is to reverberate with what is there now
p1347
aVmemory is good to handle the world
p1348
aVits good only to handle the world
p1349
aVits no good to handle this one  isnt it
p1350
aVdo you understand what im saying
p1351
aVmemory is good to handle the world around us
p1352
aVwe need to remember what happened 
p1353
aVwhat happened with this person
p1354
aVwhat happened with that person
p1355
aVwhat happened with that situation and this situation
p1356
aVwe need to remember
p1357
aVit is useful to address the world
p1358
aVbut with your silly memory
p1359
aVyou cannot address this one
p1360
aVit doesnt mean anything
p1361
aVthis one you can address only with consciousness
p1362
aVthere is no other way
p1363
aVotherwise you wont have this one
p1364
aVyou have assembly of things
p1365
aVsee let me address something very sensitive
p1366
aVi want you to listen to this carefully otherwise youll come to wrong conclusions
p1367
aVlets say somebody very dear to you dies
p1368
aVor they go away for some reason
p1369
aVyou feel like you lost everything
p1370
aVyes or no
p1371
aVyou feel like you lost everything
p1372
aVbecause you are making up a life of substitution
p1373
aVwhere you are not there
p1374
aVyou filled it up with other people
p1375
aVwhen they go away there is vacuum
p1376
aVbut thats not how life is happening
p1377
aVbecause you are there
p1378
aVonly because you are there
p1379
aVyou can hold relationships with people isnt it
p1380
aVhello
p1381
aV yes
p1382
aV but now in your experience you are not there
p1383
aVbecause you are a creature of memory
p1384
aVyou can only remember this one and that one and that one
p1385
aVyou cant remember this one
p1386
aVhow can you remember this one
p1387
aVbecause this is a current life
p1388
aVyou cannot remember this one
p1389
aVbecause youre handling everything by memory
p1390
aVyou will see
p1391
aVwhen one volume of memory which was a certain person or a situation
p1392
aVif that goes away
p1393
aVit feels like life has come to an end
p1394
aVsimply because
p1395
aVa certain amount of investment youve made in a certain amount of memory you have about a specific person
p1396
aVso if you live by memory
p1397
aVim saying 2016 will leave you but you will not leave 2016
p1398
aVif you dont leave 2016
p1399
aVhow do you go to 2017
p1400
aVyou cannot
p1401
aVyou drag all these years and go into 2017
p1402
aVtheres no such thing
p1403
aVyou will be on a treadmill
p1404
aVyoull get the exercise but you wont go anywhere
p1405
aVtreadmill is fine if the weather is bad 
p1406
aVbut its not a vehicle to go somewhere
p1407
aVthis much you must understand
p1408
aVmemory is a treadmill
p1409
aVyes
p1410
aVmemory is a treadmill
p1411
aVit is all right to handle situations around us
p1412
aVbut youre not going to go anywhere with it
p1413
aVbut human beings have invested so much in their memory
p1414
aVtheres hardly a handful who will go with me on this one
p1415
aVtch
p1416
aVim asking
p1417
aVhow many of you really want to step into 2017
p1418
aVfully leaving 2016 behind
p1419
aV yeah yes
p1420
aV whoa whoa whoa 
p1421
aVif you really if really really im saying
p1422
aVif you can leave the past as past completely
p1423
aVif you can sit here just in the present
p1424
aVno past
p1425
aVyoure enlightened you know
p1426
aVthats all it takes
p1427
aVits the burden of the past
p1428
aVwhich doesnt let you flower into a full possibility
p1429
aVjust the burden of the past
p1430
aVso this is a good moment
p1431
aVthis is not something that the planet is doing okay
p1432
aVtch
p1433
aVyes the solstice has just happened
p1434
aVthat is there
p1435
aVbut every day planet is spinning
p1436
aVevery day it is moving
p1437
aVin the trajectory of the planetary movement around the sun
p1438
aVyou can choose any point to get enlightened
p1439
aVyou dont have to wait for this point 
p1440
aVyes or no
p1441
aVbut anyway we are at this point
p1442
aVwhere somewhere in your mind youve been told it is significant
p1443
aVits only significant because there is a memory of 2016
p1444
aVif there is no memory of 2016
p1445
aVin what way there is a 2017
p1446
aVthere is no such thing
p1447
aVno no this is
p1448
aVsadhguru youre confusing us 
p1449
aVsixteen
p1450
aVsixteen
p1451
aVseventeen 
p1452
aVits correct arithmetically correct
p1453
aVyes
p1454
aVbut only because there is memory
p1455
aVthere is sixteen and there is seventeen isnt it
p1456
aV yes
p1457
aV so if you know how to simply sit here
p1458
aVwithout being burdened by your memory
p1459
aVwithout being a product of memory
p1460
aVwhen i say product of memory 
p1461
aVyour likes
p1462
aVyour dislikes
p1463
aVwhom you love
p1464
aVwhom you dont love
p1465
aVwho is your friend
p1466
aVwho is your enemy
p1467
aVall this comes because of your memory isnt it
p1468
aVif you can keep all that aside
p1469
aVand let the new year blossom
p1470
aVyou will blossom into a wonderful creature
p1471
aVspraying fragrance into the world
p1472
aVwell
p1473
aVthere wont be any attendant music
p1474
aVnor will there be an applause
p1475
aVbut if really beautiful things happen who cares
p1476
aVwhether it is appreciated by somebody  or not 
p1477
aVhey
p1478
aVwhere is the attendant music
p1479
aVwhat happened to the musicians 
p1480
aVcome on
p1481
aVnothing so wonderful happened
p1482
aVso lets have some music 
p1483
aVwhat
p1484
aV what is this
p1485
aVwhat did you say
p1486
aV isha home school
p1487
aV  i have no such mission
p1488
aVits for the parents to decide where they want to send their children
p1489
aVhmm
p1490
aV so what do you want to do with them eh 
p1491
aV oh youre thinking of starting a school here
p1492
aV yes yes
p1493

p2404
aS'its i am as war my teeth out '
p2405
aS'if you were conscious'
p2406
aS'on a particular day on brush as it is necessary for that day'
p2407
aS'thats how it should be'
p2408
aS'on a particular day'
p2409
aS'you would eat as it is in a city for the body '
p2410
aS'sleep as it is a necessity for the body'
p2411
aS'you will do everything consciously'
p2412
aS'but now its a habit'
p2413
aS'everything is a habit'
p2414
aS'what time you should go to bed'

aS'this is called slavberng'
p2420
aS'your doctor deals '
p2421
aS'all youuslamastertellsyouwhatyouthoneed to day'
p2422
aS'i dont see what the difference'
p2423
aS'was it the children or not'
p2424
aS'his body needs to day'
p2425
aS'because no consciousness'
p2426
aS'everything by regimentation '
p2427
aS'by habit '
p2428
aS'habit is it a dementationissint '
p2429
aS'its only by a dementation you become havitu'
p2430
aS'so in this for you are also identified something as good'
p2431
aS'it on something as bad habit'
p2432
aS'or to do '
p2433
aS'he is there something all as bad unconsciousness'
p2434
aS'and good and consciousness'
p2435
aS'thats what you sing '
p2436
aS'when you say i have a good have it'
p2437
aS'youre saying i am unconscious in a nice way'
p2438
aS'lest lakesigente saying'
p2439
aS'i am dead in a nice way '
p2440
aS'because the fundamental difference'
p2441
aS'in being alive and being dead is'
p2442
aS'being conscious and being toy and conscious'
p2443
aS'being partially unconscious is being partially dead'
p2444
aS'as a ilorytolyou'
p2445
aS'you ll trying to practise the poshinchu'
p2446
aS'and the state of what it means to be dead '
p2447
aS'do not tricks any kind of habit'
p2448
aS'to see '
p2449
aS'to the idea of bedrowing into eceets'
p2450
aS'coming to his birds and space is just this'
p2451
aS'you find space who had you can do everything consciously'
p2452
aS'enyouwurdinarace'
p2453
aS'you could not be conscious'
p2454
aS'to go mad'
p2455
aS'or somehow fix some habits'
p2456
aS'through which you managed to wodreofdailyofficeroping'
p2457
aS'when you come to a pitatoupace'
p2458
aS'is is what youre supposed to do '
p2459
aS'that you watch what is the equipment of your body'
p2460
aS'what is the requirement of your mind'
p2461
aS'what is the equarment of her emotion'
p2462
aS'what is the requirement of her energy'
p2463
aS'or does his life need'
p2464
aS'it does it naturally long for me '
p2465
aS'to consciously whats this'
p2466
aS'once you consciously know that this is what it is longing for'
p2467
aS'then that is not always about it'
p2468
aS'otherwise you think you are of this villagtofbatebecause '
p2469
aS'me thats a crime against me'
p2470
ag1664
aS'if youre unconscious is a claim against yourself '
p2471
aS'but you are doing something that you think is ilritul'
p2472
aS'because of me'
p2473
aS'thats a climagansme'
p2474
ag1664
aS'to claim against yourself not against me'
p2475
aS'so how do i i of habit'
p2476
aS'you dont have to get rid of habits it '
p2477
aS'like '
p2478
aS'what you are asking is'
p2479
aS'how do i get rid of my unconsciousness'
p2480
aS'you used the word on'
p2481
aS'he is sudisting anon exist '
p2482
aS'not in existence is in '
p2483
aS'consciousness ease'
p2484
aS'when consciousness is not there '
p2485
aS'that is all unconsciousness'
p2486
aS'how to get id of something that does not existion '
p2487
aS'i am saying you playing a trick with you see'
p2488
aS'its like '
p2489
aS'so this this all is dark '
p2490
aS'how to get rid of this dog is '
p2491
aS'i do '
p2492
ag1664
aS'all of you to me that i am sure you ban ki of the darkness'
p2493
aS'you get in to a an insane effort '
p2494
aS'one'
p2495
ag1664
aS'this insane effort to get rid of unconsciousness'
p2496
aS'no'
p2497
aS'to richard of darkness you just have to lighted up '
p2498
aS'i should like it up '
p2499
aS'ducnesses gone'
p2500
aS'because darkness is not in existence by itself '
p2501
aS'just the absence of light '
p2502
aS'similarly unconsciousness is not an existence of itself '
p2503
aS'it is just absence of consciousness'
p2504
aS'if you become conscious'
p2505
aS'do you have to fight with unconscious'
p2506
ag1664
aS'if you are conscious'
p2507
aS'you have to fight with unconscious habits'
p2508
ag1664
aS'so you need to work unconsciousness to become conscious'
p2509
aS'or what should i do '
p2510
aS'you should not go unconscious things '
p2511
aS'because the sense of life is being conscious'
p2512
aS'you know that you are alive only because your reasonably conscious desenten'
p2513
aS'yes so '
p2514
aS'yes'
p2515
aS'yophastislep'
p2516
aS'do you know your dad or eli '
p2517
aS'do you know '
p2518
ag1664
ag1664
aS'why because youre not conscious'
p2519
aS'when not conscious'
p2520
aS'do not even know whether you get at alive ascent it'
p2521
aS'now you know that your relive'
p2522
aS'because you are somewhat conscious'
p2523
aS'now we just have to grease the wick a little bit to become more conscious'
p2524
aS'thats what we working off '
p2525
aS'there are many things which has gathered in use '
p2526
aS'to a physicavody thats why'
p2527
aS'five thirty drum in the morning'
p2528
aS'our mind has got into it on habityourdpacens'
p2529
aS'thats why i mean to telling you with all this'
p2530
aS'oudenidies have followed the equerementofboy'
p2531
aS'mine they go into their own pagans'
p2532
aS'that divide the side '
p2533
aS'the idea is to break the sales of unconsciousness and become conscious'
p2534
aS'when you become conscious'
p2535
aS'it looks like youre in unknown tellan'
p2536
aS'suddenly everything seems to be difficult'
p2537
aS'when you are going habitolytolooklike everything was easy but'
p2538
aS'see when i'
p2539
aS'when i went into the qlimatourpristan'
p2540
ag1664
aS'and then inquarnford'
p2541
aS'when i went there to conduct to prove '
p2542
aS'a most twenty five twenty four twenty five years ago '
p2543
aS'i just obsoved'
p2544
aS'this is something the whole lot of people are seeking in their life '
p2545
aS'presently'
p2546
aS'because this is a place who had somebody always open to door '
p2547
aS'and the close a '
p2548
aS'the tone of the light for you'
p2549
aS'they do everything for you '
p2550
aS'everdoanytreally'
p2551
aS'for the comes a ban on time all '
p2552
aS'by the second amdelingof'
p2553
aS'onmendfotereryg '
p2554
aS'think its great in this prison i '
p2555
aS'get place '
p2556
aS'thing is its an force '
p2557
aS'this is or a whole lot of people of seeking sister'
p2558
aS'in that lie '
p2559
ag1664
aS'when it is done to you you and hefelitdontelingu '
p2560
aS'when it is when it is done to you you will suffer it '
p2561
aS'to leave but a whole lot of people'
p2562
aS'prison life he is far more'
p2563
aS'it is far more othenisonwhattheycleam off in their life'
p2564
aS'its for more efficient'
p2565
aS'fomornotoshies'
p2566
aS'and most of them are very fricenheal '
p2567
aS'but if you enter the prison'
p2568
aS'he is suffering in the air'
p2569
aS'not ones have been their ehundeds of times a wariouspresens'
p2570
aS'not one i stepped out of the prison without tears in my eyes because'
p2571
aS'there is suffering in the air the pan'
p2572
aS'in the air is unbearable'
p2573
aS'because one thing that a human being suffers most his lack of freedom'
p2574
aS'not lack of comfort'
p2575
aS'not lack of well '
p2576
aS'not lack of this and that'
p2577
aS'once freedom is taken away '
p2578
aS'man being suffers immensely '
p2579
aS'everything is gone '
p2580
aS'prison life is far more comfortable than going to work and coming back '
p2581
aS'i stuck in the craig '
p2582
aS'going to all this problems'
p2583
aS'you are a tame guest and '
p2584
aS'really'
p2585
aS'if youre looking for the comfortable'
p2586
aS'no surprises kind of life '
p2587
aS'if you suffer every little thing'
p2588
aS'every thing shocks you '
p2589
aS'thing makes you got a stress intention'
p2590
aS'an life is perfect '
p2591
aS'thing is in order '
p2592
aS'rises'
p2593
aS'everything is just dry '
p2594
aS'the mans '
p2595
aS'nextsepenieswatcsthemanu'
p2596
aS'there i posed by that'
p2597
aS'in more nothing more nothing less'
p2598
aS'one being more means somebody will be taken to gas '
p2599
aS'thing is correct'
p2600
aS'does who are looking for the cia lie '
p2601
aS'prison is the best place'
p2602
aS'but a human being with suffered immensely in everything is connect'
p2603
aS'yes ted '
p2604
ag1664
aS'thing is correct but no frieda'
p2605
aS'people with suffered this immensely'
p2606
aS'so you need to understand '
p2607
aS'habit means you have caused a little prison of your own'
p2608
aS'and you and suffered the eftersuntime'
p2609
aS'initially looks like efficiency'
p2610
aS'after some time'
p2611
aS'it is impresentmenti'
p2612
aS'prison is in many is an epitomofveficciencyliit'
p2613
aS'but eficienceiis not what this life is looking for this'
p2614
aS'life is looking for expansion this'
p2615
aS'life want the freedom to expand always'
p2616
aS'i was talking to one of this management species from america'
p2617
aS'a very well on man '
p2618
aS'not mention the names'
p2619
aS'so he was spruboundingalnhismanagementprincipl'
p2620
aS'of'
p2621
aS'which look like a prison cell to me'
p2622
aS'bring in order to everything '
p2623
aS'lusufficien'
p2624
aS'so that the two ways of looking at this '
p2625
aS'that is a manicoregarden which looks very parent'
p2626
aS'is forest which looks like hes'
p2627
aS'but the manicagode'
p2628
aS'if you dont manage it for one man its finished'
p2629
aS'a nogatelefe'
p2630
aS'forest has managed itself for a milliners and'
p2631
aS'in going on '
p2632
aS'it is more efficient'
p2633
aS'which is more orderedly'
p2634
aS'oh '
p2635
aS'fortestisformoreadily and far more efficient'
p2636
aS'but it is not fitting in to your logical framework that a'
p2637
aS'this is what enlightenment means'
p2638
aS'that from being a menicorgoden'
p2639
aS'you became a forest because'
p2640
aS'it sustains upon its house'
p2641
aS'it doesnt need anything from outside'
p2642
aS'in it to what of it'
p2643
aS'nobody need to men '
p2644
aS'it nobody need to come and cement'
p2645
aS'everything happens within a tale'
p2646
aS'is it'
p2647
ag1664
aS'if you live in for a million years it will still be there'
p2648
aS'only if you meddle with it it may go away'
p2649
aS'o the wise it in sustain its half because it is an efficiency of cash'
p2650
aS'recall something ceos not because it is an efficient'
p2651
aS'we call something cross because it doesnt fit into our logical framework'
p2652
aS'a habit means you have become a slave of your own logic'
p2653
aS'and after some time'
p2654
aS'the moment you fall my habit'
p2655
aS'it is unconscious assent '
p2656
aS'so what you need to get it off is not habits'
p2657
aS'you have to become conscious'
p2658
aS'if you become more conscious and you are not unconscious'
p2659
aS'there is no such thing as habit'
p2660
aS'you will do what it to you now '

p4115
aS'everything is just right'
p4116
aS'in the menu is written'
p4117
aS"next seven days what's the menu"

p4124
aS'that i him in being will suffer immensely when everything is correct'
p4125
aS'yes sir no'
p4126
ag3174
aS'everything is correct but no freedom'
p4127
aS'people will suffer this immensely'
p4128
aS'so you need to understand'
p4129
aS'have bit means you have cost little prison of your own'
p4130
aS'and you will say for this have to sometime'
p4131
aS'initially looks like efficiency'
p4132
aS'after some time'
p4133
aS'it is'
p4134
aS'cursion is in many ways and happy home of efficiency is that'
p4135
aS'but efficiency is not what this life is looking for this'
p4136
aS'life is looking for expansion this'
p4137
aS'life wants the freedom to expand all wise'
p4138
aS'i was talking to one of this management specialist from my'
p4139
aS'so where a well known man'
p4140
aS'they not mention the name'
p4141
aS'so he will providing all his management principle'
p4142
aS'which of'
p4143
aS'which look like a presence help to main'
p4144
aS'bringing order to everything so'
p4145
aS'but sufficient'
p4146
aS'see there are two ways of looking at this'
p4147
aS'there is a manicure garden which looks very perfect'
p4148
aS'r is forest which looks like yours'
p4149
aS'but the many cute guard'
p4150
aS"if you don't manage it for one month its finished"
p4151
aS'there is no garden left'
p4152
aS'forrest has managed itself for a mill in years and'
p4153
aS'still going on'
p4154
aS'which is more efficient'
p4155
aS'which is more'
p4156
ag1664
aS'forrest is far more arderly and for more efficient'
p4157
aS'that it is not fitting into your logical framework thats all'
p4158
aS'this is what enlightenment mix'
p4159
aS'that from being a manager'
p4160
aS'you become a forest because'
p4161
aS'its stands upon its'
p4162
aS"it doesn't need anything from outside"
p4163
aS'nobody need to water it'
p4164
aS'nobody need to man'
p4165
aS'all right nobody you need to come and'
p4166
aS'everything happens within its half'
p4167
ag1664
aS'the'
p4168
aS'if you leave it for a million years it is still be there'
p4169
aS'only if you medal with it s me go'
p4170
aS'otherwise it will sustain its half because it is an efficiency of cross'
p4171
aS'we call something cures not because it is an efficient'
p4172
aS"we call something cares because it doesn't fit into our logical framework"
p4173
aS'so have it means you have become a slave of your own logic'
p4174
aS'and after some time'
p4175
aS'the moment you form have it'
p4176
aS'it is unconscious'
p4177
aS'so what you need to get rid of is not'
p4178
aS'you have to become conscious'
p4179
aS'if you become more conscious and you are not'
p4180
aS'then there is no such thing as have it'
