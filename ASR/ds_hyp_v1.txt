most beautiful thing about time is i should do something it passes by  they should do nothing it passes by  i so joyful it passes by  i so miserable it passes why  its absolutely get no matter who you

time is passing my made slowly  if you were in tents im just flash why  reality time is happening to all of us if the same base the sales of time  he then its minutes or hours our days in months or years that go by the sales of time  anything that pycookol is naturally levidtotiv  anything that dicictacal  so it has a sentihuge or ascentituvefore a force which is always sing to go away and attendant from the sable  if you rivedngtdissentrthieen force of time  we say your bite  if your cat at in the sale of time then thats being material if you crushed by the cargoes of time then may say or a suffering creature it is the same psycho either you can be crushed by the sago  all you can be trapped in the cycle all you can ride the cycle  to ride the ciconse of time  not to be craved a it  definitely not to be crushed by it  time is a crushing experience for a lot of people   anything psychical has this ability that it can crush you  or it can trap  or you can grab it and the yoga were looking at things wee time  time is efintoiscolor a be means both time and space calominsdoness dogness means that which does not stop like  a top no  if that is light going by you wont see  only if

as two different entities only because there is time  space as possible  because that is time you can move from pontyeopinebe she is space  there was no time  no i  the general perception is that because there is space that is time  but i dont see that way because there is time that is space no  that is time  which happens because of sao the blanetpensancsit'saday the moon goes around the flat

she had no not   the ansewas cursing and wondering and miserable what the hell to do now  and she was a little more  because he was hearing all kinds of noises from a mandolin  on which was across the

however you do live still do it better  is  but did happen so per efficiently for everybody youll condemebrovonelant  gotinggoocanimproen  you dont have to practice your final porschanright now  if i come naturally believe me  its not like i the no difficulty that i  come ready naturally you will perfectly well in the grate  dont have to have any dow doesnt need any preparation  when you die when you get it  uh but now with life there is so much to do and all how much ever you do  theres something more to do a bit like isnt  if you want to be at it fundamental ambionceestthatyouejoyfom  there you will give this tremendously intelligent i do a question to be or not to be  its indelictarly seems to any profound  but its a mutiyothequstion you'ldonahavetodeshidenotto  it will happen  there were many idiots like you countless number of indians like you on this planet or gone  they dont have to worry about to be or not to be known anyway they are not to me  this is an hour time on this planet  hi   as our time on this planet what are we going to do  i  are we going to make this into a neil  full ndefulplanet are going to make this edoovisitable horribuplanint this is our time  a to do either way the choice is yours  i tell you  resolution that you would make this into wonderful planet  is no such thing the natural inclination of life is a pleasantness if you choose to be qeryglessentwithhen yourself pleasant things will happen  if you are feeling horrible within you you tried to do wonderful things then i want to tindesstand the worst tyrants on the planet those who pop the bays historically  i think of the worst of the lot  the somebody like adatredlas on benintomoselininthe i really believe the going to queen to one of fuel world  no  they had to dream of an ideal world  when a audible things going within you and you go or the world with very anegytill what you will create is a horindosrealiy before you touch the wild  if you want to clean somebodys face you are a hand must be clean is he  o sir   and are not clean  ed that this is not going to work  so before the fec the outside world this much you must do to with your house that to you are glad  and you are pleasant have you to will become pleasant you are unpleasant  but you have good intentions it is no good i wanted on this pen right now in the world one situation that is happening in certenparts of the world which almost everybody in the world  is the most horrible things that can happen they believe they are creating gods own kingdom the one yet the  ounedvescentbelievfyouma question though intelligence you cannot question the integrity as the wilingodiforit when a man is willing to die for something you cannot question his integrity is it  you can cushtionisintelligenttoandetiment but you cannot question his integrity because when i take my life you must know i mean it isnt it i am not laingfolwithit it made small to me than my life  certainly yeah  i wonder to now you have anger and hated going with a new but you want to create a wonderful world what happens the consequence of that is a horrindisrialitythesnop tension that the world we change it is by your consciousness that the word with chain how you are within yourself  if we dont fix this one thing  we will have intention and intentions the worst things how happen on the planet with good intentions bad intentions is it the most oandistincts how happen with very good indenious so what intention you have is not important what is your aneature this is important every action the human beings at doing in their life noinglyarunnoingly pusudoftherwolbeng  and you know you feel well only when your joyful  hello yes you i really well only when your happy and doyfulresante on in other words  a single action that human beings before is in pursued of the happiness of joy  if they were joyful by that on nature  every action that you perform would become cons in of being compulsive present  this is all you have to do to yourself  this year the coming year and the coming coming here and for the rest of you like you just have to keep accounts so at to day a

yourself is littlngtools to make sure that you dont sing kipingourconts hell every day before you go to bed  check whether youre living more joyful to day and estorday okay if you keep this up the time your turn  extent  when i was when i was just twenty five  i simply sat down with my close every seen my body was dipping extasy namlessetecis then i realised this is it nothing to be done if you dont mess with your mind our extent a  the fool that i was i made a plan  to and a half to three years time i am going to make the entire world extra  because theres nothing to do i yousimplycinteyoukno hi dyvivyers  have not lost it  a few people have governing  yes quite a four people have got men but still not the world  making some estimates  i anavrede in the last three as

looks like in this time to die a halo but i liealisfulfail i use may be blissful is not dependent upon the reo of my actions my act a rude in mablessulness this is how life needs to be connected that your actions are rooted in your joyfulness and wistfulness that joy is not a result of something that you do the moment i isevisildof something that you do  it reflyawayinnoclams us our actions in the world  not always of the successful  how old well you do you the son however well you do it  not always of a successful our actions so subject to waiousrealiti many forces have to come together for the success of any action not always live all together  so if you joy if your way of being is enslaved to the success of your activity then you being joyful is a very the more possibility and over all i happenings  then you perform action if they dont succeed  sure going to become miserable to a couple of bunce i will sing  you and see how to restsecyore life to minimal activity so to do  enjoy maximum success if you coldpelyorsalafhonno if you crippleyourself you can put dissipate in a race with people so  you have only one leg  then you participate in a race with somebody who does not have

that you can go through your faioublissfully you will do everything that you can do who gives where that happens had not  wewilloidtenmildoitdwell  if it happens its great if it doesnt happen its very

imminsetyforgivingatthisoppersiptidrussoneqishdon  huwdoygengridervin some unconscious bad habit of my life  when he see that i have overcome some of those bad habits  see that it comes back again in my life  had waiters tordlygetrid of this and becomfreo  that a mustendestandandtois there is no such thing as good habit and bad habit habitarbaner habit mean you are unconscious you think only bad headwitterundquantceus no  even the socalled good habits it means you have learned to function in unoromatewiy in you do i do things consciously o exam  these brushing you teeth in the morning or good habit or a bad habit even you i thought you would be free from the habit  i had two ways of rushing your teeth  cause you been regimented and to brusotee you get up and  are because you wake up you are vearysenidiv if you open your mouth conscious enough most of the time  not conscious in of only  people know this away strange thing  it is the aparicos the old factory averytis which smell which have a sense of smell a right  about you mount but you dont get it or the  getieivriedewin  that mentouteunconsciencicent is  if youre gone this you would still brushyourtep till you come to such a place when you open your mouth in the morning  molsslikefragantwtobecomelike a flower to happens you must justly brush if youre consciously brush on different they or different mornings it mayieddivferentlengh or different a man to brissin not every day rushing is same requedment but because your regimented its i am as war my teeth out  if you were conscious on a particular day on brush as it is necessary for that day thats how it should be on a particular day you would eat as it is in a city for the body  sleep as it is a necessity for the body you will do everything consciously but now its a habit everything is a habit what time you should go to bed a time you shall wake up  you shall be toward you nor eat everything my prescription  this is called slavberng your doctor deals  all youuslamastertellsyouwhatyouthoneed to day i dont see what the difference was it the children or not his body needs to day because no consciousness everything by regimentation  by habit  habit is it a dementationissint  its only by a dementation you become havitu so in this for you are also identified something as good it on something as bad habit or to do  he is there something all as bad unconsciousness and good and consciousness thats what you sing  when you say i have a good have it youre saying i am unconscious in a nice way lest lakesigente saying i am dead in a nice way  because the fundamental difference in being alive and being dead is being conscious and being toy and conscious being partially unconscious is being partially dead as a ilorytolyou you ll trying to practise the poshinchu and the state of what it means to be dead  do not tricks any kind of habit to see  to the idea of bedrowing into eceets coming to his birds and space is just this you find space who had you can do everything consciously enyouwurdinarace you could not be conscious to go mad or somehow fix some habits through which you managed to wodreofdailyofficeroping when you come to a pitatoupace is is what youre supposed to do  that you watch what is the equipment of your body what is the requirement of your mind what is the equarment of her emotion what is the requirement of her energy or does his life need it does it naturally long for me  to consciously whats this once you consciously know that this is what it is longing for then that is not always about it otherwise you think you are of this villagtofbatebecause  me thats a crime against me  if youre unconscious is a claim against yourself  but you are doing something that you think is ilritul because of me thats a climagansme  to claim against yourself not against me so how do i i of habit you dont have to get rid of habits it  like  what you are asking is how do i get rid of my unconsciousness you used the word on he is sudisting anon exist  not in existence is in  consciousness ease when consciousness is not there  that is all unconsciousness how to get id of something that does not existion  i am saying you playing a trick with you see its like  so this this all is dark  how to get rid of this dog is  i do   all of you to me that i am sure you ban ki of the darkness you get in to a an insane effort  one  this insane effort to get rid of unconsciousness no to richard of darkness you just have to lighted up  i should like it up  ducnesses gone because darkness is not in existence by itself  just the absence of light  similarly unconsciousness is not an existence of itself  it is just absence of consciousness if you become conscious do you have to fight with unconscious  if you are conscious you have to fight with unconscious habits  so you need to work unconsciousness to become conscious or what should i do  you should not go unconscious things  because the sense of life is being conscious you know that you are alive only because your reasonably conscious desenten yes so  yes yophastislep do you know your dad or eli  do you know    why because youre not conscious when not conscious do not even know whether you get at alive ascent it now you know that your relive because you are somewhat conscious now we just have to grease the wick a little bit to become more conscious thats what we working off  there are many things which has gathered in use  to a physicavody thats why five thirty drum in the morning our mind has got into it on habityourdpacens thats why i mean to telling you with all this oudenidies have followed the equerementofboy mine they go into their own pagans that divide the side  the idea is to break the sales of unconsciousness and become conscious when you become conscious it looks like youre in unknown tellan suddenly everything seems to be difficult when you are going habitolytolooklike everything was easy but see when i when i went into the qlimatourpristan  and then inquarnford when i went there to conduct to prove  a most twenty five twenty four twenty five years ago  i just obsoved this is something the whole lot of people are seeking in their life  presently because this is a place who had somebody always open to door  and the close a  the tone of the light for you they do everything for you  everdoanytreally for the comes a ban on time all  by the second amdelingof onmendfotereryg  think its great in this prison i  get place  thing is its an force  this is or a whole lot of people of seeking sister in that lie   when it is done to you you and hefelitdontelingu  when it is when it is done to you you will suffer it  to leave but a whole lot of people prison life he is far more it is far more othenisonwhattheycleam off in their life its for more efficient fomornotoshies and most of them are very fricenheal  but if you enter the prison he is suffering in the air not ones have been their ehundeds of times a wariouspresens not one i stepped out of the prison without tears in my eyes because there is suffering in the air the pan in the air is unbearable because one thing that a human being suffers most his lack of freedom not lack of comfort not lack of well  not lack of this and that once freedom is taken away  man being suffers immensely  everything is gone  prison life is far more comfortable than going to work and coming back  i stuck in the craig  going to all this problems you are a tame guest and  really if youre looking for the comfortable no surprises kind of life  if you suffer every little thing every thing shocks you  thing makes you got a stress intention an life is perfect  thing is in order  rises everything is just dry  the mans  nextsepenieswatcsthemanu there i posed by that in more nothing more nothing less one being more means somebody will be taken to gas  thing is correct does who are looking for the cia lie  prison is the best place but a human being with suffered immensely in everything is connect yes ted   thing is correct but no frieda people with suffered this immensely so you need to understand  habit means you have caused a little prison of your own and you and suffered the eftersuntime initially looks like efficiency after some time it is impresentmenti prison is in many is an epitomofveficciencyliit but eficienceiis not what this life is looking for this life is looking for expansion this life want the freedom to expand always i was talking to one of this management species from america a very well on man  not mention the names so he was spruboundingalnhismanagementprincipl of which look like a prison cell to me bring in order to everything  lusufficien so that the two ways of looking at this  that is a manicoregarden which looks very parent is forest which looks like hes but the manicagode if you dont manage it for one man its finished a nogatelefe forest has managed itself for a milliners and in going on  it is more efficient which is more orderedly oh  fortestisformoreadily and far more efficient but it is not fitting in to your logical framework that a this is what enlightenment means that from being a menicorgoden you became a forest because it sustains upon its house it doesnt need anything from outside in it to what of it nobody need to men  it nobody need to come and cement everything happens within a tale is it  if you live in for a million years it will still be there only if you meddle with it it may go away o the wise it in sustain its half because it is an efficiency of cash recall something ceos not because it is an efficient we call something cross because it doesnt fit into our logical framework a habit means you have become a slave of your own logic and after some time the moment you fall my habit it is unconscious assent  so what you need to get it off is not habits you have to become conscious if you become more conscious and you are not unconscious there is no such thing as habit you will do what it to you now  so nine hundred ninety nine question leastliverdthatoortrindisantien all the rest so  i thourgeniti i have a wessonnanregardingthewolg and am i wanted to know and like if

need to sit in one place and do it  it is a fadifiennatiuren it is it is a process is can change to tape  the chemistry of your system many of you have experienced this after a few months of practice if you look back and see all those little althangsfith were so significant dont seem to bother you any  it is gone simply because the chemistry has changed on know when camemistrychangesthinks change  in order but where you have one  but there are other that mentions to human chenestry that instead of being olotilereactivecamistry become avedyselfcontiined emistry which is pleasant and on  practices in the book or not  sitting down under in practices you could be doing it anywhere i could be driving  you could be working in your office you  walking on the street and to be doing it there  nature  in other words the practices in the book or just to bring a suit in amount of consciousness the or did not have this practices to start with but when i traveled around in america  i was talking about being mindful then i saw  being mind for what they will do to themselves and to work is to bring you to a certain sense of abandon that you can be here like your not here  if ye site  you dont even know whether your bodies  if you sit like this first thing is you dont have a gene you  ebodysovetysa  a gem  if you simply sit like this that is not time for you  look of this only because you have a body you bodiskeepingtime  le of telling you how long you been sitting  no i i   i you had no legs you would have no sense of time if you no bank no sense of time at all if he had

what the famyurligsno hi  bookaboprekise so the program practices are of a different nature that cannot be transmitted unless a certain amount of preparation and its a transmission is not teaching bob is a teaching  vagdifferencebetweenteaching and transmission do not mitmisunderstandbotas one  this is a we afcleading a smaller step for people  people are not willing to take one big step small step they lead the moan if some small to changed them take the program  but there is no substitute for sitting properly with us  and doing what is being done properly and not only that it is no substitute for a tensmision if something is not transtmated the new will happen mproment of the present will happen nothing now will have  which chambbiwiaenotlooking at him growing you we want something new to spain  something that was never there with you till that moment must happen within you  and in the  is trying to tickirlydesist existing wherever you are right now to make a little improvent most

anything  this one you can address only with consciousness there is no other way  if you wont have this one you have assembly of things eeletmender something where the enstitivwiwantedo listen to this carefully other ways you will come to wrong conclusions let  somebody who the tea to die and they go away for some bra  you feel like you lost everything i had no you we like you lost everything
