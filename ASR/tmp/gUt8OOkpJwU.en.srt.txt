 sadhguru welcome to yale  thank you   what a delight what a joy to have you here you are among friends and it seems  that there are many who know of your work and there are many who dont  you are a highly educated man and im but im devoid of education so you have to   well you know as  make some allowances for me  thats lovely of you to say i was so well educated i have rediscovered a joyful curiosity and while it is true i have many degrees after my name as ive lost my hair and become more wrinkly  ive so enjoyed the spirit of joyful curiosity so in the spirit of hospitality in the spirit of joyful curiosity and coming together across traditions i would love to hear your thoughts on a number of topics the one that is near and dear to my heart as an educator and as a physician and a pastor is this area of wellness and burnout physicians today a big study came out  fiftyfour percent of physicians in america meet criteria for burnout and nurses are in the same boat and youre here at a medical school and were looking for answers and were looking for hope and so to those fiftyfour percent of physicians who are burned out and the nurses and pas and nurse practitioners all of us in healthcare what would you say to them  if we have to bring health either to ourselves or to others one fundamental thing is you bring a very profound sense of wholeness into you  the various dimensions of life that we are all of it is in sync and functioning well its sad to hear that physicians are in a state of burnout how would they cause health they could sell more medicine but they cannot cause health if they are in a state of burnout now were seeing as modern medicine progresses comes out with miracle after miracle research all kinds of things but people are not getting healthy more people are getting sick than ever before a country like united states which is the most affluent country on the planet which essentially means you have a choice of nourishments every human being has a choice of nourishment most of the ailment that you see in other parts of the world are nourishment related in some way because the needed nourishment is not there at the right time for a whole lot of people on this planet but in a country where there is a choice of nourishment  i would say an excessive choice of nourishment  a nation is spending three trillion dollars on healthcare this is bigger than the budgets of major nations in the world indias economy is around three trillion dollars youre spending that much on healthcare of a quartermillion people this shows somewhere we have missed health maybe we have an industry going but we have missed health well we can explain it in so many ways but doctors being under burnout everybody thinks their profession is the most difficult one if if any individual human being is creating something that they really care for there would be never any kind of burnout myself and a whole lot of people around me we are seven days of the week twenty hours a day threehundredandsixtyfive days thiss our schedule you will not see me burned out maybe sometimes ill get physically exhausted maybe ill die of exhaustion one day but definitely not of burnout or boredom those two things will never happen to me why im saying this is the fundamental reason why this is happening is  particularly the physicians because therere various kinds of professions but particularly when people go to a doctor in some way theyre placing their life in his hands so when somebody is willing to place their life in your hands you must treat it as a sacred duty its not just a job its not just a business it is a when somebody is willing to place their life in your hands im telling you even people who live with you your own wife and children or husband is not willing to place their life in your hands completely  but somebody an unknown person comes and places his life in your hands i think its a greatest privilege that somebody trusts you at that level that theyre willing to trust you with life you could do right things or wrong things knowingly or unknowingly because nobody has figured the human body absolutely all right we know it to some extent so you may do any number of wrong things but they placed their life into your hands i think traditionally it was said like this in india in any given society if education medicine and spiritual process if it gets commercialized that society will go down the drain i think were doing this to the entire modern world all three are becoming commercialized theres nothing wrong with commerce commerce is a a transaction of give and take you give me this ill give you that but there are some things which cannot be handled as just give and take if you bring this aspect of transaction into spiritual process into education and into medicine then it turns ugly and that ugliness will definitely burn you out one way or the other above all what people are experiencing as burnout is  first of all theyre doing something that they dont care for if they were genuinely doing something that they truly care for there would be no burnout the more opportunity you get to do it the better it would be isnt it everything is towards a certain end the joy of doing what youre doing is not there in ones life this is not just for any one profession its for all professions but particularly in a profession like this where its a question of life and death for somebody else when its a question of life and death for the person who is sitting in front of you it can't be a transaction for you well there is a business end to everything because to make anything sustainable there has to be a business end to it we are not against the business end of it but within yourself if you dont do it as a great offering to the person who is sitting in front of you  of course they will pay their fee but within yourself if you are not like this  definitely you will burnout doing this kind of work otherwise every day if you helped a person if in some way you made somebodys life their life better by the end of the day should you be ballooned into a joyful state or should be in a state of burnout at the end of the day it should not be a burnout if you genuinely experienced you have enhanced many lives around you this is not about service this is not about ideas of i served this i did this  no there is a joy within a human being when theyre able to touch another life why you are holding a few people dear to you as family is because you believe you can touch their life in some way you can make a difference that is what is most important for a human being in every activity that we perform whatever the nature of the activity how profoundly we can touch someone else this is what makes the big difference if you make a movie you dont want to make a movie which nobody wants to watch would you you want people to watch this movie and come to tears isnt it you dont want to build a house that nobody wants to live in you dont want to cook something that nobody wants to eat these things you can do only because in some way you are able to touch another life through your activity this is most fundamental need within the human being and as a physician you have a phenomenal opportunity of touching lives like very other very few other professions can do and this should not lead to burnout but this is happening so because were trying to treat it like a transaction and the most fundamental thing that we have not understood in this process is that human experience is caused from within not from outside your joy and misery your pain and pleasure your agony and ecstasy even light and darkness right now is happening only within you it never happens around you what happens within you if you try to fix it by fixing what is around you you will go bonkers in no time i am surprised why only fiftyfour percent  because if you dont understand human experience is caused from within especially medical professionals who in some way have delved into the nature of human physiology and i believe to some extent the mind we must know that every aspect of human experience comes from within and today modern medicine especially unlike the traditional medicine is entirely chemical fixes for everything so you understand that both health and illness is happening because of chemistry joy and misery is a certain chemistry different types of chemistry ecstasy and agony are different types of chemistry or in other words we are a chemical soup the question is only are you a great soup or a lousy soup  now if i give soupmaking ingredients to all of you do you believe all of you will come with the same kind of soup hmm you will come with hundred different varieties of soups so there is something called as the skill of soupmaking all of us have come with the same fundamental ingredients of life see in how many ways we have become and only fiftyfour percent are getting burnt out handling life so wrong hundred percent should be burnt out  so lets talk about making soup   so  no dont go into this area im a very good cook   okay well talk so this soup of life if you will so you know tonight there is a nurse or a physician who has come home and they told a family member that their loved one just died or they treated a child whos undergoing chemotherapy or they were in a clinic where theyre taking care of someone who doesnt have enough insurance to cover that medication and so those good folks have come home and their spirits are broken and they love what they do i think burnedout physicians love what they do  they do and i like that metaphor of soupmaking what can we do and so what can we do  what can that nurse that physician assistant that doc what saturday morning comes around they wake up what should they do  i i can teach you a way of making your chemistry into a blissful chemistry that means youre blissful by your own nature not because of something that happened around you this is exactly what im saying what this question implies is what happens around you determines what happens within you the significance of being human is this that what happens within me i can create around me if what happens around me makes me i am still in animal nature a human being means i do all the same things that the animal does but i can do all of it consciously that is the big part of being human well you are born like any other creature you grow up you eat you sleep maybe you reproduce and you die one day this is what every creature does this is what you and me do but we can do it consciously which includes your thought your emotion everything to put this very simply it amazes me that people are twenty thirty fifty sixty years of age they still do not know how to handle their thought and how to handle their emotion this is a huge disability in the world  if you dont know how to use your hands would you call that a disability if you dont know how to manage your thought how to manage your emotion is it not a disability just because everybody is in the same condition it does not become normal  so essentially you are you have made a choice of dealing with people who are sick or dying it is a choice and it is a privilege that those who are unwell  being unwell means you are no more hundred percent on your feet you need somebodys help  such people and those who are dying in some way theyre willing to trust you and put their life into your hands its a great privilege well in this there are many things to do as you gave examples that you have to convey something unpleasant to somebody sometimes you are not able to treat them because either you have no time or they have no money or whatever these are there im not questioning this but the most important aspect of this is if you want to bring wellbeing to somebody you must know how to be well isnt it otherwise how would you do it im asking how how would you create wellbeing to someone when you do not know how to be well what this implies is if i have to be well the world has to be perfect well youre not going to be well  because even if youre just two people in the family not everything happens the way you think it should happen isnt it hello you can tell me its okay  even if youre just two people not everything will ever happen to you hundred percent the way you want it fiftyone percent if its happening your way you have the controlling stake  anything more if you expect youll have a divorce  yes so outside will never happen hundred percent the way you want it or in other words if you expect the outside to be hundred percent the way you want it youre just not equipped to live here in this world yes or no if youre expecting the external situations to go hundred percent my way obviously im not equipped to live in this world you know we are a volunteer organization over 4000 fulltime volunteers over threemillion parttime volunteers every day somebody is coming up to me and saying sadhguru i cant take her anymore i can't take it this person i cant work with this person this man is like this this woman is like that i tell them see this is the kind of people that exist in the world if you think what youre doing is very significant youve got to work with these people however they are if you want to work with ideal people you must go to heaven and today  these are our realities if you truly see genuinely see that what im doing is significant its of significant its significant enough to make difference in lives around me now you have to do that work the problem is not of the nature of your work you just ask anybody from the topmost job down to the most menial job everybody complains about stress so stress is not about your job i must tell you this a few years ago many years ago when i first came to united states wherever i went people were talking about stress management i couldnt understand this because in my understanding we manage whatever is precious to us our family our wealth our business our money why would anybody want to manage stress  it took me a while to understand people have concluded that stress is a part of their life stress is not a part of your life its just your inability to manage your own thought your own emotion your own energies and your own body if you knew if your mind took instructions from you would you live in stress or in bliss please tell me  bliss  whats your choice yes such a simple thing is not happening because your mind is not even taking instructions from you if your intelligence turns against you who the hell can save you  so this anxiety this stress is not about the job it is just that our education systems are such they are telling you how to conquer the world you know how to break an invisible atom how to go beyond space but theyre not telling you a thing about this one  this  is the most complex  if you want to call it a human mechanism  this  is the most complex and sophisticated mechanism you have seen yes  yes  as a doctor you know but im asking even the doctors have they read the users manual  how to use this  no just by accident something when you live by accident anxiety is natural  so i was really interested in the title of your book  inner engineering   a yogis guide to joy and those are some words that you dont usually see often so close together im thinking about engineering  and joy   and joy  and a yogi and a yogi   and a yogi right engineering yogi you know and i like that word engineering you need to know there are some really some of the top engineers at the university are in the audience tonight  yesterday was the engineers  theyre right there  yesterday was the world engineers day   yeah so whats the whats the theme of what would you say is the message of this i mean i think youre getting at that inner engineering   a yogis guide to joy what does that mean  see if you if you and me were here lets say a hundred years ago or two hundred years ago how the world was and how it is today it is almost another world its not the same world you wouldnt have recognized it thats how much it has changed what changed this our ability to engineer external situations the way we want it we could sit outside and do this but now were sitting in this building because this is engineered for our comfort now engineering essentially means making something just the way we want it we made everything in the world the way we want it but now fiftyfour percent burnout  because we did not make this one thing  the way we want it if we made this one thing  the way we want it again the same question  would you live blissfully or miserably if you made this  the way you want it you would definitely make this blissful highest level of pleasantness for yourself what you want for your neighbor may be debatable  but what you want for yourself is very clear isnt it so this is not happening because we have never approached inner wellbeing in a scientific manner we are thinking something else from somewhere is going to fix this if we want to be well we looked up in india they call this uparwala that means the one above im saying is it true that you are living on a round planet hello is it a round planet that we are living on  and on top of it its spinning if you look up youre invariably looking up in the wrong direction isnt it  im  you must go to australia  to look up the right way so im saying we are simply even incapable of knowing what is up and down in this universe is it somewhere marked in this cosmos  this side up  we not only do not know we cannot know isnt it so we dont even know which is up which is down we do not know what is forward what is backward we really do not know what is east what is west for convenience we made up things but there is one thing that you can know right now there is a perspective there is inward and there is outward we have been just busy fixing the outside you fix the outside as much as you want all you will get is comfort and convenience you will not get wellbeing if wellbeing has to happen you have to engineer your interiority the way you want it only when this  becomes the way you want now this will be joyful if outside becomes the way i want there will be comfort you have to admit this  never before in the history of humanity any other generation knew the kind of comforts and convenience that you and me are enjoying right now yes or no hmm  yes  we are the most comfortable generation ever but we are whining like crazy   lets talk about the inner life and the outer life one thing that strikes me as so powerful about your mission in the world is that you seem to successfully broker both of those worlds  oh bro you must take off the word broker   i guess how to say you successfully pursue both of those worlds if you will the isha foundation educates the young and plants trees and then you also teach people about inner engineering and i think that could be a challenge for we in the west we in the west perhaps love the outer world and maybe at the expense of the inner world but id love to hear your perspective on that  see all these massive projects of health education and ecology that were doing in southern india have mainly happened only because of an inner experience therere millions of people who had a powerful inner experience its out of that we are able to generate this action because these massive projects are all completely done by a volunteer force volunteers means  nobodys trained for the job  and  and you cannot fire them for inefficiency  because theyre volunteers  at the same time even if theyre holding a key position at any time without notice they can just vanish  you manage an organization like this you will go crazy in no time thats my job  so  having described my job which is a sure route to madness  if i was not as well established as i am within myself it would have driven me bonkers because ive managed businesses before and at that time i used to wield my authority on people to get things going and the main thing was they were on my you know i was doing the payment for them that was the main control now i dont make any payment for anybody everybody is not paid nobody is paid in fact they spend their own money and come and do everything to keep them going is essentially the inner engineering because there is a powerful experience within which drives them to do all this work it is it is unfortunate that people always trying to divide the world you must understand this that the very basic nature of human intellect is this human intellect  you know all of you  the sharper it is the better it is isnt it so you should agree with me  the sharper it is the better it is i think intellect  i actually wanna talk about being a prophet  hey dont go that far lets finish the project   lets go there so because one of the things about sort of be mindful of the inner life  mhmm  you cannot be mindful of the inner life now you talked about being a prophet now i can say no   so i don't think i wouldnt say youre a prophet im talking about the judeochristian tradition of prophecy  oh  so in the hebrew bible in the old testament there is the role of those who speak truth to power who speak out against injustice who sacrifice themselves for a cause because of injustice and there in that narrative there is anger and there is rage and there are significant groups of people in the world in our country who have due cause to be angry about the world  the refugee the ethnic minority the poor and one thing about inner engineering and sort of finding peace within oneself the other side of that coin is you know what is there ever a time to be angry to march to be enraged at the injustice of the world what would you say to that  you know che i know you this is not a popular name in america che guevara said if you are in rage you are one of us i said if you are out of rage youre one of us  if youre really out of rage youre definitely one of us because you think there is a reason for your anger which is a wrong perception if you look at it people get terribly angry with their loved ones theres a whole lot violence within the homes because they get terribly angry with their loved ones somebody that theyre living with and they have a good reason to get angry because she did not cook the breakfast properly or the dog peed where its not supposed to pee or i have seen people yelling and screaming and breaking their clubs on a golf course where theyre just having a good time  so im saying everybody has a reason to be angry anger means just this when youre angry as a doctor you know today that when youre angry literally youre generating poison in the system  literally if you are poisoning yourself internally and when youre angry you know you do the most idiotic things in your life when you turn back and see you cant believe you did it but most idiotic things happen when youre angry so im asking is it is anger an intelligent expression of human life or an idiotic expression of human life hello idiotic so thats all you need to know  the next time youre angry you just know youre stupid  because youre turning against yourself  so  but i will tell you the reason why this anger has been eulogized is in a moment of anger some people who were sleeping all their life propelled themselves into action and that action produced some results yes that can happen it may so happen you know that if i throw a stone at you instead of hitting you it hit the apple in the tree and the apple fell into your hands but thats by accident generally if i throw a stone your head will crack thats what is supposed to happen yes so i got angry and something got done so i think anger is a great way of doing things so when youre angry you yell and fume at somebody im asking all of you how many of you enjoy being yelled at and fumed by somebody else whether its your boss or your husband or your wife or your parents or anybody you really thoroughly enjoyed this  hello did you  no  no and what makes you think somebody else enjoys it they endure you they dont enjoy you and when theyre done theyre done  so it doesnt matter whether the anger happened to a man that you call as a prophet because we have a way of eulogizing everything which with which we have a distance of time suddenly anything which is over 1000 years becomes sacred in most peoples mind but whatever is happening right now however great it is they dont have the intelligence to recognize this people are saying the past things are great simply because everybody else is saying it not because they truly recognize but we are coming to a time if you dont do it your children will do this that is a time is coming in the world where unless it makes sense it doesnt come it doesnt matter from what source it comes from even if god comes and speaks here the next generation will reject it unless it makes sense to them this is a good development because instead of authority being the truth truth is becoming the authority its a good way to go but once this happens questions are going to rise  all kinds of questions with all due respect to every religious tradition on the planet i come from a land which has immense traditions unbelievable most most people in the world most indians are not even conscious of this how many traditions how many ways are there in that land when mark twain came to india he said anything that can ever be done either by man or god has been done in this land because the exploration is so incredible but with all due respect to all of them i say this that if you raise three fundamental questions ninety percent of the scriptural knowledge on the planet will collapse im sorry but this is the truth if you ask three pertinent questions you will see ninety percent of the scriptural knowledge on the planet will just collapse it cant stand scrutiny  so what are the three questions   you are not a scripture so why should i   oh no you said ask three questions  yes the fundamental questions if you ask simply you see the fundamental thing is this  you dont know where you came from you dont know where you will go you can believe if we work hard enough on you we can make you believe anything you must know this i was just talking to a group of people in nashville tennessee where our center is i was just telling them a joke in the joke i referred to god as him immediately a few ladies stood up and said do you believe god is a man i said whoa whoa whoa whoa i know what ive gotten into you know  i said i was just telling you a joke they said it doesnt matter you said him now this is a debate in america  is god a man or a woman i think this time in the election theyre trying to settle that issue  but where we come from we have no such issue we have a man god we have a woman god we have a cow god we have an elephant god we have a snake god we have a bird god we have a dog god we have every kind crawling ones creeping ones flying ones all kinds  because we are a very wise culture we foresaw all the future problems that may arise  and there is also a debate which in the last election they tried to settle but it did not settle i think people are debating in southern churches  is god black or white its a big serious debate happening people really debating about this  is god white or black well you know idi amin the uganda man idi amin declared god is black i agree with him because if a white man can have a white god why cant a black man have a black god but you know these people do not know because in these parts of the world only messiahs prophets sons others came they dont know in india we know god is brown  yes because god himself visited india nine times are you aware of this  you didnt know god visited india nine times himself indians are very proud of this  because god visited us himself nine times and he sent his son and messenger and others and others to other places  i keep reminding them thats because god wanted to do the job hands on with indians  he couldnt trust anybody else with indians  he came nine times and he failed   lets lets talk about  no coming to belief  im saying we can make people believe anything if you work upon them from their childhood  anything believe me you just have to work hard enough and make them believe this that everything belief gives you a confidence without clarity confidence without clarity is a disaster on this planet there is no substitute for clarity there is no substitute for clarity but if you have confidence you can just do something just like that sometimes it works even if youre not clear you can simply do something and itll work can i tell you a joke  please  this happened in new york city tch late afternoon a eightyearold boy came back from school he had a very progressive mother obviously she was single  im saying they couldnt nobody catch up with her  he came home and he asked momma is god man or woman she thought about all the gender issues and the coming election and everything and then she thought about it for a while and she said both the boy went into deep thought after a little while the boy came back and asked momma is god black or white again she thought about all the racial issues in the country and after considering this at length she said both the boy went into very deep thought then after some time he came back and asked momma is god straight or gay she again thought about it and then she said both the boy jumped in joy i got it i got it its michael jackson  so how how we arrived at our belief has cultural backing every culture has made up their own stuff but im asking do we genuinely know where we came from and where were going if youre so clear where youre going that is for an appointment with the creator i dont think you should postpone the appointment you must take it today isnt it but thats not true if death is next moment you dont want to go if you are so sure only that fanatic who blows himself up seems to be sure everybody else has a doubt isnt it every s working intelligence has a doubt yes or no if you have frozen your intelligence with overriding belief systems then youre going  every other working intelligence if death is next moment there is hesitation or no for sure isnt it because you really dont know where youre going you can believe what you want but you really do not know belief is of social significance to some extent of psychological significance but existentially it means nothing  can i ask your thoughts on this in some ways in many ways we are the inheritors of our traditions and they can and they do influence us and shape us is there a positive role for the traditions from whence we come for example if im gonna try to inner engineer my inner life and try to get some direction and meaning and faith and hope and values i cant do it alone and there are rich traditions hindu traditions judeochristian traditions muslim traditions that give some context some meaning some structure upon which to anchor my life what do you think about that do we throw away all the traditions and inner engineer our lives or can we use these traditions  as you said to anchor our lives now that is that is the decision that every human being has to make do you want to be anchored or do you want to set sail that is a decision that everybody has to make if youre looking for confidence if youre looking for stability then you have to anchor yourself to something if youre looking to go far then anchoring will not help traditions all traditions  with all due respect to all of them  particularly traditions that are coming from india and also elsewhere  im im not in any way an expert on to make a comment on the traditions that youre talking about but essentially tradition means this  what somebody did yesterday is todays culture and tradition what you do today is tomorrows culture and tradition im asking you how much of what were doing today in this world and in this country is consciously cultured but all the rubbish that we do will become tomorrows culture and tradition of this land isnt it so hello  yes  im saying do you believe that people who lived here 1000 years ago were such super human beings they did everything perfectly and youre doing everything wrong its not so they were also just people like you we have a way of eulogizing everything with which we have a certain distance of time but are they of no value not true therere a whole lot of things whole lot of things that we as human beings simply know today which is thanks to the traditions in which we have grown up we cannot say no but if you want to know this life which is myself no tradition is tradition can inspire you tradition can put you in a direction tradition cannot take you there because this has to happen now to you only then its a living reality for you otherwise you will read in a book and believe it but how do you know this works im saying it should work people ask me sadhguru how do we know whether we have met a real teacher or a guru or not i just tell them look at his face whether its worked for him what hes talking  has it worked for him thats all the question if its worked for him it doesnt matter what it is you must go with him because its worked for him if its not worked for him what is the point dead tradition  so one of the traditions here in a medical school in a western medical school is the tradition of the evidence  show me in this tradition which is only really maybe two or three hundred years old the randomized controlled trial the cohort study the all of that and its good thats how weve gotten cures for pneumonia and drugs to help alleviate pain and its all been done through this pursuit of the evidence the evidence and also im a pastor and i fully embrace the life of the spirit and the truth that we find in our faith traditions and i love that tradition but i do recognize a tension if you will between the truth that we discover in the lab and the truth that we discover in our spirit and i love that tension i think thats a great way to live in a way that sort of loving and joyful pursuit that is both the truth that i see around me and the love that grows in my heart but i do recognize the tension what is your perception of that  see when we talk about the evidencebased approach it is not a tradition when it happened when the renaissance happened it was breaking of all traditions till then because it was written in a book because a certain authority was espousing it we said this is it when medical science evolved from jenner  to others the fundamental thing was they broke all tradition so now if that is becoming a tradition im very sorry because this was an exploration an exploration cannot be traditional an exploration means youre constantly trying to step into new terrain thats what an exploration is but if that has become traditional then we are treading the same track and thinking its exploration this evidence based approach has done wonders to many many things no question but this entire process is dependent upon human intellect this is what we are just coming into we went off little bit human intellect by nature i am just asking you would you like it sharp or blunt if you want sharp if you have a sharp instrument let's say you have a knife in your hand what could you do to this flower with a knife you could cut it finely if you want but you can cut into pieces that's exactly what the intelligence does whatever you give it it will cut it open and try to see the way of evidence based science is disection fundamentally well even in the medical school im sure were in the pathology labs we are opening up fortunately the dead  but if you really want to know somebody someone whom you love very much if you really want to know them i think you should dissect them to know them would it work like that no obviously so there is one dimension of life which is physical in nature where dissection will work but what is physical about you the body that you carry is an accumulation that you gathered over a period of time its just the food that youve eaten it is actually a piece of the planet most people dont get this when theyre walking but the countless number of people who walked on this planet before you and me they are all topsoil today you and me also will be topsoil unless your friends choose to bury you real deep  fearing that you may raise from the dead  this is just the soil isnt it hello tch this is just the soil that you walk upon so this is an accumulation what you gather what you accumulate you can claim it is mine you cannot say its me isnt it right now as im speaking i say this is my glass you will think oh sadhguru seems to have a problem  but lets listen everybody says hes wise  after some time ill say this is me then you will say lets go home  because if i claim this is me you know it is it qualifies for madness isnt it whatever you acquire you can say this is mine but if you say this is me this is madness yes or no are there any psychiatrists do i do this does this qualify  it does so every day youre doing this food appeared on your plate you said this is my food you ate it and then you say its me this is madness but you have enormous company  and we believe in democracy whatever the majority says must be right so it is going on but the moment you believe something that is not you as yourself you kind of lost it youre derailed from life so turning inward does not mean dissection turning inward does not mean contemplation because the content of your body and the content of your mind is an accumulated substance isnt it you gathered it from outside what you gather from outside can be yours but can never ever be you so were talking about inner engineering not as twisting and turning the body not about taking on new attitudes of love or generosity compassion whatever great values and emotions that a human being can have i see all that as a consequence of a certain way of being rather than looking at it as a means to get somewhere everywhere people are talking about whatever see if you deprive somebody of something for a period of time simply qualities will raise to heaven today anywhere you go people are talking peace of mind is the ultimate goal of human life why because theyre freaked out in their minds  why would peace be the highest goal because youre talking about judeochristian thing the origin of where it came from i happened to be in tel aviv i am to 30 in the evening i was flying in from atlanta because of some delays in the flights 00 in the evening so im quickly changing in the airport because in these thirtyfive years ive not been late to a single appointment i dont want to break that so im rushing and i am famished because im traveling an american airline and theres nothing edible on the plane  im super hungry and i rush to the venue and to my joy i find the talk is in a fine restaurant life cant get better  so as i went in people are greeting me and one man comes up and says shalom i ask him what does it mean he says this is the highest way of greeting i said well thats your opinion but what does it mean he said no this is the highest way of greeting i said thats all right but what does the word mean he said it means peace i said why would peace be the highest way of greeting unless youre born in middle east  in south india you come up to me in the morning and say peace ill say whats wrong with you   id like to get back to the practice of medicine just for a question really i tell my gang whom i adore my residents my students are close to my heart i adore them  all gangs are like that   and i say i say medicine is easy medicine is easy but healing is hard because in medicine we have our potions and if we dont know an answer we do a test and if we dont know the what the test means we consult somebody and so medicine in some ways we can distill it down we can make it easy but healing healing is really where the art of medicine lies and healing is where the spirit and the love and the suffering and the treatments and the surgery thats where it all comes together how would you propose that we adopt a healing attitude how do we bring the spirit of healing into the experience of the bedside  please all of you dont be offended by what i say but you must look at this properly if i i i dont but if at any time if it becomes necessary i must go to a hospital i just want efficient treatment i dont want love  because im not deprived like that now unfortunately we are creating a population where everywhere people are talking about love we are deprived like this because early age deprivation of love will tell right through your life it is very important we need to understand that there is something more to this life  than the acquired body we have a body which we acquired theres something more there is a whole tradition in india unfortunately its rapidly vanishing because of variety of changes that are happening in the society otherwise how a mother should deal with a child till the child is fourandahalf years of age in the in the vernacular languages it says that she should wrap herself around the child in every possible way not because the food that you give the child the milk that you give the child is not the only nourishment the child needs to be wrapped with motherhood then only this child will grow as a fullfledged child otherwise it will grow as a deprived child but modern societies we are going to a place which is almost impossible to deliver this its simply not possible in the way we have structured our families its simply not possible to do that so having said that when people come to a hospital they should just look forward to efficient treatment now were looking for love we should have found it somewhere else at least we should have bought a dog  if you couldnt find anybody dog is you know if you get yourself a dog twelve years guaranteed love affair  guaranteed doesnt matter how badly behaved you are still its guaranteed itll not work with any human being  theres a whole lot of management to do with human beings if you get a dog however badly behaved you are you are a drunk you behave badly you beat him do what you do but the dog still loves you guaranteed love affair so those of you who are looking for love wherever you go dog is a good solution  when you go to a hospital you dont expect your doctor to love you just do what he has to do   so that is fascinating  because i think patients come to their doctors  this this is the unfortunate this is the unfortunate reality thats what im saying people come to a hospital and looking for love  wrong place   so when i was a when i was a medical student i was the pastor of a church here in town and i would write my sermons on hospital notepaper this was before emrs  so im writing my sermon at the nurses station and my attending physician came up to me and he said doolittle physicians are the priests of today i said what what do you mean thats offensi i wasnt sure what was he joking was he serious and he was serious  in the sense that people come to their doctor and they have pain and maybe its back pain may be it's pain in their hearts and i think people come to their physician and they look for absolution acceptance forgiveness they look to feel well again and perhaps the critique of modern medicine is that we are trained to give a pill but people want more and its interesting that you bring this up that in modern medicine the expectation should be efficient care safe care and thats what were trying to do too but i do think  there is a healing  maybe the world is becoming more secular and they dont know where to turn and so people look to their healthcare provider for all of it what do you think  see its not about being secular or nonsecular a whole lot of human beings are feeling lonely  yes  right from their childhood theyve suffered loneliness for variety of reasons changes have happened in family structure changes have happened in the social structure the communities of the past have broken so there is a certain loneliness where even if they go to a their car mechanic they want to be loved  you must go to your physician just the way you went to a car mechanic somebody who knows how to fix the car thats important whether he loves you or not is not your business but when you talk about healing theres another dimension were preparing people like this im bringing up hundreds of people where we have identified in the yogic culture i mean in the yogic science  the fundamental life energy manifests itself in five different ways five fundamental ways these five out of these five this is called as prana vayu samana vayu apana udhana and vyana in this there is one dimension called samana vayu which is very healing so before we introduce any kind of medical knowledge to a person we put them on very serious inner work to generate a certain level of samana vayu where a physician develops such a level of vitality if he walks into the room everything should light up this is very important physicians are walking into the patients room with a grave face grave is one thing that you should not point at when somebody is sick  grave is one thing that you dont show a patient a physician should generate such a level of vitality and life and healthfulness about themselves anything they touch will get better naturally not because of love not because of compassion people you know yesterday i was being interviewed by a young lady and she said sadhguru we must you know everything should happen out of compassion i asked her are you married she said yes my husband is waiting in the reception i said suppose when you go there after this interview you realize that your husband married you on a compassionate basis  would you like it she said no  then why do you want it for me  i dont need it too  so can i ask you with so for the isha foundation with the thousands of fulltime volunteers and the millions of parttime volunteers why do you think they come  tools of transformation the tools are subjective in nature see right now we as human beings are dominating this world only because of our ability to use tools otherwise a pack of dogs would take care of you forget about the tigers and the lions poor tigers and poor lions who need to be saved right now only because of our ability to use tools isnt it and all the tools that we developed are now as a doctor maybe youre using a microscope we have a microscope only because we are ability our ability to see to enhance that we have a scope we have a telescope only to enhance our vision in some other way we have a telephone because we can hear we have a microphone because we can speak we have a bicycle because we can walk if we were made like trees would we have invented a bicycle im asking every tool that we created is only in to enhance the already existing faculties to a higher level isnt it everything everything that we invented is just this all the tools the tools are very important when i refer to the spiritual dimension as tools some of our people will feel offended around me and say sadhguru dont say it it is more than our life dont use the word tool then i tell them you come to the yoga center three days i will give you plumbing job no spanner no wrench no nothing you do it with your hands you can use your teeth  you will see all your ten nails will be gone then a few teeth will be gone after three days then you come to me i will give you a spanner will you worship the spanner or no im asking you will you worship the spanner or no it is the tools similarly to turn inward to extend dimensions which youre youre every one of you have known peace in your life at some moment hello you must tell me yes or no  you have known joy in your life  you have known bliss in your life  you have known ecstasy in your life love in your life you are capable of all these things only thing is its not sustainable one moment there one moment here one moment there one moment here  this is the only problem isnt it suppose i gave you a tool subjective tool with which you can remain blissful every moment of your life is it of great value to you im asking  so these millions of people they have tasted the tools of transformation one thing i have done to them is  i have confused the hell out of them   so what is that tool of transformation how would you describe that  this is the first tool first thing is you must get confused  yes because you are talking about anchoring thats why im saying this confusion means you realize that you do not know isnt it im asking with all this exploration of science do we know even one single atom in its entirety hello do we no then whats our problem in saying we dont know i do not know is an immense possibility now youre trying to destroy i do not know with all kinds of beliefs why dont you say i do not know if you truly realize i do not know your intelligence will be in a active and super alert state every moment of your life the moment you believe it sleeps it lets you sleep but people are not willing to go through this they want something tell them something they want to believe and say im fine i want to sleep tonight no i do not know if you see i do not know the longing to know the wanting to know the seeking to know will happen to you everything that you do not know you just believe because somebody said so even if it is true right now im going to tell you what is the truth but its not in your experience so what is the options that you have you can believe me or you can disbelieve me isnt it if you believe me you will not get any closer to truth if you disbelieve me you will not get any closer to truth it is just that if you believe me you will have a positive story to tell if you disbelieve me you will have a negative story to tell but you will not move an inch existentially psychologically it will give you comfort so this is something you must decide are you looking for solace or are you looking for a solution if youre looking for solution then you need tools to turn inward if youre looking for solace believe something  so if the first step is i dont know what do you do then what happens after that   see this happened to me when i was just four fourandahalf years of age suddenly one day i realized i dont know a thing i was only about fourandahalf years of age if somebody gave me a glass of water i would just sit like this for threefour hours at a stretch because i wouldnt know what is water im telling you even today you dont know what is water it is the only substance which is in all the three states on the planet twothirds of your body is water twothirds of the planet is water but you dont know what it is we know how to use it but we dont know what it is isnt it so we know how to use this water in so many ways but we do not know what it really is because we do not know what really anything is for that matter so if i found a leaf i would simply sit like this for sixseven hours if i sat up in the bed entire night i would be staring at the darkness my dear father who is a physician  started thinking i need psychiatric evaluation he started saying this boy has lost it hes just staring at something all the time my problem is i look at this and i dont know this im not able to shift my attention to that im just looking here still he thought he could educate me he tried so there is a rule strict rule in the house 00 dinner time you all the children four of us siblings we have to sit and read some textbook i open my textbook like this  i find a little speck on the paper i just look at the paper   this speck keeps me engaged for two hours i sit like this absolutely total attention without reading a word i went through school like this i was very consistent i always got six zeros in every test   so if if its not shalom or compassion or love   it is just life  its just what would you is that what you say the meaning of  its just life  the meaning the purpose  no no  your purpose of life  is life what would you say  the purpose of life is life itself  yeah  is life itself is a large enough phenomena it doesnt need another meaning only because human beings have not experienced life theyre just a bundle of thoughts emotions ideas opinions identities and prejudices  sadhguru  because of this theyre looking for a meaning because theyre psychological scape has overshadowed the existential life that they are right now all that theyre experiencing is a minimalistic mind not life if you look at life what is the nature of life as you sit there we are breathing for sure hello  those who are not will need medical attention  were breathing breathing means in some way this life  is in communication with the entire atmosphere in fact this this green you know project greenhands of planting trees the entire movement was instigated like this by me i took a bunch of people about 34000 people came i said all of you should come they came i arranged a meeting in a village there was a big tree a rain tree a few three four trees were there large trees but i arranged the meeting around eleven oclock in the hot sun in southern india so i stood there and i am speaking to them they are all  sitting like this slowly as the sun gets hotter hotter theyre just wilting away and im speaking and speaking something telling them stories and im watching how theyre just wilting away see walking in the sun is one thing if you simply sit there itll just burn you down theyre just thinking whats happened to sadhguru hes become like this heartless  then after about an hourandahalf when theyre really going down then i say get up all of you and i then i walk them under the shade of the tree ahh you know what a tree is only if you sit in the sun in hot sun for an hourandahalf two then walk under the tree it feels like paradise they all  hahh i made them sit down and said see what you exhale the trees are inhaling what the trees exhale you are inhaling look at this one part of your lung is hanging out there and i created a process with which they could experience this they just sat there like this with tears in their eyes and that is it project greenhands twentyseven million trees they have planted  yeah very nice  now you cant stop them  theyre planting and planting because now they see its a part of them is it not true that you exist here as a part of everything else it is just that its a privilege though you are a speck in the universe less than a speck still we are given an intellect we have been given senses of perception we can experience this like an individual but in reality if you observe yourself you cannot exist by yourself even for a a nanosecond isnt it the entire universe is supporting you so the only way life can happen is an inclusive way so yoga means just this the word yoga means union union means the boundaries of what is inward and outward you took it away there is no such thing as you and the other if you sit here we can do an experiment actually i dont know if time allows if you sit here and suppose for one moment you experienced all these people here as a part of yourself like you experience the five fingers of your hand how is that possible well what is this body today yesterday it was not your body isnt it it was food today its become body so something that is not you became you how right now there is water this is not you if i drink it does it become me definitely does so what is it that i have done i included it into the boundaries of my sensations what is within my boundaries of sensation i experience as myself what is outside of my boundaries of sensation is not me now the yogic system we developed a way that if you keep your energies in a certain level of exuberance now you will see your sensory body will expand if your sensory body became as large as this hall and you experienced all these people as yourself after that do i have to tell you love them dont hate them dont kill them dont harm them be compassionate would teachings be necessary for you if you experience something as a part of yourself after that you dont need any morality you dont need any ethic you dont need any values what is you you will always handle it right what is you it is of the highest concern to you if you experienced everyone and everything as yourself this is what yoga means if one is in such a state of union then you call him a yogi if you turn and twist your body and hang upside down you are not a yogi you are just doing circus  yes unfortunately people think by turning and twisting theyre doing yoga no yoga means you sat here you experience the entire universe as yourself  not as a hallucination but as a living experience not in the firmament of your mind but existentially you know this is you now you dont need any policy you don't need any morality you dont need any scripture you dont need any guidance from anywhere you will conduct this  sensibly to the best of your intelligence and capability and thats all a human being can do  sadhguru  so weve reached  my question is touching back to the point which you brought up about the belief can you tell a little bit more about whats the difference between belief and faith   youre trying to gather more information   as much as i can in one hour  that is the biggest problem you can gather as much as you want you could if you gather a lot youll become fat but you will not feel enhanced the only thing that every life is seeking is to enhance itself to its fullest possible level whether you take a worm or an insect or a bird or a tree all of them want to become fullfledged life only problem is we know what is a fullfledged worm we know what is a fullfledged insect we know what is a fullfledged tree but we dont know what is a fullfledged human being now you think by acquiring more and more i don't know what information you gathered but by acquiring more and more you will not become more it has not happened isnt it people thought by acquiring money by acquiring wealth by acquiring knowledge they will become more they have not become more theyre still hankering for the same things so by acquiring more information you will not become enhanced it is just that if you approach information sensibly you will become more hungry if you approach information as a way of projecting yourself as better than somebody else then you will think you have attained to something this is what happens by acquiring information only in comparison its valuable if you have certain level of information you need somebody around you who doesnt know it for you to be looking smart yes  today its become a fashion before they go to a dinner party they will google out that galaxy z67 how many million light years is it so when you go to a dinner party just like that casually you throw around  you know the galaxy z67 it is you know how many light years this many light years who the hell cares  because we dont even know in our experience what is a light year  it is only a mathematical calculation it is not really anybodys experience there is no human being on this planet past or present whos ever experienced a light year theres no such thing it is only a mathematic calculation to somehow come to terms with the immeasurable dimensions of the existence were trying to somehow quantify it so that it comes into our understanding but nothing comes into our understanding as science explores more and more it is only getting more confounded the only reason why science is surviving is because its throwing out useful technologies on the side if that was not there science is far more confused in hundred years of exploration than it ever was before but thats a good sign if they had made stupid conclusions they would be a one more religion science is confounded today the top physicists in the world are saying we not only do not know we know we will never know  this is a good sign because this means your intelligence will remain on an explorative mode all the time  on an active mode not in a sleep mode so when when the top scientists declare we will not know it is not a hopeless situation it is a great situation that people have come to this that they understand if you go through physical means it doesnt matter how much you explore itll go on endlessly how much information you have you will not get any better you will get only more burdened by this things will happen on the side technologies will come iphone will become seven eight twelve all right but still the way you talk to people is not going to change  what you say will not change your relationships will not change technology can go through the ceiling but nothing of you will be enhanced so more information more information is not going to help all i want you to take  the takeaway for you because you want to take away something   the takeaway for you is if you truly genuinely  its not simply a thought  allow this to sink into you in the next few days that if you pay attention to anything a leaf a flower water people dog animals anything anything if you pay enough attention to anything around you even the closest people around you if you pay enough attention to them you will see you dont know a damn thing about anything on the surface you seem to know everything but if you pay sufficient attention you don't know a thing about anything knowledge is a very limited sphere of life ignorance is boundless enjoy that   so in the spirit of boundless ignorance does anyone else have any questions theres a lot maybe someone  she has the microphone yeah   yeah you got the mike go ahead  hello thank you very much for a wonderful lecture and youre definitely very smart man  my question is  thats the worst insult anybody has thrown at me   he started by saying he doesnt know anything that was his whole   maybe this is the main sign of a smart person so my question is that you mentioned before that just belief without clarity is not a good thing and im absolutely impressed by amount of volunteers like millions of the volunteers i cannot even imagine how many people come flown in and not volunteer and so its a lot do you think they are all driven by clarity and search for clarity or they believe that once they will do inner engineering they will work on the process of gaining joy and eventually they will have a positive story with you or the positive story as you mentioned before thank you  see if for any human being to do something either it should have worked for them or it should have worked for somebody around them if you want to buy a car either you will test drive it and see whether it works for you or youll ask the opinion of your friend who is driving that particular car is this been good for you yes or no so i must tell you a as a rule for the first twenty twentyone years of my existence as a teacher as a rule i never appeared in the media  never once   to a point where media started writing about me hes running some kind of a secret school  because i refused to meet the media no advertisement no any kind of posters not even a brochure only by wordofmouth millions of people came because once it works for somebody they want it to work for their family their friends and things thats how it happened in the last fifteen years or sixteen years now  fifteen actually  from 2001 is when you have heard about me all over because were making a lot of noise in the last fifteen years because these projects which we started as small endeavors in the local area caught on so well and they became such major projects of planting trees education health we are active in 53000 villages so it needs enormous support otherwise this can't be done for a a nonreligious movement which doesnt offer any miracles like this never before as i know in the last two hundred three hundred years never before a spiritual movement has caught on this kind of following where no ticket to heaven no miracles no any kind of stuff only thing im telling them is badgering them that you are the source of all your troubles  nobody else but you but millions are gathering which is very  fantastic because i must tell you this about thirty years ago when i conducted programs over eightyfive percent of the people came because of health reasons  physical mental ailments today on an average only about twelve percent of the people are coming for health reasons the rest are coming because theyre seeking they want to know they want to experience they want their lives to be touched in a deeper way than the way it is touched right now this is a phenomenal change that youre seeing in the world its never before i think only twelve percent are coming for health reasons but at one time over eighty percent were coming for health reasons which is a big shift  any other question maybe someone from up above there youre right there in the front can you shout your question out  i was wondering if physical ailments or healthrelated physical ailments can be cured by or at least helped by yoga  there are we must understand there are two kinds of ailments in the yogic system we look at health issues as two ways one is caused by external organisms which i think modern medicine has handled in a phenomenal way in fact the birth of modern medicine happened mainly because of the epidemics and pandemics which were happening at that time where it would wipe out populations it is that which inspired people to experiment and do the things that they did and when they found solutions that is when suddenly the the trust of the population shifted from one to another simply because they could eliminate epidemics and these were caused by external organisms but seventy percent of human ailments are on selfhelp that is they cause it to themselves in so many ways for whatever reasons knowingly unknowingly they do it to themselves this seventy percent of ailments that people cause to themselves can be undone from within but if you have an infection you must go to the doctor if you have pneumonia you must immediately go to the doctor  dont try to do yoga  now are there instances we have thousands and thousands of people i would say hundreds and thousands of people who walked out of their ailments without ever being treated for them we dont treat people for yoga i must tell you this because we are in a medical institution a bunch of doctors from united states came to our yoga center we were we have a yogic hospital so about twelve of them largely from this michigan area and they came and stayed for three days and on the fourth day they were very upset and they wanted to leave i was very busy i couldnt meet them and somebody came and told me sadhguru all these doctors are very upset they want to go i said what happened they are just very upset that there is no yogic hospital here you told them there is yogic hospital they think there is no yogic hospital then i said okay let me see them  then i saw them they were really upset they were angry they were f they felt cheated that there is no yogic hospital here where are the patients where are the uniformed nurses and doctors walking up and down i said see at that time on that day maybe there were over seventy patients but i said i thought ill put them to good use and i was making them work in the gardens  nobody should ever understand sickness is a reward they must want to get out of it as quickly as possible right now were treating patients in such a way people would want to be sick whenever they want attention not just that one important part of the yogic treatment is what is called as bhuta shuddhi this means syncing and purifying the elements within you water earth water air fire and space these five dimensions you can work on this is the fundamentals of yoga so one of the most important thing is i want them barefoot with open hands to work in the garden to just get in touch with the earth be outside get in touch with the air water earth half their ailments are gone treatment is there little bit rest is all just connection with the world around because this  is a composite of all these things you remove yourself and keep yourself in a completely alien atmosphere where youre not in touch youre four inches above the ground all the time  you will lose contact with what makes your life its the very soil which youre carrying as your body is it not important that it needs to be touched with its origins no youre looking up no your life happens from this planet there are other dimensions to it of course but physical health and the physical nature around you are very closely related if you dont connect them health is an accident for most people today i see america probably has the highest incidents of allergies is that so am i right very high this is mainly because theyre removed from everything thats natural theyre not in touch with anything that is natural everything is tampered with those who are living in the open even in america im sure they have no allergy they have no issue of any kind theyre doing fine i think the homeless people are the most healthy people in the end  theyre enduring all kinds of you know variations in weather and still managing pretty well without healthcare   we probably have time for one more question in the back right there shout it out  how to look for internal peace  how to  how to look for internal peace  whoa whoa you just came in    sorry was that internal peace or eternal peace  internal  internal peace  okay now  we weve gone through this anyway whether its peace or happiness or joy or love or whatever it can only be internal it cant be external now there are many ways to address this but one simple way is just this  you just have to learn where the keyboard is for this big computer of your mind right now you dont know where the keyboard is youre punching it somehow   something works no if you know where the keyboard is you would type out the right things isnt it fundamentally its just that your mind is not taking instructions from you dont ask for peace dont ask for joy dont ask for love just you have to understand the mechanics of how this body and this mind works and then you cause whatever you want if you like turmoil cause it if you want love cause it if you want hate cause it thats up to you but i trust you that if you are capable of causing pleasantness or unpleasantness within you you will choose the highest form of pleasantness for yourself i trust you on that one now that you know it started with this fiftyfour percent of doctors suffering which is unfortunate doctors all said and done are rendering a very key aspect of service to any given society its very important that they are well i i would like to make this offering that the doctors who are interested in this we would like to offer them the tools of inner engineering so that they go out as truly healthy joyful life which is full of vitality that their very presence is an inspiration for health for everybody who comes in touch with them this must happen otherwise what are we talking about health were talking medicine medicine is a business health is an aspiration for every human being if this fundamental aspiration is not fulfilled you cannot lead a human being to any other aspiration right now there is some trouble in your body i will talk about enlightenment are you interested im asking no your back is aching i will talk enlightenment youre not interested will my backache go thats the only question isn't it because body has this power unless you keep your body in such a way that you dont know whether it is here or not this is what yoga means that your body becomes like breeze if you sit here you dont know whether your body is here or not otherwise if you sit here for oneandahalf hours your body says i must go to the bathroom your body says i must drink your body says i must do something because it is in a state of compulsive needs if you bring it to ease on all levels you will not know whether body is here or not if you are in such a state youre not even conscious whether its here or not you have no gender issues you dont care whether youre a man or a woman right now yes it should not matter im saying therere only two places where your gender should matter  bathrooms and bedrooms  nowhere else  and some people even debate that which you go to which bathroom  it doesnt matter which bathroom so just its the bedroom   everything is under debate  but im saying to move the body from compulsive needs to a place where it is like a stepping stone not an impediment for your life right now the compulsiveness of the body is making people do all kinds of things in the world people are not able to raise to a place where they can do something other than the compulsive things that every other creature does simply because theyve not kept their body as it should be kept this body can be upgraded to a place where it will function like an antenna which will download the cosmos even if that doesnt happen to you right now the physicians of the world at least they must become an embodiment of health and vitality this must happen whatever is needed from our end were willing to do for yale and you sir doolittle  thank you so much  and i am dr donothing   so thank everybody lets thank sadhguru for his visit with us  thank you so much what a great joy wonderful to have you
