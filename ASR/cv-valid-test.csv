/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001045.wav,103724,he was immensely excited at the news
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001164.wav,170540,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001908.wav,82220,the boy was relieved
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001782.wav,92204,at once he connected the two incidents
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001536.wav,106796,then the thing came upon him in a flash

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001409.wav,279596,i think its too overwhelming to introduce two complex tools that basically do the same things
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001046.wav,119084,it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001909.wav,102188,the first day passed
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001659.wav,311852,but when the reign of tiberius ended his poems were forgotten
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001286.wav,143660,all they think about is food and water
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001537.wav,184364,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001910.wav,210476,the boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001047.wav,215852,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001538.wav,153644,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001784.wav,165164,so you got married

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001049.wav,198956,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001169.wav,140588,some went away while i was there and other people came
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001913.wav,111404,the old man said nothing
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001412.wav,94508,and he gave the boy his blessing
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001663.wav,185900,i left my father my mother and the town castle behind

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001664.wav,65324,what do you know about that
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001170.wav,157484,the burning fire had been extinguished
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001050.wav,236588,they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001541.wav,198188,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001787.wav,120620,alchemy is a serious discipline
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001171.wav,65324,what's the matter with you

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001414.wav,174380,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001052.wav,154412,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001292.wav,134444,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001915.wav,125996,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001790.wav,49964,what do you think
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001415.wav,180524,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001173.wav,272684,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001544.wav,169004,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001054.wav,145196,he turned on the microphone just as the hen was ready to squawk
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001916.wav,61484,it's the only name i've got
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001055.wav,102188,the boy began to dig into the dune
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001791.wav,153644,and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001293.wav,99884,i know she writes them
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001416.wav,98348,but the boy couldn't even speak
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001174.wav,186668,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001668.wav,96044,i myself heard nothing of that
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001294.wav,118316,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001056.wav,157484,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001917.wav,134444,it wasn't clear to him how to spend his morning time
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001792.wav,139052,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001295.wav,40748,it would kill you
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001175.wav,123692,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001417.wav,150572,it seemed he had made the long journey for nothing
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001057.wav,152108,i say we don't go out any more

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001546.wav,103724,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001918.wav,145964,i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001670.wav,117548,the alien gurgled and thrashed its tentacles
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001547.wav,107564,but she is gone
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001794.wav,169004,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001919.wav,159788,he just got a new kite for his birthday
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001671.wav,65324,who engineered this getaway
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001177.wav,83756,people say strange things the boy thought
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001296.wav,186668,the sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001419.wav,184364,our deadline is coming up rapidly and we will need help

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001059.wav,126764,because its growth hormone runs away from sunlight

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001420.wav,248108,but the tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001921.wav,111404,the boy was astonished by what he saw inside
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001549.wav,211244,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001298.wav,71468,it was a bundle of money
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001061.wav,76844,never mind those guys
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001179.wav,214316,two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001673.wav,225836,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001299.wav,95276,and he wasn't faring much better
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001922.wav,96044,it took her a while to get used to it
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001180.wav,119084,the first day passed
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001421.wav,165932,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001674.wav,131372,we've got to do something
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001797.wav,102188,but they could never have taught him arabic
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001062.wav,161324,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001551.wav,218924,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001923.wav,103724,i wished i had a light to smoke by
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001422.wav,255788,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001300.wav,82988,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001063.wav,67628,i wouldn't be a bit surprised
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001798.wav,139052,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001675.wav,167468,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001924.wav,199724,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001423.wav,214316,there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001181.wav,107564,where was his horse
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001552.wav,199724,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001301.wav,102956,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001064.wav,119084,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001799.wav,123692,but she hadn't charged him anything
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001424.wav,70700,on the  o'clock train
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001553.wav,92204,its lower end was still embedded
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001925.wav,102188,back into the excavation
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001302.wav,115244,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001676.wav,245804,they filled three sacks

/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-003536.wav,215852,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
/datadrive/speechexperiments/datasets/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-003413.wav,122924,because the crystal was dirty
