p6
aVthis is the first event in this series
p7
aVin which sadhguru will be in conversation with students
p8
ag6
aVi now request ishan  saksham and om prakash to come on the stage  
p9
aVishan is a final year dual degree computer science student 
p10
aVsaksham is a third year engineering physics student
p11
aVand om prakash is a final year m tech mechanical engineering student  
p12
aVnow i hand it over to sadhguru and the students
p13
aVto begin the conversation 
p14
aV namaskaram to everyone 
p15
aV good evening  everyone 
p16
aVfirst of all i would like to extend a very warm welcome to sadhguru to iit 
p17
aVit s a very rare occasion for us as a institute to have you here 
p18
aVso before we begin the conversation
p19
aVi would just like to put it in context 
p20
aVso when we got to know about sadhguru coming to iit
p21
aVwe were thinking of
p22
aVhow would it be appropriate to be able to represent of the thoughts of the community
p23
aVin the limited time by limited number of people
p24
aVso we thought of the idea of crowd sourcing the questions
p25
aVso we crowd sourced the question to everyone
p26
aVand people responded with a lot of questions
p27
aVand we had a hard time compiling them 
p28
aVso we prepared a cocktail of questions after crowd sourcing
p29
aVand we ve tried to represent all the different themes that are asked 
p30
aVso just beginning with the conversation
p31
aVi d like to start with a very silly and yet existential and fundamental question 
p32
aVso given that we are here on this planet for a limited life 
p33
aVgiven that we are human  we would not live forever 
p34
aVso what do you think is the wise way
p35
aVto spend the years on this planet  
p36
aV i know what
p37
aVcan you hear me 
p38
aVi know what all the professors would like me to say  
p39
aVthe wise is way is you must be focused on your academics 
p40
aVthat s all the concern is but
p41
aVwe must look at this 
p42
aVall life on this planet 
p43
aVanything that you take 
p44
aVa worm 
p45
aVan insect 
p46
aVa bird 
p47
aVan animal 
p48
aVa tree
p49
aVor a human being 
p50
aVthe only thing that every life is aspiring for is
p51
aVit is trying to become a full fledged life 
p52
aVan earthworm is trying to be an full fledged earthworm 
p53
aVa grasshopper is trying to be a full fledged grasshopper 
p54
aVa mango tree is trying to be a full fledged mango tree 
p55
aVso is a human being 
p56
aVonly thing is we know what is a full fledged earthworm 
p57
aVwe know what is a full fledged grasshopper 
p58
aVwe know what is a full fledged everything
p59
aVbut we do not know what is a full fledged human being 
p60
aVdoesn t matter what you do
p61
aVsomehow seems inadequate 
p62
aVno matter where you get in your life
p63
aVyou will see there is one more thing to do 
p64
aVnever does a human being come to a place
p65
aVwhere he thinks this is it 
p66
aVthat only other people say when you re dead 
p67
aVthis is it  
p68
aVso
p69
aVthe essential nature of life not just human life 
p70
aVevery life is
p71
aVit is longing to become a full fledged life 
p72
ag56
aVso wherever you may be in your life right now
p73
aVyou want to be something more 
p74
aVif that something more happens
p75
ag74
aVif that happens something more 
p76
aVyou will see whatever your aspirations right now
p77
aVas students suppose
p78
aVall of them get fulfilled within the next one year 
p79
aVyou will immediately see you will have another aspiration 
p80
aVif everything that you want gets all fulfilled by tomorrow morning
p81
aVyou will see you will have much more things to do
p82
aVbecause the very nature of being human is such
p83
aVyou always want to be something more 
p84
aVbut if you really look at it
p85
aVwhat you want is not something more 
p86
aVwhat you want is a limitless expansion 
p87
aVeven if i make you the king of this planet
p88
aVdon t look at me hopefully  
p89
aVi will not make such a blunder  
p90
aVbut suppose we make you the king of this planet 
p91
aVdo you believe you will be fulfilled 
p92
aVyou will look at the stars 
p93
aVif you have this planet in your hands
p94
ag93
aVif i give you one galaxy you will look at the next galaxy  
p95
aVthis is the nature of the human being 
p96
aVthere is something within us
p97
aVwhich is always longing to become boundless 
p98
aVbut in most human beings
p99
aVbecause of their fear of suffering
p100
aVthey think that if they desire for something and it doesn t happen they will suffer 
p101
aVbecause of the fear of suffering
p102
aVthis longing to become boundless is finding a very constipated expression 
p103
aVthis constipated expression of longing for the boundless
p104
aVgets labeled as ambition 
p105
aVwhat you think is ambition is just a constipated expression
p106
aVfor a boundless expansion that every life is longing for 
p107
aVbut you will see in your life
p108
aVno matter what happens
p109
aVyou will see you will want something more 
p110
aVthis somebody may label it as greed 
p111
aVit is not about greed
p112
aVbecause the very nature of the human being is such
p113
aVno matter how many pacifists  philosophies you teach him
p114
aVyou cannot contain him 
p115
aVpeople have told you 
p116
aVyou must be happy with what you have 
p117
aVwhatever god has given you that should be the right thing for you
p118
aVbut it s not worked for one human being on this planet 
p119
aVit only works either when you re very sick or very old 
p120
aVotherwise if you have little energy coursing through your body
p121
aVyou want to do something more 
p122
aVso it s not more 
p123
aVa human being
p124
aVthere is something within you which doesn t like boundaries 
p125
aVif i imprison you in a five by five cubicle
p126
aVyou will feel terribly imprisoned 
p127
aVthen we will liberate you tomorrow into a ten by ten cubicle 
p128
aVyou will feel wonderful for a day
p129
aVbut again you will feel imprisoned 
p130
aVthe next day we will release you into a hundred by hundred cubicle 
p131
aVyou will feel really great
p132
aVbut in three days again you ll want to break that boundary 
p133
aVit doesn t matter where i set the boundary 
p134
aVthe moment you become conscious of the boundary
p135
aVyou want to break that boundary 
p136
ag96
aVso there is something within you
p137
aVwhich does not like boundaries 
p138
aVso if you do not like boundaries
p139
aVwhat should you seek  that s a question 
p140
aVas long as you live in the physical nature of the existence
p141
aVthe very nature of physicality is a defined boundary 
p142
aVonly because there is a defined boundary physical is possible 
p143
aVwe can call this a physical body
p144
aVbecause it has boundaries 
p145
aVif i pull out all the boundaries
p146
aVthis will not be physical anymore 
p147
aVso somewhere unconsciously
p148
aVevery human being is wanting to touch a dimension beyond physical nature 
p149
aVif you touch a dimension beyond the physical nature
p150
aVthen we use the much maligned and corrupted word called spirituality 
p151
aVspiritual means not looking up or looking down 
p152
aVspiritual means your experience of life has transcended
p153
aVthe limitations of being physical 
p154
aVsomething more than physical is happening to you 
p155
aVthis means you are on the spiritual process 
p156
aVso this longing is there in every human being
p157
aVso essentially it doesn t  what you do in your life 
p158
aVour activity is not about us 
p159
aVactivity is about the world that we live in 
p160
aVtoday you are here in twenty first century so you guys are in iit 
p161
aVsuppose you were here 5000 years ago where would you be 
p162
aV in a jungle 
p163
aV hmm  no  no  
p164
aVyou know  5000 years ago they were talking mahabharata  ramayan
p165
aVso you would be in one of those armies trying to shoot a arrow   
p166
aVhey  you can t shoot anything  
p167
aVyou were trying to learn to fight with somebody in a sword or something else of the day 
p168
aVi m saying your mind 
p169
aVyour application 
p170
aVyour fulfillment in activity would be all that type of activity relevant to the times 
p171
aVour activity is always about the times in which we exist 
p172
aVit s not about us really 
p173
aVwhat times do we exist 
p174
aVwhat is most needed right now  that s what we do 
p175
aVbut how to be is the question 
p176
aVif it comes to how to be
p177
aVthere s only one way to be
p178
aVthat somewhere in every human being there is a longing
p179
aVto expand beyond physical limitations 
p180
aVthis is happening in four different ways 
p181
aVif it finds a very basic physical expression we call this sexuality 
p182
aVyou are trying to expand the boundary of who you are 
p183
aVwhat you are not you are trying to include as yourself 
p184
aVthis is what sexuality is 
p185
aVif it finds an emotional expression we call this love 
p186
aVonce again something that is not you 
p187
aVyou are trying to make it a part of you 
p188
aVif it finds a mental expression it gets labeled as
p189
aVambition 
p190
aVgreed 
p191
aVconquest
p192
aVor simply shopping  
p193
aVif it finds a conscious process then we call it yoga 
p194
aVyoga means not twisting your body or turning your body 
p195
aVyoga means union 
p196
aVin some way consciously you learn
p197
aVhow to obliterate the boundaries of your individual nature 
p198
aVnow your ability to experience yourself beyond your physical existence
p199
aVhas become a living reality for you 
p200
aVthis is everybody s longing
p201
aVbut it finds constipated expression 
p202
aVinstead of that if you find a conscious expression 
p203
aVlife will be very  very different 
p204
aV so you said that it s a very continuous journey of expansion and
p205
aVlike having this conscious expression would make it very different
p206
aVbut this is very easier said than done 
p207
aVso like doing it is a journey all together 
p208
aVso if i m on this journey
p209
aVso i d have personal aspirations 
p210
aVi d have spiritual aspirations
p211
aVbut there s also a conflict with the societal life that i live in 
p212
aVthere are responsibilities on me from my family 
p213
aVthere are some social boundations that i have
p214
aVwhile trying to be limitless 
p215
aVso how do i cope with this conflict 
p216
aVor in fact i d like to ask that
p217
aVis it even possible that we are able to draw a synthesis between the two 
p218
aV you are talking like a much married man  
p219
aVthis is usually a diplomatic way of saying i m married  
p220
aVsee  we need to understand this 
p221
aVthough everybody is thinking they are shaping their own lives and whatever 
p222
aVthe human longing to expand is not your doing 
p223
aVthis is the nature of life itself 
p224
aVit s not something that i aspire for a spiritual process 
p225
aVthere s no such thing 
p226
aVevery human being is longing for expansion 
p227
aVwill they long for it consciously or unconsciously
p228
aVthat s all the choice is 
p229
aVanyway every human being is longing for expansion 
p230
aVeven the beggar on the street is looking for little expansion of his territory  isn t it 
p231
aVyes or no 
p232
aVso wanting to expand is not your doing or my doing 
p233
aVthis is the nature of life 
p234
aVit s invested in us 
p235
aVnow what we are doing in the world today
p236
aVis just a question of the times in which we exist 
p237
aVokay  we have little choices 
p238
aVwhether you want to do art  music or engineering or medicine or
p239
aVsomething like this but essentially all this activities
p240
aVare supposed to be for human well being  isn t it 
p241
aVso fundamentally there s only one business of human well being 
p242
aVthe question is
p243
aVwhat is your competence 
p244
aVwhat is the nature of your  you know 
p245
aVintelligence so that how you could be most useful so you will choose that 
p246
aVthis does not determine 
p247
aVyou doing an engineering program or a medical program or an art program
p248
aVshould not decide the nature of who you are 
p249
aVthat only decides the nature of your activity 
p250
aVnot the nature of who you are 
p251
aV so continuing with this
p252
aVwhat is the role of a guru in a person s journey  
p253
aVhow do we students or as people over here 
p254
aVhow do we find a guru
p255
aVand how do we know that  that person is actually
p256
aVa guru is actually leading us to the correct path 
p257
aV if he confuses the hell out of you
p258
aVand you still like him  he s your guru
p259
aV 
p260
aVif somebody is trying to help you to find certainty
p261
aVin an uncertain world
p262
aVhe is not your guru 
p263
aVhe is trying to sing a lullaby to you  you understand 
p264
aVthe nature of life is such
p265
aVthat every moment it is changing and evolving into something else
p266
aVbut somebody tries to create certainty 
p267
aVdon t worry  god will take care of you 
p268
aVgod is holding your hand 
p269
aVeverything will be fine 
p270
ag270
aVthey ve been saying this for a long time
p271
aVbut life has buggered people very badly in so many ways 
p272
aVyes
p273
aVso this is not about inventing
p274
aVa psychological certainty
p275
aVand getting completely delinked from the reality of the existence 
p276
aVthe nature of the existence is such
p277
aVnothing can be stagnant here 
p278
aVit is only the dynamic nature from atomic to cosmic
p279
aVthat is keeping the existence going
p280
aVincluding the human being and every other life 
p281
aVso a guru is not somebody who ll give you solace 
p282
aVhe is a solution because
p283
aVthe only reason why you may need him is
p284
aVbecause it s an unfamiliar terrain 
p285
aVsee  every year i trek in the himalayas 
p286
aVindian part or generally now in nepal and tibet 
p287
aVthere this sherpa guy who leads me on 
p288
aVwell  your lungs will be in your mouth 
p289
aVyou are at eighteen thousand feet
p290
aVand your lungs is in your mouth
p291
aVand you re determined 
p292
aVyou re going step by step 
p293
aVthey re two roads  this looks nice and easy 
p294
aVthis guy says  
p295
aVhe won t say 
p296
aVsadhguru ji  please  this is the way  
p297
aVno    
p298
aVhe s carrying my bags and he s illiterate
p299
aVbut he says  like this 
p300
aVwithout argument i follow 
p301
aVthough this looks better to me i just follow
p302
aVbecause i know he knows the terrain better than me 
p303
aVi know the mountains very well
p304
aVbut still i know he knows it better than me 
p305
aVonce i recognize that it is sensible to follow him 
p306
aVif you do your own thing you won t last 
p307
aVthe same thing goes with the inner terrain 
p308
aVwhen you go into a terrain that s unfamiliar to you 
p309
aVit s best to go with somebody who s already walked the terrain
p310
aVotherwise to find your neighborhood
p311
aVyou may round the planet and come back 
p312
aVthat is also one way
p313
aVbut it s a brief life  
p314
aV so i want to bring to a different theme
p315
aV why you  why are you copying questions  
p316
aV i just wanted to
p317
aV i ve seen people copying answers but  
p318
aV as students a lot of us
p319
aVespecially in institute like iit
p320
aVwe did a survey and we found that
p321
aVa lot of students are under stress
p322
aVand we re used to a reward and punishment mechanism 
p323
aVso till the time there s no sword hanging on us 
p324
aVtill the time there s no deadline 
p325
aVwe ll procrastinate and we ll wait for things to happen
p326
aVand that s when we do 
p327
aVand when we talked to students
p328
aVthey say that  this is the way we know how to work 
p329
aVthis is the way we are trained 
p330
aVand related this many of them say that fear of failure
p331
aVsometimes motivates them 
p332
aVand they say that this is essential
p333
aVand this is how things have to happen 
p334
aVis that so that this is only way we can work
p335
aVor because it sometimes makes us feel very restricted 
p336
aVis there a way where we can be free of this 
p337
aV see  let s understand this in a more fundamental way 
p338
aVsee  when we say stress 
p339
aVwhen we say anxiety 
p340
aVwhen we say depression 
p341
aVwhen we say misery or
p342
aVwhen we say joy 
p343
aVwhen we say bliss 
p344
aVwhen we say ecstasy or love or whatever 
p345
aVall human experience comes from within you 
p346
aVis this so  all of you 
p347
aVi m asking for a higher opinion   
p348
aVis this so 
p349
aV yes 
p350
aV all human experience happens from within you 
p351
aVat least what happens from within you must happen the way you want it 
p352
ag232
aVnow you are still in a university 
p353
aVonce you step out into the larger world  tch 
p354
aVthis is a very protected world that you re living in 
p355
aVif this you re thinking sword is hanging on your head
p356
aVyou ll have a bomb ticking 
p357
aVonce you step out 
p358
aVthis is a very comfortable life 
p359
aVvery protected life 
p360
aVhere nothing is hanging on you 
p361
aVokay  yes 
p362
aVyou need to pass your examinations  whatever 
p363
aVthere are some challenges i m not saying no 
p364
aVbut all human experience happens from within 
p365
aVwhatever comes from within you
p366
aVcan i assume that you are doing it 
p367
aVif something sweet comes out of you right now can i assume you are saying something sweet 
p368
aVsomething nasty comes out of you can i assume you re saying it 
p369
ag350
aV or is it your ego  
p370
aV i think the ego then 
p371
aV because this has become the way of the world 
p372
aVpeople have found all kinds of fall guys  
p373
aVspiritual fall guys
p374
aVand civil fall guys 
p375
aVif they do something wonderful they say it s me 
p376
aVif they do something nasty they say it s that mr  ego 
p377
aVthat guy does this 
p378
aVif they do something wonderful in the world they say it s me 
p379
aVsomething go  little goes wrong in their life
p380
aVthey ll find one little guy here
p381
aVand say it s because of him 
p382
aVif something big goes wrong in their life
p383
aVthey ll find one big guy there and say it s because of him  
p384
aVthis  guy is missing 
p385
aVthis guy needs to come into the play 
p386
aVonly when this guy comes into play you call that life 
p387
aVyes 
p388
aVwhen this guy play this is called life 
p389
aVif that guy plays i don t know what it means 
p390
aVthis guy plays 
p391
aVthis is rubbish 
p392
aVeverything that goes on in my life
p393
aVsomebody who can t stand up to me he s responsible 
p394
aVsomething big goes wrong in my life  he s responsible 
p395
aVthis one is missing 
p396
aVone who is missing
p397
aVhow can he experience life 
p398
aVhow can he create life 
p399
aVhow can he know life 
p400
aVso this guy has to come into play 
p401
aVso one important thing that needs to happen in the world today is
p402
aVwe have to move from religion to responsibility
p403
aVapplause
p404
aVwe have been slinking around with life 
p405
aVwhen things happen i m there
p406
aVwhen it don t happen  somewhere  somewhere 
p407
aVno 
p408
aVif you understand it s me who is causing anxiety to myself
p409
aVnot my examination 
p410
aVwhen i joined the institution i know there are going to be examinations  isn t it 
p411
aVwhat is causing anxiety is not something else 
p412
aVmy inability to handle my own thought and my emotion  isn t it 
p413
aVif it so happened
p414
aVyour left hand is free right now 
p415
aVyour left hand is free 
p416
aVsuppose it pops up and punches you in the face 
p417
aVwhat will you do   
p418
aVi will ask him to restrain the left hand  
p419
aVif it doesn t work
p420
aVwe ll ask them to tie it up 
p421
aVif it doesn t work at all 
p422
aVif it s going to pull out your eyeballs
p423
aVthen we may have to amputate it 
p424
ag232
aVright now that is all you re trying to do 
p425
aVto beat the anxiety you ll drown yourself in alcohol 
p426
aVto beat the anxiety you burn yourself down with smoke 
p427
aVwhat you re trying to do is
p428
aVamputate yourself
p429
aVbecause you don t know how to handle the potential of being human 
p430
aVyour problem is very evolutionary 
p431
aVwhen i say evolutionary 
p432
aVsee  do you know  
p433
aVi mean you re all engineering students
p434
aVso i m asking do you know
p435
aVdo you know the dna difference between you and a chimpanzee is only 1 23 percent 
p436
aV1 23 percent is not much of a difference  isn t it  
p437
ag232
aVphysiologically that is how close to a chimpanzee you are 
p438
aVbut in terms of your intelligence 
p439
aVintellect and awareness
p440
aVyou are worlds apart from a chimpanzee 
p441
aVor in other words
p442
aVyour intellect or this cerebral activities
p443
aVin evolutionary scale it s of recent origin 
p444
aVit s new 
p445
aVyou ve still not learned how to deal with it 
p446
aVyou have an intelligence
p447
aVfor which you don t have a stable enough base 
p448
aVthe only and only reason
p449
aVyou suffer either misery or anxiety or depression or whatever  
p450
aVthis may sound very cruel to you
p451
aVbut the reality is this 
p452
aVthat your own intelligence has turned against you 
p453
aVit is like you ve been given a sharp knife 
p454
aVyou don t know how to handle it 
p455
aVevery day you keep cutting yourself
p456
aVand you think there is something wrong with the knife 
p457
ag408
aVyou don t have steady hand 
p458
aVif your intelligence worked for you one hundred percent
p459
aVwould you create blissfulness or misery for yourself 
p460
aVjoy or misery
p461
aVplease chose right now
p462
aVi m going to bless you  
p463
aV joy 
p464
aV for yourself you clearly know
p465
aVhighest level of pleasantness is what you want 
p466
aVwhat you want for your neighbor is debatable 
p467
aVwhat you want for yourself is very  very clear  isn t it 
p468
aVso you create ghosts of you own
p469
aVand try to fight them 
p470
aVcan i tell you a joke 
p471
aVyou okay  
p472
aVno  because you re from delhi i m asking you  
p473
aVan indian man
p474
aVprobably from an iit 
p475
aVwent to united states
p476
aVof course as a technology person to start with 
p477
aVthen he started dabbling with some investments 
p478
aVthen he started playing the stock market 
p479
aVin 1996 i think 
p480
aVfour or six i m not sure 
p481
aVin one of those years he had a windfall in the american stock market 
p482
aVthat year he earned the highest amount of money on the us stock market
p483
aVwhich is not a small amount 
p484
aVit s a huge sum 
p485
aVhe was already over sixty years of age 
p486
aVjust the previous year he was divorced  
p487
aVtimely divorced it happened
p488
aVbecause in california law
p489
aVyou have to share fifty percent with the wife 
p490
aVjust one year ahead of this windfall the wife had left him
p491
ag260
aVand he wanted to spend this money upon himself
p492
aVso he bought himself a 1932 ferrari
p493
aVfor thirty six million dollars 
p494
aVhe bought a beverly hills home for eighty million dollars 
p495
aVthen he was over sixty 
p496
aVhe wants to live long
p497
aVso he thought he needs a medical checkup 
p498
aVin northern california
p499
aVthere are medical institutions which are swankier than seven star hotels
p500
aVand you can go there 
p501
aVnot some dreary medical checkup  in one day  everything 
p502
aVfifteen days you can get admitted for a fortnight
p503
aVand you can choose your tests unlike you 
p504
aVyou can t choose your tests  
p505
aVyou can choose your tests 
p506
aVall kinds of esoteric tests are there 
p507
aVyou can choose what kind of tests you want to go through 
p508
aVso the entire space was nice 
p509
aVthe appointed a very pretty looking young woman to take care of him 
p510
aVhe was enjoying the entire process 
p511
aVon the fourth day he was feeling very relaxed in the evening
p512
aVand he was lying on his bed 
p513
aVunfortunately what should happen in the toilet
p514
aVhappened upon the bed 
p515
aVhe felt very embarrassed
p516
aVand he did not know how to handle this mess 
p517
aVnot knowing how to hand this mess
p518
aVhe was just looking how to do this 
p519
aVjust then he heard this young woman coming towards the room 
p520
aVin america fortunately
p521
aVyoung ladies don t
p522
aVcannot walk quietly 
p523
aVthey walk tok  tok  tok  tok  
p524
aVso when he heard this tok  tok  tok 
p525
aVshe knows  he knows she is coming 
p526
aVhe does not want this young lady to see the mess on the bed 
p527
aVso he just gathered all the hospital white sheets
p528
aVand threw it out of the fifth floor window 
p529
aVdown below a regular man was going home from a party
p530
ag260
aVand it s such an unfair world 
p531
aVbecause a man is expected to walk on a round planet
p532
aVand the damn thing is spinning all the time 
p533
aVthis you realize only when you have had a few m  few drops too many or
p534
aVfew drops between your ears are gone  
p535
aVso he was walking sideways and slowly finding his way home 
p536
aVthen these sheets came and covered him  
p537
aVthen he screamed and yelled and fought with these sheets 
p538
aVit took him over two minutes to get the sheets down 
p539
aVthen the sheets got down and he was looking at the sheets dazed 
p540
aVthe security arrived hearing all this commotion 
p541
aVthey said   what is all the commotion about 
p542
aVthe man said
p543
aVit looks like i ve beaten the shit out of a ghost 
p544
ag260
aVso it s your thought 
p545
aVwhat happens in your mind is your thought  isn t it 
p546
aVit s your emotion
p547
aVunfortunately 
p548
aVunfortunately our education systems from an early age
p549
aVhave not thought you this much 
p550
aVhow to handle your thought 
p551
aVhow to handle your emotion  tch 
p552
aVif you did not know how to handle your hands
p553
aVit would be a mess  isn t it 
p554
aVthis you will know if you come to tamil nadu 
p555
aVyou will suddenly realize
p556
aVtamil people can use their fingers far better than you 
p557
aVthat is  on a banana leaf they will put rice and rasam 
p558
aVyou will see it ll go all over the place 
p559
aVbut they won t let a drop go anywhere 
p560
aVin two minutes it ll be dry
p561
aVjust with their fingers  
p562
aVso everybody can get to use
p563
aVwhat they have much better
p564
aVthan the way they re handling it right now  isn t it 
p565
aVif you knew how to handle your thought and emotion
p566
aVwould you think anxiety is a problem 
p567
aVwould you think stress is a problem 
p568
aVtension is a problem 
p569
aVwould you think such things would exist for you 
p570
aVso essentially it is our inability to handle our own thought process 
p571
aVour own emotions
p572
aVthat all this is happening 
p573
aVinstead of learning to handle it
p574
aVwe are giving labels to all our inabilities 
p575
aVall kinds of exotic titles for ourselves 
p576
ag408
aVthis is not the way to go about it 
p577
aVi am telling you this is the easiest part of your life 
p578
aVbeing in a protected institution like this 
p579
aVgetting the best of academics
p580
aVand you just have to pass an examination 
p581
aVthat s all 
p582
aVonce you step out it s another game  
p583
aV you said that this is the easiest part of your life as a student
p584
aVbut we see that a lot of youngsters fall into the clutches of stress 
p585
aVdepression
p586
aVand to cope with that they go to the addictions like alcohol  drug  porn  internet etcetera
p587
aVand they think that it will give them relief 
p588
aV i didn t know internet was along with the drugs  
p589
aV so how to deal with them 
p590
aV look at me  i m always stoned
p591
ag260
aVnever been on a substance
p592
aVbut you must understand
p593
aVwhatever stimulants
p594
aVwhatever stimulus you may take from outside
p595
aVessentially human experience of all kinds
p596
aVis caused only from within 
p597
aVthe question is only
p598
aVare you on push start or are you on self start 
p599
aVwhich is better technologically 
p600
aV self start 
p601
ag601
aVso if i teach you 
p602
aVsuppose i teach you
p603
aVthat you can simple sit here and be totally blissed out 
p604
aVmore stoned than anybody on the campus  
p605
aVat the same time you re fully aware 
p606
aVwould you go for it 
p607
aVhmm 
p608
ag607
aVfully stoned 
p609
aVfully conscious 
p610
ag607
ag350
aV see the only problem with your alcohol  drugs  everything
p611
aVis not a moral issue 
p612
aVit is a life issue because it destroys life 
p613
aVit s not a morality that
p614
aVthis is good  this is bad  that s not the point 
p615
aVthe point is it makes you incapable in so many ways 
p616
aVthere was a certain israeli scientist
p617
aVwho was researching on marijuana or cannabis 
p618
aVover eighteen years
p619
aVthe us drug and  drug administration gave him large quantities of marijuana
p620
aVand he went on experimenting and eighteen years  time
p621
aVhe came up with really nothing significant
p622
aVand during mid eighties when american agencies were fighting drug on the street 
p623
aVthey changed their policy of
p624
aVfighting the suppliers in mexico and south america 
p625
aVthey decided to fight on the street
p626
aVwith the users 
p627
aVso they said
p628
aVsomebody said this is not right 
p629
aVyou re giving this man such a big stock 
p630
aVwe don t know what he is doing
p631
aVbecause he had not produced anything 
p632
aVeighteen years of research 
p633
aVthen he moved to israel 
p634
aVthe israeli government looked at his work
p635
aVand they decided to give him
p636
aVbig stocks of marijuana 
p637
aVand after another three and a half  four years he came up with this 
p638
aVhe found that in the human brain
p639
aVthere are millions of cannabis receptors 
p640
aVthen he threw this question to various disciplines 
p641
aVanthropologist tried to look at it and say
p642
aVat some time in history
p643
aVmaybe every human being was smoking that s why the receptors 
p644
aVthen they said this is rubbish
p645
aVbecause in many parts of the world it was not there 
p646
aVeven a eskimo has cannabis receptors
p647
aVwhere he has never seen anything like this 
p648
aVthen various things happened
p649
aVthen the neurologists came up with this 
p650
aVthey said always the human brain is waiting for the cannabis 
p651
aVthat which causes intoxication 
p652
aVnot waiting for it from outside 
p653
aVit can generate from within
p654
aVthat is why there are receptors 
p655
aVso this is something that we have always known 
p656
aVi can show you  
p657
aVi m there always
p658
aVbut you look at my eyes 
p659
aVi m always stoned
p660
aVbut as aware as anybody can be 
p661
aVif you do not know intoxication in life
p662
aVyou will never know a sense of abandon 
p663
aVif you don t have a sense of abandon
p664
aVyou will never walk full stride in your life 
p665
aVyou will only walk half steps all the time 
p666
aVonly when there is no fear of suffering
p667
aVbecause you re highly intoxicated and fully aware
p668
aVnot because you consumed substances
p669
aVwhich will take away your awareness 
p670
aVsimply because you re keeping the system 
p671
aVthe human mechanism at its highest function 
p672
aVnow it is fully self sufficient 
p673
aVblissed out all the time 
p674
aVnow you will not think of all these things 
p675
aVi m
p676
aVi want you to look all young people 
p677
aVi want you to look at this 
p678
aVin your life would you like to do that which works
p679
aVor that which does not work 
p680
ag608
aV multiple answers
p681
aV human intelligence is always looking for that which works  isn t it 
p682
aVthat which does not work is not what we re interested in 
p683
aVthat which works 
p684
aVwhen  i m  i m just wondering
p685
aVhow far to take you 
p686
aVyou look like a nice boy  
p687
aVthis is
p688
aVit is just this 
p689
aVevery experience 
p690
aVwhatever happens to you  
p691
aVright now let s look at it this way 
p692
aVright now all of you 
p693
aVthose who are in the upper regions also 
p694
aVdo you see me 
p695
ag350
aV even if you re not listening 
p696
aVdo you see me  
p697
ag350
aV if you see me
p698
aVcan you use one of your hands and point out where i am 
p699
aVtch  tch  tch 
p700
aVyou also 
p701
aVoh  you got it wrong 
p702
aVyou know i m a mystic 
p703
aVfrom southern india  
p704
aVso today you know this light is falling upon me 
p705
aVreflecting  going through your lenses 
p706
aVinverted image in the retina 
p707
aVyou know the entire story  isn t it 
p708
aVso you see me within yourself 
p709
aVyou hear me within yourself 
p710
aVwhere have you seen the whole world 
p711
aVwithin yourself 
p712
aVthe way it is projected in the firmament of your mind
p713
aVyou are not seeing the world it is 
p714
aVyou are saying it the way it s projected within you 
p715
aVa grasshopper may not be seeing the world the way you see it 
p716
aVhe is seeing it differently 
p717
ag232
aVsame world but he sees  sees it differently
p718
aVbecause his visual apparatus are made completely different 
p719
aVyou know that different animals hear 
p720
aVsome hear subsonic sound 
p721
aVsome hear ultrasonic sound 
p722
aVwe  we don t hear both of them 
p723
ag388
aVwe hear something else 
p724
aVso we are all living in the same world
p725
aVbut seeing and hearing things completely differently 
p726
aVwhat is day for us 
p727
aVwhat is light for us is darkness for some other creature 
p728
aVwhat is darkness for them is light for us 
p729
aVobviously our instruments of perception
p730
aVare created for our survival process
p731
aVand their instruments for survival are crafted for their survival process
p732
aVbut now your intelligence has blossomed to a place
p733
aVwhere survival is not good enough 
p734
aVyou want to know the nature of life 
p735
aVonce this longing comes
p736
aVthen you must understand
p737
aVthe instruments of perception need to be in enhanced 
p738
aVthese instruments
p739
aVfive senses of seeing  hearing  smelling  tasting and touching 
p740
aVthey are not good enough
p741
aVbecause they are only instruments of survival 
p742
aVthey are not instruments of true knowing
p743
aVbecause they show you everything in comparison 
p744
aVwhen i say everything in comparison 
p745
aVright now if you re six feet tall 
p746
aVyou stand like a tall man 
p747
aVyou walk like a tall man 
p748
aVyou think like a tall man 
p749
aVyou are a tall man 
p750
aVyou went to another society where everybody is eight feet tall 
p751
aVsuddenly you stand like a short man 
p752
aVwalk like a short man  think like a short man 
p753
aVyou are a short man  isn t it  
p754
aVi m saying what you know in comparison is only good for survival process not to know the nature of life 
p755
aVso right now everything that you know is only by comparison 
p756
aVif i touch this i feel it s cool 
p757
aVno  that s not the reality 
p758
aVthe reality is because my body temperature is in a certain way
p759
aVi make a judgment that this is cool 
p760
aVsuppose i lower my body temperature substantially
p761
aVand then i touch this 
p762
aVthis would be warm to me 
p763
ag232
aVso what you re perceiving is only by comparison 
p764
aVwhat you know by comparison is just a distortion of reality 
p765
aVit is good enough for survival 
p766
aVit is not good enough to know the nature of life 
p767
aVnow you re talking about stress and anxiety
p768
aVas i said
p769
aVevery year we ve been trekking in himalayas 
p770
aVtwo years ago
p771
aVi m in a tent somewhere in nepal
p772
aVand i m doing some work 
p773
aVsomeone else is cutting an apple  
p774
aVthere s another person in the tent 
p775
aVthat person tells this person 
p776
aV be careful  it s a very sharp knife 
p777
aVit irritates me
p778
aVbecause i call something a knife only if it s sharp 
p779
aVwhat about you  
p780
aVi call something as knife only if it s really sharp otherwise
p781
aVi will call it a screw driver  
p782
aVi look at this and then i continue my work 
p783
aVand another two minutes
p784
aVagain it is said 
p785
ag777
aVi say  come on  leave the man alone 
p786
aVif it s a child yes  but this is full grown man 
p787
aVhe knows how to handle a knife 
p788
aVnot a complicated machinery 
p789
aV no  sadhguru  it s a very sharp knife   
p790
aVthen i continued my work 
p791
aVanother two minutes i hear a whisper 
p792
aV be careful  it s a very sharp knife   
p793
aVanother two minutes he cuts his hand 
p794
aVthen i give up  
p795
aVwhy i m saying this to you is knife is not a sharp instrument 
p796
aVa knife is not dangerous instrument 
p797
aVevery day in the world
p798
aVboth in terms of kitchens and operation theaters
p799
aVtell me are knifves saving more lives or taking more lives 
p800
aVsaving more lives 
p801
aVin an irresponsible hand it may take somebody s life 
p802
aVknife is not dangerous 
p803
aVit is in whose hands it is 
p804
aVwhat kind of hand is it which makes it dangerous 
p805
aVknife is not a dangerous instrument 
p806
ag232
aVonly if an unsteady hand is handling 
p807
aVif a child holds a knife 
p808
aVwe say  be careful  be careful
p809
aVbecause not because knife is dangerous
p810
aVbecause the hand is not steady 
p811
aVright now this is the situation 
p812
aVcompared to every other creature on the planet
p813
aVyour intellect is little sharper than them  
p814
aVwould you like to have a sharp intellect or a dull one 
p815
aV sharp 
p816
ag816
aVif you want a sharp intellect you must learn to hold it right otherwise
p817
aVevery day you start poking 
p818
aVthis is self help   you know 
p819
aVwhen was the last time somebody stabbed you with a dagger in the 
p820
aVwhen was the last time somebody stabbed you with a dagger  
p821
aVeven in delhi it doesn t happen  
p822
aVmaybe somebody poked you with a pin at the most when you were in school 
p823
aVor maybe they ignored you 
p824
aVthey did not even do that  
p825
aVso what i m saying is
p826
aVhow much suffering is actually coming from outside 
p827
aVminiscule  isn t it 
p828
aVrest is all self help 
p829
aVso once your intelligence turns against you 
p830
aVbelieve me no force in the universe can save you 
p831
aVso it s very important
p832
aVbefore you do anything else in your life
p833
aVyou learn to bring your body and mind to a state
p834
aVwhere your body take instructions from you 
p835
aVyour mind takes instructions from you 
p836
aVthey must serve you 
p837
aVyou should not be serving them 
p838
aVotherwise you will live a very poor life 
p839
aVvery poor life
p840
aVbecause you can only live a life of some significance
p841
aVonly when your mind and your body works for you
p842
aVnot against you  isn t it 
p843
aVat least this much every human being should take charge of 
p844
aV sadhguru  i speak to my friends around here
p845
aVand whenever we talk about meditation or yoga 
p846
aVthey say   ah  that s for the old people 
p847
aVthat s not for us
p848
aVand we re not very interested in it 
p849
aVand one of my friends said 
p850
aV i tried meditating and i slept 
p851
aVso why is it that meditation and yoga is perceived
p852
aVas something for the old and not for the young generation 
p853
aV we don t need this 
p854
aV maybe because
p855
aVthat is the kind of people they have met 
p856
aVin the sense
p857
aVyoga means they saw all yogis
p858
aVwho fell out of the calendars 
p859
aVprinted in shiva kashi  you know  in south india
p860
ag260
aVall right 
p861
aVthey thought yoga means you re not interested in life 
p862
aVthat s a general thing 
p863
aVi am doing everything possible to change this perception 
p864
aVmany things 
p865
aVthis is not for anything
p866
aVbecause you re young people i m saying 
p867
aVsomething physical you learn 
p868
aVlet s say you learn to ride a dirt bike 
p869
aVlet s say you learn to do sky diving 
p870
aVlet s say you learn to fly a helicopter 
p871
aVlet s say you learn to ski 
p872
aVdo something 
p873
aVwhat you may take three years or five years to learn
p874
aVi will do it in three months at this age 
p875
aVwould you like to do that at an early age
p876
aVor when you re dying 
p877
aVi m asking you 
p878
aV early age 
p879
aV then you must do yoga   
p880
aVi will tell you
p881
aVi got into yoga for all the wrong reasons 
p882
aVbut that is the beauty of life 
p883
aVeven for wrong reasons if you do the right thing it works 
p884
aVi was just eleven  twelve years of age 
p885
aVevery summer vacation
p886
aVwe go to our grandfather s ancestral home
p887
aVwhere in the backyard there is a well
p888
aVwhich is about eight feet in diameter 
p889
aVabout hundred and fifty feet in depth 
p890
aVwater generally in summer will be
p891
aVat least sixty  seventy feet below the ground level 
p892
aVso one of the sport for us young boys is to jump into this well and climb up 
p893
aVwhen you jump you have to go properly
p894
aVotherwise your brains will become a smear on the wall 
p895
aVand to come up there is no step 
p896
aVthere is no foothold  nothing 
p897
aVjust holding the rock you have to climb 
p898
aVi remember just the sheer pressure 
p899
aVmy weight
p900
aVi was not very heavy
p901
aVbut still my weight on just two fingers and three fingers like this 
p902
aVmy nails would bleed out of sheer pressure not injury
p903
aVjust hanging onto the rock like that with claws 
p904
aVbut i would do that
p905
aVand i m very proud that i m good at it 
p906
aVone day a man who is over seventy years age
p907
aVsimply standing there silently watching us 
p908
aVwe ignored him
p909
aVbecause seventy means for us he was dead  
p910
aVnot now  okay  
p911
aVperspective of life will change  you know  
p912
aVat that time seventy means he s gone 
p913
aVbut without a word
p914
aVthis man who was over seventy two years of age at that time 
p915
aVhe just walked to the well and jumped 
p916
aVi thought he s finished 
p917
aVbut he came up faster than me 
p918
aVi didn t like it 
p919
aVthen i asked 
p920
aVhow 
p921
aVhe said   come  do yoga 
p922
aVlike a puppy i went behind him  
p923
aVbecause i found him so super human
p924
aVthat he could do things that no young man could do 
p925
aVso i got into yoga for all the wrong reasons 
p926
aVsee it doesn t matter how you get in 
p927
aVwhich door you enter from it doesn t matter
p928
aVas long as you do the right thing it works 
p929
aVessentially what yoga means is this
p930
aVyou use a cell phone 
p931
aVwhat 
p932
aVsamsung 
p933
aViphone 
p934
aV yes  a samsung  
p935
aV tch  you didn t use the seven  
p936
aVso if you have a cellphone
p937
aVis it true or any gadget 
p938
aVthe more you know about it
p939
aVthe better you can use it 
p940
aVis it so 
p941
ag232
aVthat s what your entire engineering is about 
p942
aVto know more about everything
p943
aVso that you can use it better  make it better  isn t it 
p944
aVwhy is that not true with this 
p945
aVthe more you know about this 
p946
ag940
aVanyway of all the
p947
aVgadgets that you find on this planet
p948
aVis this 
p949
aVthe most sophisticated mechanism on the planet 
p950
aVdo you agree with me 
p951
aVif you don t agree with me then something wrong with you
p952
ag260
aVthis is the most sophisticated mechanism on the planet  isn t it 
p953
aVwhy is it that you have not paid attention
p954
aVas to see
p955
aVwhat are all the intricacies of what this is 
p956
aVwhat this means is
p957
aVyou haven t read the user s manual
p958
aVbut you want to blunder into the world 
p959
aVso just education is becoming stress 
p960
aVif you want to create something in the world
p961
aVyou will see so many more challenges 
p962
aVso education which is a simplest process of all 
p963
aVthat is becoming stress 
p964
aVthis is simply because
p965
aVyou have not read the user s manual at all 
p966
aVsimply   samsung 
p967
aVwe don t know what ll happen 
p968
aVyou must learn how to use it 
p969
aVsimilarly this  
p970
aVso if you know perfectly well how to use this
p971
aVthen we say you re self realized 
p972
aVself realized does not mean you went to heaven 
p973
aVyou know this  perfectly well 
p974
aVyou know everything  the range of things this can do 
p975
aVthis is all i know in my life 
p976
aVi know this piece of life from its origin to its ultimate 
p977
aVpeople think i know everything 
p978
aVthat s their problem 
p979
aVi know only this  
p980
aV so  there s a lot of talk about our country 
p981
aVindia these days 
p982
aVeven in the world platforms we see that the things are improving 
p983
aVbut going to the past of the india
p984
aVif we see the history of world s civilizations
p985
aVwe see that india particularly stands out very clearly
p986
aVwhen it comes to developing ways of
p987
aVthis self experiential ways of realizing this inner truth about ourselves
p988
aVor knowing the body and the higher truths through self experiential ways 
p989
aVso what do you think was it that
p990
aVwe were able to do properly that
p991
aVwe were able to discover these things
p992
aVand not just that 
p993
aVwe were not just able to discover
p994
aVbut also proliferate them into the social eco system 
p995
aVwhat was it that led us into this 
p996
aV essentially a long spell of peaceful  civilized life  
p997
aVa long spell 
p998
aVyou must understand this 
p999
aVthe reason why we got this long spell is
p1000
aVin the north we were protected by the himalayan ranges 
p1001
aVin the south by the indian ocean 
p1002
aVso this is himalaya 
p1003
aVthe indian ocean that we call today as the india ocean
p1004
aVat that time it was called as the indu sagara 
p1005
aVthis is why we took the identity  hi  and  du  hindu 
p1006
aVhindu is not a religion 
p1007
aVnot belief system 
p1008
aVnot a god oriented thing 
p1009
aVit is a geographical identity 
p1010
aVunfortunately it s turned into many things today
p1011
aVthat s a different thing 
p1012
aVso we identified with these two geographical features
p1013
aVbecause we realized
p1014
aVit s only because of these features that
p1015
aVwe had an undisturbed civilization growing
p1016
aVwithout any external agencies coming and disturbing us 
p1017
aVwhen there is a long spell for a human being
p1018
aVwhere he doesn t have to fight for his survival on a daily basis 
p1019
aVthat is when human genius flowers  
p1020
aVin many ways human genius flowered 
p1021
aVwe produced the greatest mathematician 
p1022
aVgreatest astronomers 
p1023
aVgreatest musicians 
p1024
aVall kinds of people
p1025
aVand many technologies which we refused to use
p1026
aVsimply because we foresaw if you go this way what will happen to the world 
p1027
aVvarious other things 
p1028
aVif you look back at the glorious history of this country
p1029
aVit is simply because  
p1030
aVwhich is true even today 
p1031
aVsee you can build a great society
p1032
aVor a great nation
p1033
aVor a great world
p1034
aVnot by talking about it 
p1035
aVonly by building individual human beings
p1036
aVwho are truly great 
p1037
aVwithout great human beings where is a great society 
p1038
aVsociety is just a word 
p1039
aVnation is just a word 
p1040
aVworld is just a world 
p1041
aVindividual human beings are the only reality 
p1042
aVwhat kind of people we are
p1043
aVthat s the kind of india we have  isn t it  
p1044
aVso the focus
p1045
aVright from ancient times in this country was always about individual development 
p1046
aVwe never
p1047
aVsee this is why the western commentators are missing the entire point 
p1048
aVthey don t  they think india never had a civilization because
p1049
aVwe never spoke about it 
p1050
aVwe refused to speak about society  about nation 
p1051
aVwe only spoke about individual development because
p1052
aVif you generate great individuals 
p1053
aVwe will naturally have a great society 
p1054
aVa great society is a consequence 
p1055
aVit is not the cause 
p1056
aVthe cause is great individuals 
p1057
aVso our focus was always on producing great human beings
p1058
aVnever on producing a great society or a nation 
p1059
aVthat happened as a consequence  
p1060
aV so do you think from ancient times till now
p1061
aVdo you think that things in india have changed 
p1062
aVso if they have
p1063
aVwhat brought us to the change we are in
p1064
aVand how do you see this development process of great individuals 
p1065
aVhow do you see that being manifested in the modern times 
p1066
aV and if i may add how can these ideas  
p1067
aVit s something that i m assuming that they are not so prevalent in
p1068
aV i m sorry  not 
p1069
aV i m assuming that these ideas of individual development focused on an individual
p1070
aVare not so prevalent in today s system
p1071
aV no  we ve gotten into mass production of everything  
p1072
aV yes  so how we actually bring them back
p1073
aVand how should india then  
p1074
aVif i ask a larger question  
p1075
aVhow should india as model of development 
p1076
aVis it just aping the west
p1077
aVor can we bring back those elements of individual development 
p1078
aV see  for anything to happen
p1079
aVyou need a certain ecosystem 
p1080
aVcertain economic  what to say 
p1081
aVa certain economic depth to  for people to be able to do it 
p1082
ag999
aVthe generation that we were growing up 
p1083
aVour parents were just crazy that
p1084
aVyou must somehow get one degree and get into a government job 
p1085
aVyour parents are not doing that 
p1086
aVthey are thinking little more easy 
p1087
aVthey are trying to explore things 
p1088
aVthey want you to do a startup 
p1089
aVthey want you to do a business 
p1090
aVthey want you to get into sport 
p1091
aVthis was never there 
p1092
aVthey were just saying get a job somehow
p1093
aVotherwise you ll be on the street 
p1094
aVthis was the level of economics of the time 
p1095
aVtoday there is a little more economic space
p1096
aVwhere parents are looking at their children little differently 
p1097
aVstill we are little compressed in the heads
p1098
aVbut little more ease than what it was forty  fifty years ago 
p1099
aVask all your professors 
p1100
aVthey were just pushed  pushed  get a job  get a job first thing 
p1101
aVtoday your parents are not looking like that 
p1102
aVlooking at what can you create 
p1103
aVwhat can i  our children can create 
p1104
aVwhat can they live 
p1105
aVhow about their happiness  
p1106
aVnobody ever thought about our happiness  okay  
p1107
aVso it needs a certain economic depth for any society
p1108
aVto experiment 
p1109
aVto have little more freedom to do things
p1110
aVotherwise putting them through the extruder
p1111
aVand getting them out in some form in which they re useful 
p1112
aVthis is what the society will do 
p1113
aVthis is a natural consequence of
p1114
aVfifteen  twenty generations of extreme poverty 
p1115
ag688
aVthis mental structure and this economic structure
p1116
aVis a consequence of fifteen to twenty generations of extreme poverty 
p1117
aVvery bad poverty means
p1118
aVindia has suffered poverty like nobody else 
p1119
aVpeople may show  you know  pictures of africa and stuff 
p1120
aVyou must know this 
p1121
aVin africa there have been famines 
p1122
aVthere have been wars 
p1123
aVunnecessary wars and tribal wars which have caused this in small scale 
p1124
aVin india the level of malnourishment and poverty
p1125
aVthat s happened in the last two centuries is most painful 
p1126
aVno other nation on the planet has suffered as much as this country 
p1127
aVno other country has lost as many people
p1128
aVas we have lost in the last century just for hunger and lack of nourishment 
p1129
aVeven today it is true
p1130
aVthough we are much better 
p1131
aVeven today unfortunately it is true
p1132
aVthat we have the highest number of malnourished people in the country 
p1133
aVmore than sixty percent of the rural population
p1134
aVeven today 
p1135
aVthey have not grown
p1136
aVtheir skeletal system has not grown to full size 
p1137
aVwhen they are in that state
p1138
aVyou re only thinking how to make a living 
p1139
aVyou re not thinking of how to open up human genius 
p1140
aVyou re not interested in all that 
p1141
aVyou re not thinking how to become self realized 
p1142
ag1139
aVso this has happened to us because we ve been an occupied nation for too long 
p1143
aVwe ve been ripped off in every other way 
p1144
aVthere s no point blaming somebody 
p1145
aVwe didn t take care of it at that time 
p1146
aVit went out of our hands
p1147
aVbut two hundred fifty  three hundred years ago everybody wanted to come to india 
p1148
aVwhy 
p1149
aVbecause it was the richest country on the planet 
p1150
aVwe occupied a thirty three percent space
p1151
aVin the economic space of the planet at one time 
p1152
aVtoday probably we are two or three percent 
p1153
ag608
aVso because of this extreme poverty
p1154
aVwe have a certain mindset
p1155
aVbut i think in a generation or in next fifteen  twenty years
p1156
aVa whole lot of people will come out of this
p1157
aVbecause there s little more ease 
p1158
aVlittle more space to play with 
p1159
aVlittle more space to push it 
p1160
aVso as a part of this
p1161
aVwe are creating this space in many ways 
p1162
aVwe have three types of education 
p1163
aVyou know in isha 
p1164
aVwe have what s called as isha vidya which is in rural india
p1165
aVwhich includes our own schools
p1166
aVwhich are mainly focused towards teaching english language  computer sciences 
p1167
aVregular academic education at a certain level 
p1168
aVbring discipline and well being  health and well being 
p1169
aVnourishment which is most important in the villages
p1170
aVand get them out of the village
p1171
aVbecause to get out of that economic and social pit in which they are
p1172
aVeducation is just a passport for them 
p1173
aVthat s one level of education 
p1174
aVanother level of education we have
p1175
aVwhat s called as isha home school 
p1176
aVthis is for the little more affluent people 
p1177
aVthis happens inside the yoga center itself 
p1178
aVwe have a huge track of land and various facilities 
p1179
aVthese schools are run in a certain way 
p1180
aVtwenty children live with two dedicated house parents
p1181
aVand everything 
p1182
aVthe school itself is inside the house 
p1183
aVthat s why it s called a home school 
p1184
aVonly for playground  laboratory and libraries they go out 
p1185
aVeverything is inside the house 
p1186
aVthis turns out expensive
p1187
aVan expensive way of delivering education
p1188
aVbut this is done by dedicated people 
p1189
aVas a rule we never take any trained teachers 
p1190
aVwe have doctors  engineers  accountants 
p1191
aVall kinds of people but no trained teachers because
p1192
aVwe want education to happen as an inspiration
p1193
aVnot as putting  you know 
p1194
aVshoving down information down somebody s throat 
p1195
aVas an inspiration
p1196
aVchildren should get the spark of wanting to know something 
p1197
aVthere is a whole range of activity of theatre 
p1198
aVart 
p1199
aVmusic 
p1200
aVsport 
p1201
aVall kinds of things 
p1202
aVmany of our  i mean
p1203
aVtwo  three of our boys are now in professional football in germany 
p1204
aVso like this they are going into various things 
p1205
aVthis school gives an enormous range of things 
p1206
aVand i made this now 
p1207
aVeleventh  twelfth i made it three years 
p1208
aVnot two years  three years i said one year extra
p1209
aVbecause by the time they got
p1210
aVget to eleventh a whole lot of parents will get marks mad 
p1211
aVwe have invested so much time in music  theatre and many  many things 
p1212
aVnow eleventh standard comes and everything is dropped
p1213
aVand they just start doing only  trying to get marks 
p1214
aVso i said three years 
p1215
aVif you want you stay otherwise no 
p1216
aVthe surprising thing is nobody wants to withdraw their children 
p1217
aVthis wouldn t have happened twenty five years ago 
p1218
aVeverybody would have withdrawn their children 
p1219
aVnow nobody wants to be 
p1220
aVnot even one child wants to be withdrawn 
p1221
aVeverybody wants to go three years for two years 
p1222
aVjust as an experiment i announced this  
p1223
aVeverybody is taking to it 
p1224
aVthe idea is  see  indians  wherever i go 
p1225
aVwhat i see is  they are in the best jobs 
p1226
aVthey're earning well  they're highly qualified 
p1227
aVbut they can't sing 
p1228
aVthey can't dance 
p1229
aVthey can't paint 
p1230
aVthey can't do any damn thing except going to work 
p1231
aVreally  this' an unfortunate thing  
p1232
aVthere's no life  
p1233
aVso  i thought we must invest enough in the children
p1234
aVbefore they get into professional colleges 
p1235
aVwe have to invest enough in their art  music  sport 
p1236
aVvariety of interests 
p1237
aVthey must explore many things 
p1238
aVthere's another school which we call as isha samskriti 
p1239
aVhere  if any child enters
p1240
aVcompulsory they must stay with us  as a commitment  for twelve years 
p1241
aVonly with that commitment we take the children 
p1242
aVhere there's no academics 
p1243
aVthey learn only yoga 
p1244
aVkalaripayattu  which is the mother of all martial arts 
p1245
aVhave you seen kalaripayattu  kerala 
p1246
aV   
p1247
ag350
aVkalaripayattu 
p1248
aVclassical dance 
p1249
aVclassical music 
p1250
aVsamskrit language and english language 
p1251
aVthis is all they learn 
p1252
aVyou must see these children 
p1253
aVyou won't believe 
p1254
aVthey are a different set of human beings all together 
p1255
aVhere  the focus is just this  
p1256
aVdeveloping human body and human brain to its fullest without a purpose 
p1257
aVi'm doing this because this is how i grew up 
p1258
aVi grew up without a purpose 
p1259
aVmy father beat his head and say 
p1260
aV what will this boy do 
p1261
aVhe's not getting qualified for anything 
p1262
aVso i would say   if i am not qualified for anything 
p1263
aVi can do just about everything   
p1264
aVso   these children are growing up in such a way 
p1265
aVmost amazing 
p1266
aVyou won't believe it unless you see it 
p1267
aVi'm  just to tell you an experience 
p1268
aVfrom age of six to eighteen they are with us 
p1269
aVafter that  if they wish  they can stay 
p1270
aVotherwise  they can go out and do what they want to do 
p1271
aVthere are many things that they can do which we are supporting them to do 
p1272
aVfrom fifteen to eighteen they become monks for three years
p1273
aV  extreme discipline and focus 
p1274
aVvery serious practices 
p1275
aVso before i initiate
p1276
aVthis  compulsory they have to come out at eighteen 
p1277
aVwe  they cannot choose to be monks 
p1278
aVthey have to come out at eighteen
p1279
aVbecause this
p1280
aVwe have allowed  we have made them go into it as children 
p1281
aVwhen they become adults  they must come out of it 
p1282
aVthere is  they cannot choose to continue 
p1283
aVso  first batch i wanted to initiate 
p1284
aVnow another is coming now in july  the third one 
p1285
aVthe first batch  when i went to initiate about three years ago  
p1286
aVsixty days 
p1287
aVfifteen year old children 
p1288
aVthey have been on sixty days of silence 
p1289
aV30 in the evening 
p1290
aVthey are in some kind of yogic sadhana 
p1291
aVminimum of eight hours they're keeping their eyes closed and sitting  okay 
p1292
aVjust another four days are left for the initiation 
p1293
aVi want to see how these boys and girls are doing
p1294
aV  fourteen of them in the first batch 
p1295
aV30 
p1296
aVi went and sat in the room 
p1297
aVthese eight boys and six girls were sitting there  
p1298
aVi'll never forget this in my life  
p1299
aVthey were just sitting there like that 
p1300
aVbelieve me 
p1301
aVthey were literally glowing 
p1302
aVi sat there and wept
p1303
aVbecause i've never seen children like this in my life 
p1304
aVi was not like this when i was fifteen  for sure 
p1305
aVthey are beyond anything that you can think of
p1306
aVsimply because they are focused
p1307
aVin developing the human mechanism to its fullest 
p1308
aVnot about how to earn my living 
p1309
aVthis' not the question 
p1310
aVwhen a earthworm 
p1311
aVwith one millionth of your brain can earn a living 
p1312
aVwith such a big brain  earning a living 
p1313
aVis it such a big problem 
p1314
aVit is the most
p1315
aVit's the grossest way to approach life is  
p1316
aVhow will i earn my living 
p1317
aVeverybody can earn their living 
p1318
aVthe only problem comes in your life
p1319
aVwhen you want to live like somebody else 
p1320
aVthat's a problem 
p1321
aVbut earning a living is not a problem 
p1322
aVif you just make what is considered survival minimal 
p1323
aVdon't go on exaggerating it 
p1324
aVthen you will see you have a whole lot of time and opportunity
p1325
aVto create what you want in your life 
p1326
aVbut people keep on raising the bar of survival
p1327
aVso much that they will not get to do anything in their life except surviving 
p1328
aVin the end  they don't know why they survived  
p1329
aV so i think there's a lot of curiosity in the audience also building up 
p1330
aVso unless you have some general comments to make 
p1331
aVwe can open the floor to the audience 
p1332
aV tch  you're all engineers
p1333
aVoh  they're disarming you  
p1334
aVwe must understand this  
p1335
aVengineering means 
p1336
aVessentially  to make things happen the way we want it 
p1337
aVthat's engineering  isn't it 
p1338
aVto engineer this building means what 
p1339
aVwe want it the way we want it 
p1340
aVwe could have sat under a tree 
p1341
aVbut we choose to build this building because
p1342
aVwe want to sit under something
p1343
aVengineered the way we want it 
p1344
aVas suitable for us 
p1345
aVwe air conditioned the place
p1346
aVbecause we want the temperature in a certain way 
p1347
aVall this we did 
p1348
aVbut it is not important that you engineer this 
p1349
aVthe way you want it  hello 
p1350
ag350
aV outside is air conditioned 
p1351
aVinside is boiling  
p1352
aVwhat's the point 
p1353
aV i'm saying power is being wasted on you  
p1354
aVin the last hundred  hundred and fifty years
p1355
aVwith the advent of science and technology  we have more comforts and conveniences than any generation
p1356
aVever could imagine  isn't it 
p1357
ag232
ag350
aV i'm looking for a higher opinion again  
p1358
aVyou have more comforts and conveniences
p1359
aVthan any generation could ever imagine 
p1360
aVwe are the most comfortable generation ever 
p1361
aVphysically  materially 
p1362
aVbut can you say are you the most peaceful generation 
p1363
aVjoyful 
p1364
aVloving 
p1365
ag408
aVor can you even say you're the most intelligent generation 
p1366
aVthat'll be a wrong thing to say 
p1367
aVanybody who claims he is intelligent amounts to foolishness  isn't it 
p1368
aVbecause the significance of intelligence is 
p1369
aVit shows you
p1370
aVhow many loopholes are there in your intelligence 
p1371
aVonly a fool thinks there are no loopholes 
p1372
aVa truly intelligent person always sees
p1373
aVhow many loopholes in my intelligence 
p1374
aVthe significance of being in a technological institute
p1375
aVis not about just getting qualified to get some job somewhere
p1376
aVor a passport out of the country 
p1377
aVit should become a way of creating life 
p1378
aVmaking life happen better than the way it's happening right now
p1379
aVbecause this is the fundamental responsibility that we have
p1380
aVas a generation of people
p1381
aVbecause we occupy this space on the planet for a short  brief time 
p1382
aVwhen the last generation gave this planet to us 
p1383
aVwhichever way they gave it 
p1384
aVit's our business that when we leave it 
p1385
aVwe leave it little better than the way we had it  
p1386
aVvery important 
p1387
aVhow better 
p1388
aVin what way better 
p1389
aVyou can decide that 
p1390
aVi won't say only ecologically better 
p1391
aVbut in every way better 
p1392
aVit must be better than the way we got it 
p1393
aVthis means we have to engineer ourselves
p1394
aVto fit in such a way
p1395
aVsee  a well engineered machine means
p1396
aVleast amount of friction  isn't it so 
p1397
ag388
aVa well engineered machine means what 
p1398
aVleast amount of friction 
p1399
aVheavy friction means badly engineered  isn't it 
p1400
aVisn't that the understanding 
p1401
aVso the fundamentals of yoga is this  
p1402
aVthe fundamentals of yoga is
p1403
aVin the geometry of physical existence 
p1404
aVif you understand the geometry of what this human mechanism is 
p1405
aVthe body is 
p1406
aVthe psychological structure is 
p1407
aVthe chemical processes are 
p1408
aVthe energy structures are 
p1409
aVif you understand the geometry of this 
p1410
aVand become capable of observing the cosmic geometry 
p1411
aVif these two things are well aligned 
p1412
aVsuddenly your life hits off like a magic 
p1413
aVyour life is no more
p1414
aVa miserable drag 
p1415
aVbut it's magical
p1416
aVsimply because you have gotten the right geometry of things 
p1417
aVanything that is geometrically perfect
p1418
aVwill function absolutely smoothly
p1419
aVand for a very long time 
p1420
aVthis is something that you must do to yourself
p1421
aVwhen you're young 
p1422
aVit doesn t matter what you want to do in your life 
p1423
aVone thing must happen  
p1424
aVyour body and your brain should not come in your way 
p1425
aVthey must work for you 
p1426
ag232
aVhello 
p1427
ag350
aV never your body and your mind should not come
p1428
aVin the way of who you want to be 
p1429
aVright now  for most people 
p1430
aVthey themselves are a big issue 
p1431
aVwhen you are a issue 
p1432
aVhow will you address the issues in the world 
p1433
aVif you really want to address the issues in the world 
p1434
aVthis one  should never be a issue  isn't it 
p1435
aV i am not the issue here  i am never the problem 
p1436
aVif there are problems  i will deal with it 
p1437
aVbut i am never the problem   
p1438
aVthis must happen to you  isn't it 
p1439
aVplease make yourself like this 
p1440
aVthat you are never the problem 
p1441
aVyou're always a part of the solution 
p1442
aVnever a part of the problem 
p1443
aVright now 
p1444
aVright now we have developed a certain attitude in the country 
p1445
aVa whole lot of people 
p1446
aVfor every solution they invent a problem  
p1447
aVfor every solution they have found a problem 
p1448
aVso there are people who are working for problems 
p1449
aVthere are people who are working for solutions 
p1450
aVyoung people should stand up
p1451
aVand become a solution for future generations to come
p1452
aVand your own life to blossom 
p1453
aVbecause the greatest fulfillment in one's life is
p1454
aVthat you functioned in such a way
p1455
aVthat you could do something which is much larger than yourself 
p1456
aVthis must happen 
p1457
aVthis is the highest fulfillment of activity  
p1458
aVthat you are able to do something
p1459
aVwhich is larger than yourself 
p1460
aVonly then 
p1461
aVyou will see fulfilment in activity 
p1462
aVactivity is one thing 
p1463
aVbut most important thing is how you are 
p1464
aVpeople come to me right
p1465
aVright now you're all saying you're iit is the problem 
p1466
aVso i'm inviting you to iyc  
p1467
aVit's isha yoga center

aVnone of these tormenters are there 
p1491
aVjust be joyful 
p1492
aVtwenty four hours you leave them in the  one room 
p1493
aVyou must see in how many ways they twist themselves out 
p1494
aVwhen you're alone  if you're miserable 
p1495
aVyou're obviously in bad company  isn't it
p1496
aV
p1497
aVso  all the young people should do this to yourself 
p1498
aVat least for three days 
p1499
aVone week 
p1500
aVi will provide you the atmosphere 
p1501
aVotherwise  you can walk into the himalayas  
p1502
aVbut there  there is no food and supply  you know 
p1503
aVyou will have to go searching 
p1504
aVi will provide you food  everything 
p1505
aVjust come  spend some time  not with any purpose 
p1506
aVsimply 
p1507
aVif you sit along for three days  
p1508
aVno television  no book  no texting 
p1509
aVsimply by yourself 
p1510
aVlet's see what happens 
p1511
aVyou must know the nature of who you are 
p1512
aVyou should not go on dodging yourself
p1513
aVand one day you will explode into something 
p1514
aVyou must know what is the level of madness you're suffering 
p1515
aVwhen i say madness  
p1516
aVif your mind is out of your control 
p1517
aVis that called madness
p1518
aVin definition 
p1519
ag1427
ag350
aV if your mind does not take instructions from you 
p1520
aVit's out of control 
p1521
aVis that called madness 
p1522
ag350
aV just try 
p1523
aVjust today  after this event 
p1524
aVjust go sit quietly in your room  
p1525
aVjust see
p1526
aVwhat all your mind does 
p1527
aVyou  you decide 
p1528
aVdon't tell anybody  
p1529
aVyou decide what is the level of madness you're going through 
p1530
aVwith this  if you enter the world  what will you create 
p1531
aVyou will only create who you are  isn't it 
p1532
aVyou cannot do anything other than what you are 
p1533
aVwhat you are is what will happen to the world around you 
p1534
aVbefore you step out into the world 
p1535
aVis it not important  at least
p1536
aVyou're this much equipped   that you are not the problem 
p1537
aVif you meet a problem and get married  we'll see
p1538
ag260
aVbut you are not the problem  
p1539
aVcan you make this happen for yourself 
p1540
aVas young people  
p1541
ag1441
ag608
aVyou are not the issue in your life 
p1542
aVother issues  if they come  we will deal with it
p1543
aVto the best of our ability 
p1544
aVbut this  should not be a issue  isn't it 
p1545
aVthis can be easily done   very simple processes 
p1546
aVif you invest one twenty   thirty minutes a day 
p1547
aVyou can bring this possibility into your life 
p1548
aVit is just that it needs a certain orientation
p1549
aVbecause life is continuously outward 
p1550
aVto turn inward it needs a certain help
p1551
aVand situation has to be created to make that happen 
p1552
aVwe are very much willing to do that with you 
p1553
aVit's my wish and my blessing this must happen
p1554
aVto every youth of this country
p1555
aVbecause india 
p1556
aVthe people of india has suffered immensely 
p1557
aVi don't know to what extent all of you were exposed 
p1558
aVmany of you are from good families 
p1559
aVi have walked through rural societies
p1560
aVright from my  you know  early youth 
p1561
aVit's not good 
p1562
ag1301
aVit's just not good 
p1563
aVit's not some idyllic situation out there 
p1564
aVit is bad 
p1565
aVit's very bad 
p1566
aVin most parts of the world 
p1567
aVwhere we are they say they are the better off states 
p1568
aVthe better off states are like that 
p1569
aVi know the bimarus  how they are 
p1570
aVwe can't just live like this 
p1571
aVwe can't just continue to live like this  
p1572
aVinsulating our humanity and thinking everything is okay 
p1573
aVit's time we
p1574
aVwe have a living humanity 
p1575
aVthat our heart beats for everything 
p1576
aVour heart bleeds for everything 
p1577
aVand we will do the best we can do 
p1578
aVin our lives  if we do not do what we cannot do  there's no problem 
p1579
aVbut if we do not do what we can do 
p1580
aVwe are a disastrous life  isn't it 
p1581
aVit's my wish and my blessing
p1582
aVyou should not be that disaster  
p1583
aV all right  so we'll now begin with the audience q and a 
p1584
aVanyone who has a question can raise his hand
p1585
aVand we have students here who'll get the mike to you 
p1586
aV namaskaram sadhguru 
p1587
aV where are you 
p1588
aV okay 
p1589
aV sadhguru
p1590
aV little closer  if you can  
p1591
aV so what    dissolve    to you
p1592
aV all 
p1593
ag1247
aV all suffering to me  
p1594
aV dissolve into you 
p1595
aV ooh 
p1596
aV i have read it in your book  so how can    dissolve ourselves into you 
p1597
aV i am not sulfuric acid  
p1598
aVlet's understand this  
p1599
aVwhat is dissolution 
p1600
aVi don't know how you got this 
p1601
aVthat is not what has been said anywhere 
p1602
aVbut  little off  but let me correct that 
p1603
aVsee  whether people are conscious of it
p1604
aVor not conscious of it 
p1605
aVevery human being  knowingly or unknowingly 
p1606
aVare seeking solutions to wherever they are  isn't it so 
p1607
aVor in other words 
p1608
aVthe nature of human intelligence is such
p1609
aVthat wherever you are 
p1610
aVthere is a problem  
p1611
ag388
aVthis happened
p1612
aVyou  it's okay if i tell you a joke  hmm 
p1613
aVi know it's a serious question 
p1614
aVvery spiritual  
p1615
aVa husband and wife who were over seventy years of age 
p1616
aVwere celebrating their forty fifth wedding anniversary 
p1617
aVtch 
p1618
aVso they decided
p1619
aVthey will go through everything
p1620
aVjust the way it happened on the wedding day 
p1621
aVso  wedding got over 
p1622
aVthey went to the church where they got married 
p1623
aVthey came out of it at the same time 
p1624
aVthen  as they did on that day 
p1625
aVthey went to a romantic italian movie 
p1626
aVthen after that 
p1627
aVthey went for a dinner in a particular restaurant 
p1628
aVthey had the same kind of food and the same kind of wine
p1629
aVand they started driving 
p1630
aVthen the wife said 
p1631
aV john  what's happened with you 
p1632
aVdo you remember forty five years ago
p1633
aVwhen we were driving 
p1634
aVhow passionately you kissed me 
p1635
aVso he said   okay   
p1636
aVhey  don t laugh 
p1637
aVyou don't know what is forty five years later  
p1638
aVthat's a different world  okay  
p1639
aVso  he tried to kiss her
p1640
aVand unfortunately forty five years later
p1641
aVyour body is not the same
p1642
aVand the cars are faster 
p1643
aVand boom they went into the bridge 
p1644
aVso  they were at the gates of heaven  
p1645
aVthen they got checked in together  
p1646
aVand because both of them were golfers 
p1647
aVthey asked 
p1648
aV is there a golf course in heaven 
p1649
aVsaint peter said 
p1650
aV yes  the best  the best golf course you would have ever seen 
p1651
aV so  can we see 
p1652
aVhe said  fine 
p1653
aVthey saw it was an immaculate course 
p1654
ag1648
aV can we tee off 
p1655
aVis there a tee time 
p1656
aVanytime is tee time in heaven 
p1657
aVday or night 
p1658
ag69
aV but we don't have our clubs 
p1659
aV no problem  just for you  fitted for you 
p1660
aVgolden clubs 
p1661
aVso  the man teed off  splitting the fairway 
p1662
aVstraight and long 
p1663
ag1618
aVthe lady walked up to the lady  lady's tee and teed off 
p1664
aVagain  straight 
p1665
aVthen they were walking towards the ball for the second shot 
p1666
aVsuddenly the husband became depressed 
p1667
aVas it usually  many times happens to the husbands  
p1668
aVshe looked at him and said 
p1669
aV john  what's the problem 
p1670
aVwe are in heaven 
p1671
aVwe are on the best golf course 
p1672
aVyou had a great shot 
p1673
aVi had a great shot 
p1674
aVwhy are you so depressed 
p1675
aVhe said 
p1676
aV if it was not for your stupid health food 
p1677
aVwe could have come here long time ago   
p1678
aVso  this is the nature of human intellect  
p1679
aVbecause it gets only one face of everything 
p1680
aVit is always thinking some
p1681
aVeverything is a problem 
p1682
aVwhen you don't have a problem 
p1683
aVyou're dissolved 
p1684
aVplease see this 
p1685
aVbecause you are not a problem  you're a possibility  
p1686
aVwhen people
p1687
aVmost people
p1688
aVmost people  when they utter the word human 
p1689
aVthey say   oh  i am only a human 
p1690
aVthey're always referring to the word human
p1691
aVas a limitation 
p1692
aVas a problem 
p1693
aVvery few people are saying   i am human 
p1694
aVreferring to the immensity of being human
p1695
aVbecause most people have not explored
p1696
aVthe immensity of what it means to be human 
p1697
aVthis is why there is so much talk about
p1698
aVheaven and god and so many things  
p1699
aVbecause people have failed to explore
p1700
ag1697
aVif you explore the full depth and dimension
p1701
aVof what it means to be human 
p1702
aVthen you don't worry about dissolution
p1703
aVbecause is it true
p1704
aVis it true that you were not born this way 
p1705
aVof this size  as you are today 
p1706
ag1427
ag350
aV slowly you accumulated 
p1707
ag921
aVjust the food that you've eaten  isn't it 
p1708
aVwhat you accumulate can be yours 
p1709
aVyou cannot say it's me  isn't it 
p1710
ag1427
aVas i'm speaking 
p1711
aVi pick up this vessel and say 
p1712
aV this is my vessel 
p1713
aVthen you will think 
p1714
aV oh  sadhguru has some problem  
p1715
aVbut everybody says he's wise  let us listen some more 
p1716
aVafter some time i say 
p1717
aV this is me  then you will say 
p1718
aV let's go  
p1719
aVbecause now it's dangerous  isn't it  
p1720
aVbut this you're doing every day  
p1721
aVfood appears on your plate 
p1722
aVyou say   this is my food 
p1723
aVyou eat it and then you say   this is me 
p1724
aVyou
p1725
aVif you get this point today 
p1726
aVthat the body that you carry is just a piece of the planet
p1727
aV  today if you get it experientially 
p1728
aVyour life will chance today 
p1729
aVotherwise  one day you will anyway get it from the maggots 
p1730
aVbut it's a bit late  you know 
p1731
aVso dissolution does not mean destruction 
p1732
aVdissolution means you broke the boundaries of your individuality
p1733
aVbecause your individual existence is a myth that you have created 
p1734
aVyou are very much individual 
p1735
aVyou don't like the person who is sitting next to you right now 
p1736
aVso don't breathe the air that they are breathing 
p1737
aVdo one thing 
p1738
aVjust close your nose like this  
p1739
aVhold it like this  for two minutes 
p1740
aVyou know that without communication you won't last for a moment 
p1741
aVthis is not just with respiration 
p1742
aVthis is with every particle in this body 
p1743
aVwithout being in communication with the entire existence 
p1744
aVthis  cannot exist for a moment 
p1745
aVso dissolution is not something that you have to do 
p1746
aVif you drop the conclusions that you have made about yourself 
p1747
aVthis is already dissolved 
p1748
aVmodern physics is telling you this  isn't it 
p1749
aVyou already dissolved 
p1750
aVyou don't have to dissolve 
p1751
aVit is just that you have a fancy idea in your head 
p1752
aVto get that idea out is the spiritual process 
p1753
aVspiritual process is not a real process 
p1754
aVspiritual process is just helping you
p1755
aVto distance yourself
p1756
aVfrom your physiological and psychological process
p1757
aVso that you see life just the way it is  
p1758
aV sadhguru 
p1759
ag1588
aV here  
p1760
ag1589
aV so  i completely resonate with the idea of yours
p1761
aVwhich you have in education
p1762
aVand having graduated from this place 
p1763
aVand i don't know why i did engineering 
p1764
aVone year of preparation 
p1765
aVfour years of b  tech 
p1766
aVtwo years of m  tech 
p1767
aVout of that frustration of why i'm doing engineering 
p1768
aVi wanted to work in the education sector 
p1769
aVand currently i am working 
p1770
aVi feel
p1771
aVi face many challenges 
p1772
aVto bring about a change in the system of how things are working
p1773
aVand how children are taught 
p1774
aVit takes very
p1775
aVit is a very slow process of how things move
p1776
aVand how much you try that 
p1777
aVokay  there should be a holistic development and this and that 
p1778
aVthings boil down to  okay 
p1779
aVfall at feet and do this and do that
p1780
aVthough  i want to ask you  if you
p1781
aVif you can give some tips on how your
p1782
aVhow you think of how education should be  
p1783
aVcan be actually scaled up 
p1784
aVthere are so many models
p1785
aVwhich are there in some parts of the country
p1786
aVwhich believe in this 
p1787
aVand i too feel  kee  
p1788
aVmediation can be introduced in the system of education 
p1789
aVso  what do you feel kee  
p1790
aVhow can we make this happen at a large level 
p1791
aV please  
p1792
aVsee  we are always thinking of changing the system 
p1793
aVi am not saying it should not  it should 
p1794
aVbut within the existing systems we can do many things 
p1795
aVdepending upon the individual teachers and individual educators 
p1796
aVhow they operate 
p1797
aVbecause when you try to change the system in your own time 
p1798
aVwhen you want to change the system 
p1799
aVyou must understand
p1800
aVany system 
p1801
aVeven within the family if you want to change a system 
p1802
aVit will take many years 
p1803
aVit's not going to change overnight 
p1804
aVsometimes a generation has to pass as
p1805
aVfor it to change 
p1806
aVto walk into a house with your shoes on 
p1807
aVone generation has to pass   isn't it 
p1808
aVso 
p1809
aVinstead of thinking how to change the system  
p1810
ag388
aVwe must have the vision of changing the system 
p1811
aVbut within the system 
p1812
aVhow to do the maximum delivery
p1813
aVis something that all of us should always look at 
p1814
aVotherwise  we are always talking about future generations
p1815
aVwithout addressing the current generations 
p1816
aVit'll never work that way 
p1817
aVit'll only be a dream 
p1818
aVwe have to make the difference in the current generation 
p1819
aVonly then  if you take a small step now 
p1820
aVthe next generation will take a bigger step 
p1821
aVbut without taking this step 
p1822
aVwe are dreaming of a big step 
p1823
aVit will not happen 
p1824
aVit will be just an idea which will not work 
p1825
aVso  as an educator  
p1826
aVyou mentioned the word meditation 
p1827
aVwe must understand this  what meditation means 
p1828
aVthe word meditation 
p1829
aVthe english word meditation doesn't mean anything 
p1830
aVif somebody sits with their eyes closed 
p1831
aVpeople think they are meditating 
p1832
aVbut you can sit with your eyes closed for many reasons 
p1833
aVunable to bear the world 
p1834
aVyou can close your eyes  
p1835
ag388
aVyou may be
p1836
aVin yoga there is many things  
p1837
aVyou may be doing
p1838
aVjapa  tapa  dharana  dhyana  samadhi  shoonya  samyama  
p1839
aVwe don't know what you're doing 
p1840
aVso there is
p1841
aVthe word meditation is not specific 
p1842
aVit is too general
p1843
aVand it's not saying anything in particular 
p1844
aVlet us say if we are thinking to align the word meditation
p1845
aVwith what we refer to as dhyan 
p1846
aVor dhyana 
p1847
aVor dhayanam as you go south 
p1848
aVbecause hindi speaking people 
p1849
aVyou have a way of clipping away the words in the end 
p1850
ag608
aVwe say rama  you say ram 
p1851
aVwe say dhyanam you said dhyan  tch 
p1852
aVyou're cutting off everything in the end 
p1853
aVthat's your option 
p1854
aVbut if you're thinking it is dhyan  or dhyana  or whatever 
p1855
aVwhat this means is 
p1856
aVif you sit here
p1857
aVif you sit here 
p1858
aVif you clear
p1859
aVif you have a distinct experience
p1860
aVthat your body is here  
p1861
aVyou mind is somewhere else 
p1862
aVwhat is you is elsewhere 
p1863
aVor in other words  there is a little space
p1864
aVbetween what is you and what is your body 
p1865
aVwhat is you and what is the content of your mind 
p1866
aVsuppose this little space was achieved within you right now 
p1867
aVwould all these young boys be complaining about stress 
p1868
aVyou must do one thing  
p1869
aVif you were an aviator you would know this  
p1870
aVyou're driving to the airport 
p1871
aVtraffic jam  traffic jam  traffic jam 
p1872
aVouhh  you curse everybody
p1873
aVand honk and do all this and get there 
p1874
aVthen you fly 
p1875
aVthen you're flying over the traffic jam 
p1876
aVit all looks very nice  you know  
p1877
aVsimply because of the distance  
p1878
aVwhen you were in it 
p1879
aVit was a terrible thing 
p1880
aVonce you're flying above it  it looks quite nice actually 
p1881
aVtraffic jams  
p1882
aVonce there is a little distance 
p1883
aVthat's the end of suffering 
p1884
aVso if they
p1885
aVif you create a little space between you and your body 
p1886
aVbetween you and your mind 
p1887
aVthis is the end of suffering
p1888
aVbecause there are only two kinds of sufferings in your life  
p1889
aVphysical suffering  mental suffering 
p1890
aVdo you know any other kind of suffering 
p1891
ag608
aVonly two sufferings 
p1892
aVif you distance yourself a little bit  that's all 
p1893
aVdistancing is not by attitude 
p1894
aVanyway these are accumulations 
p1895
aVyou gathered this body 
p1896
aVyou gathered this mind 
p1897
aVif you keep what belongs to you one way 
p1898
aVand what is you in another way 
p1899
aVit's taken care of 
p1900
aVso  we can teach you a simple method
p1901
aVwith which you can do this  
p1902
aVvery  very simple process 
p1903
aVevery human being is capable of this 
p1904
ag1599
aVwhen it comes to external realities 
p1905
aVall of us are differently capable 
p1906
aVno two human beings are equally capable 
p1907
aVwhen it comes to inner possibilities 
p1908
aVall of us are equally capable 
p1909
aVno human being has come better endowed than the other 
p1910
aVit is just that
p1911
aVmost human beings never look in that direction  
p1912
aV namaste sadhguru  mein  i m here 
p1913
aVmy name is kamal 
p1914
aVi m here with my wife  my mother
p1915
aVand thank you so much for coming here 
p1916
aVwe have been following your guidance for many years now
p1917
aVand it inspired us to 
p1918
aVyou mentioned about iyc 
p1919
aVit inspired us to create yic or young india challenge
p1920
aVwhere two days back we invited the youth of india from erode 
p1921
aVbangalore  assam to solve india s challenges
p1922
aVand i would like to ask you is that
p1923
aVthe way we re connecting this is that
p1924
aVif people find their passion and do what they love 
p1925
aVthey should be able to positively contribute to the society
p1926
aVand solve the biggest challenge 
p1927
aVbut we see that there are so many practical situations
p1928
aVthat young people face
p1929
aVand today we re talking about youth and truth 
p1930
aVhow can we do this more
p1931
aVand wake up more and more young people
p1932
aVthat not only they follow their passion
p1933
aVbut they must connect it to nation building
p1934
aVand solving the biggest challenges of our time 
p1935
aVespecially the youth here which is as you said  privileged
p1936
aVand has house  shelter and the basics are covered 
p1937
aVhow can we make it more experiential 
p1938
aVthat it becomes a movement
p1939
aVthat young people not only do what they love
p1940
aVbut also make a positive impact 
p1941
aVhow can we do this more and get a large number of young people
p1942
aVto get into this conversation 
p1943
aV you are the young man 
p1944
aVi m willing to speak to any young people or old people 
p1945
aVi 
p1946
aVi don't see youth as a numerical entity 
p1947
aVi think lot of young people are pretty old  
p1948
aVcomplaining about stress  
p1949
aVbeing young or old is not just of age 
p1950
aVnot the question of your birthday 
p1951
aVwhen you were born 
p1952
aVhave you 
p1953
aVare you an exuberant life
p1954
aVor have you become  
p1955
aVyouth means life in the making 
p1956
aVall possibilities wide open 
p1957
aVthat s what youth means 
p1958
aVyou ve not become conceited yet 
p1959
aVyou should not be  i m saying  
p1960
aVyou ve not made your conclusions about life 
p1961
aVyou re still willing to look at everything fresh 
p1962
ag1958
aVi think it s the business of every human being to stay that way all their life
p1963
aVthat you never make your conclusions 
p1964
aVyou become a constant exploration
p1965
aVand a seeking in life 
p1966
aVthat you ve not become a conclusion 
p1967
aVconclusion should happen with death 
p1968
aVbefore that if you conclude 
p1969
aVthen we will have to endure dead people walking around in the society
p1970
aVwho have no zest for anything but we have to bear with them  
p1971
aVthat should not happen to you or to anybody  isn t it 
p1972
aVso  you said many things in one question 
p1973
aVabout nation building 
p1974
aVabout many things 
p1975
ag388
aVin seventy years we should have built the nation
p1976
aVbut we have made some grave mistakes
p1977
aVfor which we are paying the price
p1978
aVbut there s no point doing postmortem
p1979
aVand going on thinking what we could have done right at that time 
p1980
aVwe should do the right things now
p1981
aVand as a 
p1982
aVas a nation 
p1983
aVas a culture 
p1984
aVi must tell you this 
p1985
aVi speak to variety of people 
p1986
aVto the highest level of academics 
p1987
aVscientists 
p1988
aVvarious parts of the world 
p1989
aVbut i still find 
p1990
aVif you take a bunch of people 
p1991
aVjust like that if you catch them 
p1992
aVone hundred people on the street in mumbai or bangalore or chennai 
p1993
aVthey re much smarter than anybody you can find anywhere 
p1994
aVreally 
p1995
aVno  i 
p1996
aVi didn t mean to leave out delhi  
p1997
aVi m saying average intelligence in this country 
p1998
aVaverage intellect in this country is naturally high
p1999
aVbecause of a certain cultural ethos
p2000
aVthat we ve had for a long time 
p2001
aVbut our problem is 
p2002
aVthere human intelligence is organized to produce something 
p2003
aVhere human intelligence is disorganized 
p2004
aVeverybody is a genius but nothing happens 
p2005
aVyou go and sit in a tea shop 
p2006
aVhe will be telling you how virat kohli 
p2007
aVyou know his bat is 
p2008
aVhe s not holding it right 
p2009
aVtch what he should do 
p2010
aVthe tea shop owner 
p2011
aVhe will also say how narendra modi does not know this  this  this
p2012
aVhow he should have done this 
p2013
aVhow he should have done that 
p2014
aVonly problem is  he does not know how to make good tea
p2015
ag260
aVwe must transit from this 
p2016
aVwe must be a conscious application of genius 
p2017
aVnot a wild application of genius 
p2018
aVit will not produce any results 
p2019
aVit will only create problems 
p2020
aVit s very important that we organize india
p2021
aVto a productive future
p2022
aVotherwise we ll work against each other constantly 
p2023
aVsee  we re driving against each other 
p2024
aVall of us could easily drive 
p2025
aVwith the roads that we have 
p2026
aVfor the traffic that we have  we could easily drive well 
p2027
aVwe could easily come  come up with something  
p2028
aVokay  everybody must drive minimum sixty kilometers per hours 
p2029
aVbecause there are some very fast drivers 
p2030
aVsome slow drivers 
p2031
aVsome who don t know what is driving 
p2032
aVsome who thinks they are formula 1 racers 
p2033
aVall kinds of people are there on the same street 
p2034
aVyou know  this i realized about twenty years ago or more here 
p2035
aVabout twenty years ago  when i first went to united states 
p2036
aVi m always used to putting my right foot down 
p2037
aVfull on 
p2038
aVso i m hitting like hundred and fifty miles per hour 
p2039
aVpeople say 
p2040
aV sadhguru don t do this  they will handcuff you 
p2041
aVi said 
p2042
aV why  the road is wide open 
p2043
aVthe engine is good  what s my problem 
p2044
aVand i m okay 
p2045
aVthey said 
p2046
aV no  sadhguru  that s not the thing 
p2047
aVsee here they put seventy 
p2048
aVyou have to go seventy only 
p2049
aVit took me some time to understand 
p2050
aVthen i looked around  then i see a eighty two year old woman is driving a school bus 
p2051
aVthen i saw 
p2052
aV okay  i can drive at any speed and keep the car on the road 
p2053
aVbut now this lady who s eighty two is driving a school bus 
p2054
aVmaybe if i go bhooom like this next to her 
p2055
aVwe don t what happens to her 
p2056
aVthen it took me a year to take this passion of putting my right foot down 
p2057
aVnow i m little controlled
p2058
aVand just above the speed limit i am  
p2059
aVbecause i started appreciating the organization 
p2060
aVit kind of 
p2061
aVfor an indian mind it s a little difficult
p2062
aVbecause what i can do 
p2063
aVi can do
p2064
aVbut what about the rest of the organization 
p2065
aVthe organization has been done so that everybody can participate in it 
p2066
aVi may be good at something so i will do it in a certain way 
p2067
aVif i want to do that  i must go on a racetrack  you know 
p2068
aVi really want to hit two hundred miles per hour 
p2069
aVi must go on a racetrack  not on the road 
p2070
aVbecause the road is made for everybody 
p2071
aVall kinds of people are driving
p2072
aVand most people don t have help
p2073
aVeven though they re eighty five  ninety 
p2074
aVthere are ninety year olds driving 
p2075
aVyou can't drive at hundred miles per hour next to him 
p2076
aVbut we can easily set this up 
p2077
aVi m just taking road as an example 
p2078
aVwith every aspect of our life 
p2079
aVi think india what it lacks is
p2080
aVtoo much genius and not enough organization 
p2081
aVyou young people must bring that organization into this country
p2082
aVso that this intellectual investment
p2083
aVor intellectual you know  the bank that we have 
p2084
aVthe human resource that we have can become a great potential 
p2085
aVnot a huge problem 
p2086
aVit can become a big problem if it is not organized  
p2087
aV so we re running a little short of time 
p2088
aVit s gonna be the last question we ll be taking 
p2089
aVplease  microphone  take the microphone 
p2090
aV no  i don t need one    
p2091
aVthere is so much effort and struggle to change
p2092
aVand design human mind when we are on the    
p2093
aVis there any way to design that    
p2094
aV you must use the microphone  
p2095
aVmicrophone is not your requirement 
p2096
aVit s my requirement  
p2097
aV thank you  madam 
p2098
aVi said there is so much effort and struggle
p2099
aVto design and shape human mind
p2100
aVwhen we are out of womb 
p2101
aVis there any way you know sir
p2102
aVto design human mind when we are inside womb 
p2103
aVthat s my question 
p2104
aV at home  is that what you are asking 
p2105
aV inside womb 
p2106
aV oh  whoa  whoa  whoa  
p2107
aVwho is pregnant  
p2108
aVnow if you do not know this 
p2109
aVmaybe in northern part of the country
p2110
aVit s largely almost gone totally 
p2111
aVin south it s still little alive in the villages
p2112
aVbut they re also it s wiped out quite a bit 
p2113
aVif you do not know this
p2114
aVfrom preconception to conception
p2115
aVto various stages of pregnancy and delivery
p2116
aVand as long as the mother is feeding the child
p2117
aVthere s an entire established process in this country
p2118
aVas to how a woman should eat 
p2119
aVwhat she should do 
p2120
aVwhose kind
p2121
aVwhat kind of people she should interact with 
p2122
aVwhat kind of form she should look at 
p2123
aVwhat kind of form she should not look at 
p2124
aVwhat kind of sounds she should hear 
p2125
aVwhat kind of sound she should not hear 
p2126
aVall this was very much there 
p2127
aVbut we must also understand life has changed 
p2128
aVtoday women are going to work 
p2129
aVthey have to get into that horrible bus
p2130
aVwhere they re pushed around
p2131
aVit doesn t matter she is pregnant
p2132
aVand all kinds of things  
p2133
aVall kinds of fumes 
p2134
aVall kinds of sounds 
p2135
aVall kinds of noises 
p2136
aVall kinds of abuse 
p2137
aVevery kind of thing happening to her 
p2138
aVin some way we are doing that to the child also 
p2139
aVthere is no job in the country
p2140
aVor in the world where
p2141
aVyou can take off for one and a half years and get back to the job
p2142
aVto fulfill this 
p2143
aVin one way because of various things  
p2144
aVthis is 
p2145
aVi m not passing a judgment on this
p2146
aVbut for various reasons
p2147
aVwe are not taking
p2148
aVthe business of manufacturing the next generation of people
p2149
aVwith sufficient care 
p2150
aVtch  we are not paying enough attention to it
p2151
aVfor which we ll pay a price 
p2152
aVover a period of time we will pay an immense price for that 
p2153
aVbut we are definitely not taking enough care about it
p2154
aVin the entire world not just in this country
p2155
aVbecause we ve got all kinds of social situations
p2156
aVwhich does not allow that space for a woman to dedicate that kind of time and attention 
p2157
aVsee  being pregnant is not just about reproduction 
p2158
aVwe literally manufacturing the next generation of people  isn t it 
p2159
aVis it not important of all the products that you produce on this planet 
p2160
aVis it not most important that we produce wonderful human beings
p2161
aVfor the future generation 
p2162
aVis it not the most important thing  
p2163
aVbut we have created a social situation and an economic situation
p2164
aVwhere there is no such possibility
p2165
aVto take care of these things 
p2166
aVto whatever extent
p2167
aVindividual woman
p2168
aVor individual families can take care of it
p2169
aVthey can take care of it
p2170
aVbut for the larger society it s out of question
p2171
aVbecause things have changed 
p2172
aVyou can t turn it back just like that 
p2173
aV sir  one question
p2174
aV hey  still the child is not born yet  
p2175
aVthe
p2176
aVthe intelligence of the body is such
p2177
aVif you already do not know this 
p2178
aVif a woman delivers a male child 
p2179
aVthe quality of the milk that she produces is in a certain way 
p2180
aVif she delivers a female child
p2181
aVthe quality of the milk is totally different 
p2182
aVif she delivers twin  if she delivers twins 
p2183
aVone male and one female 
p2184
aVone breast will ooze certain type of milk 
p2185
aVanother breast will ooze another kind of milk 
p2186
aVthis is the level of intelligence invested in this body 
p2187
aVwe have to treat it with that much care 
p2188
aVthis is not some crude machinery 
p2189
aVthis is the finest piece of technology on the planet  isn t it 
p2190
ag232
aVthis is the finest thing 
p2191
aVin the entire evolutionary scale 
p2192
aVthese millions of years of work that nature did
p2193
aVto produce this
p2194
aVbut in our desperation for economic well being
p2195
aVi think we are not paying the kind of attention that this needs 
p2196
aVthe kind of care that this needs
p2197
aVso that this can function at the highest level
p2198
aVand can also produce human beings for the future who are of a certain kind 
p2199
aVso how to develop the brain when they re in the womb 
p2200
aVit s very important that
p2201
aVthe atmosphere in which the child is growing up in a certain way
p2202
aVwith the least amount of disturbance 
p2203
aVwith right kind of reverberations 
p2204
aVright kind of sounds 
p2205
aVright kind of food  everything 
p2206
aVtoday they re barely nourished the pregnant woman
p2207
aVin most part of the country  they re barely nourished 
p2208
aVwhere is the question of right kind of vibrations 
p2209
aVright kind of atmospheres 
p2210
aVone thing we can do for this is 
p2211
aVevery home 
p2212
aVif possible every working place 
p2213
aVwe can have a consecrated space 
p2214
aVtoday slowly they are coming up with instruments
p2215
aVwhich can measure the reverberations of certain objects 
p2216
aVwe can create consecrated spaces
p2217
aVor we can create consecrated objects
p2218
aVwhich at least at that time she can carry upon her body so that 
p2219
aVkind of to some extent  
p2220
aVit s not the best solution  
p2221
aVto some extent it neutralizes the outside impact
p2222
aVto whatever extent possible 
p2223
aVor if she lives in a home
p2224
aVthe place where she sleeps and other things are taken care of 
p2225
aVsome amount of respite can be there for there
p2226
aVfor that new life which is blossoming within the womb 
p2227
aVplease  
p2228
aV sir  by reading ancient scriptures
p2229
aVlike bhagwat gita or guru grand saheb
p2230
aVwe tend to become very much pure 
p2231
aVwe look the world from a different perspective 
p2232
aV what  what is that 
p2233
aVyou become pure 
p2234
aV a person becomes pure 
p2235
aV but why were they impure  
p2236
ag408
aVwhy were they impure 
p2237
aV because sometimes people are very much unkind 
p2238
aV un 
p2239
aV unkind 
p2240
aV unkind  oh 
p2241
aV so we look at the world in a different way 
p2242
aVwe become very much kind
p2243
aVand we develop the tendency of forgiving people
p2244
aVbut what happens when we go to the work place
p2245
aVwe realize that
p2246
aVbecause of your this attitude 
p2247
aVbecause you become very much kind
p2248
aVand you have the tendency to forgive people
p2249
aVthe other people they start using you 
p2250
aVso what should we do 
p2251
aVwhat a person should do in such cases 
p2252
aVshould a person stop reading such ancient scriptures like bhagwat gita  guru grant saheb
p2253
aVor what is the right age to read such books  
p2254
aV now  one thing  the last part of the question that you said 
p2255
aVother people will start using you 
p2256
aVthat means you re not using yourself well 
p2257
aVthat there is space and time that others can use you 
p2258
aVif you re using yourself to the fullest extent
p2259
aVnobody will have an opportunity to use you  
p2260
aVsee 
p2261
aVif your
p2262
aVlet us say you re using something
p2263
aVtwenty four hours of the day 
p2264
aVwhere will i get the time to use the same thing 
p2265
aVso twenty four hours of the day
p2266
aVevery moment of your life
p2267
aVif you are using this  to the fullest extent
p2268
aVto do whatever you want to do
p2269
aVwhere is the chance for somebody to use this 
p2270
aVif you re not using this 
p2271
aVit s good somebody else is using it  
p2272
aVnow
p2273
aVanyway bhagwat gita is not about kindness 
p2274
aVkrishna is talking about war  
p2275
aVhe s a very practical person 
p2276
aVwhere there is war needed 
p2277
aVhe is trying to instigate war 
p2278
aVhe sees there is no other solution
p2279
aVso he is saying let s go to war 
p2280
aVsomebody else is hesitating 
p2281
aVhe says  this is it 
p2282
aVthis is the time to fight 
p2283
aVthis is not the time to hesitate 
p2284
aVwhere is kindness in this 
p2285
aVvery simple political sense 
p2286
aVwhat needs to be done is being done 
p2287
aVhe is only saying don t get caught up in this activity 
p2288
aVyou need to do it  just do it 
p2289
aVdon t make too much fuss about it 
p2290
aVkindness  tch
p2291
ag2261
aVkindness means
p2292
aVkindness is useful only for the fallen  isn t it 
p2293
aVwhen you re standing on your feet
p2294
aVdo you want somebody to be kind to you 
p2295
ag1427
aVlet us say you were going to your friend s house every day 
p2296
aVthey welcomed you and everything 
p2297
aVthey fed you
p2298
aVand took care of you
p2299
aVbut one day you realized
p2300
aVthey were doing it simply because they were kind to you 
p2301
aVtch  will you feel insulted or no 
p2302
ag232
ag232
ag350
aV only when you re fallen kindness matters 
p2303
ag2294
aVyou don t want kindness 
p2304
aVyou want acceptance 
p2305
aVyou want respect  you want
p2306
ag232
aVso kindness is only for the sick and the dying
p2307
aVnot for young 
p2308
aVyou should not ask for kindness ever 
p2309
aVdo you want to pass because your professor is kind to you
p2310
ag1497
aVdo you
p2311
aVdo you want to get a job because somebody is kind to you
p2312
aVor because out of your competence you want to get the job 
p2313
aVwhich way is it 
p2314
aVdo not seek anything in this life out of kindness 
p2315
aVthat will happen when you re in your death bed 
p2316
aVwhen you can t do anything for yourself 
p2317
aVthen you expect some kindness 
p2318
aVthat also
p2319
aVif you re very capable
p2320
aVyou can handle that also 
p2321
aVyou can walk to your grave and die 
p2322
aVi can teach you that technology also  
p2323
ag388
aVthat as you live consciously
p2324
aVyou can also die consciously 
p2325
aVit is possible for a human being to do this 
p2326
aVa whole lot of creatures do this  do you know 
p2327
aVdo you know
p2328
aVwhen a cobra wants to die
p2329
aVit  it finds a place somewhere
p2330
aVusually on top of a tree 
p2331
aVone branch where nobody can reach
p2332
aVand just sits there for over twelve for fifteen days
p2333
aVwithout eating and it ll die there 
p2334
aVwhen i first noticed this i didn t figure this 
p2335
aVi thought why is this cobra become so skinny 
p2336
aVi brought it home
p2337
aVand i pour milk into his mouth
p2338
aVand i tried to make him eat
p2339
aVand then i leave him 
p2340
aVhe again goes up the tree and sits there 
p2341
aVthree  four times i bring him down 
p2342
aVagain he goes up there and sits there
p2343
aVand after five days he s dead 
p2344
aVso when a crawly creature like a snake
p2345
aVhas this much awareness
p2346
aVthat life is coming to an end and he wants to die in a certain way 
p2347
aVhuman beings must have this  isn t it 
p2348
aVin this culture we developed this 
p2349
aVwhen a human being knows his life is ebbing 
p2350
aVhe withdraws 
p2351
aVhe sits by himself 
p2352
aVit s called vanaprastha 
p2353
aVhe goes into the jungle  sits by himself 
p2354
aVslowly leaves his life
p2355
aVthis body 
p2356
aVthis is a wonderful way of conducting life 
p2357
aVnow till the last moment somebody is pumping it
p2358
aVbecause it s an industry  
p2359
aVit doesn t matter they want to stretch you for another few hours
p2360
aVbecause few hours will cost a few thousand rupees
p2361
aVand whatever else  that s different 
p2362
aVso  don t
p2363
aVas a young person don t ever look for kindness 
p2364
aVlet your competence open the doors
p2365
aVnot somebody s kindness  isn t it  
p2366
aVanybody 
p2367
aVplease  take the microphone
p2368
aVtake the microphone 
p2369
aVwhere are you 
p2370
aVyou don t have the microphone

aS'so i it have personal less be '

aS'that have of piichtolisvig'
p2583
aS'so but there is also a fonlickwiththoughthitthesocital life that i live in '
p2584
aS'there are responsibilities on me from the from my family'
p2585
aS'there are some social boundations that i have my '
p2586
aS'trying to be limitless'
p2587
aS'so hawdwiwovewiththisconfict or '
p2588
aS'or in fact i d like to ask that'
p2589
aS'is it even possible that we draw berybetodrawsymtesesbeween the do '
p2590
aS'you are talking like a much married man and i '
p2591
aS'this is usalyeeplomaticwayofsayngimattid'
p2592
aS'a way to understand this '
p2593
aS'everybody is thinking they are saving their own lives and whatever '
p2594
aS'the human longing to expand is not your doing'
p2595
aS'this is the nature of life itself'
p2596
aS"it's not something that i asked by for this but "
p2597
aS'i did not a thing '
p2598
aS'every human being is longing for expansion'
p2599
aS'will a long for it consciously or unconsciously'
p2600
aS'the tollatoicious'
p2601
aS'i may every human being is longing for expansion'
p2602
aS'even the beggar on the street is looking for little expansion of his devlidiryisele'
p2603
aS'is it '
p2604
aS'so one thing to expand is not your doing or my doing'
p2605
aS'this is the nature of life it in '
p2606
aS'in us '
p2607
aS'what we are doing in the world to the'
p2608
aS'is just a question of the times in which we exist'
p2609
aS'i gave me him little choices'
p2610
aS'but then he wanted to art music or indeneringoma'
p2611
aS'of something like this but essentially all this activity'
p2612
aS'is a supposed to be for human by benisintinne'
p2613
aS'so fundamentally it there only one business of human love '
p2614
aS'question is'
p2615
aS'what is your competence'
p2616
aS'what is the nature of your a you know'
p2617
aS'intelligence so that how you would be most useful so you would just that'
p2618
aS'this does not determine'
p2619
aS'you doing an engineering program or a medical program or an ant '
p2620
aS'should not decide the nature of who you are'
p2621
aS'that only decides the nature of your activity'
p2622
aS'not the need a well you are'
p2623
aS'so continuing with this thing '
p2624
aS'what is the aloffogoodo in a butenejourney '

aS'so in india '

aS'so to they you know this light is falling upon me '
p3073
aS'reflecting going through your lenses in a '
p3074
aS'codimiondthevedinatouot'
p3075
aS'a story i ended'
p3076
aS'so you see me within yourself '
p3077
aS'you hear me within yourself'
p3078
aS'are have you seen the whole world'
p3079
aS'but in your '
p3080
aS'the way it is ejective in the firmament of your mind'
p3081
aS'you have not seeing the world away etes'
p3082
aS'you re seeing it the way it s projected within you '
p3083
aS'rest hope men on be seeing the world the way you see it '
p3084
aS'seeing it differently is a '
p3085
ag2415
aS'well but he is so the sisinifelently'
p3086
aS'because his visual apple is a man completely different '
p3087
aS'no that different animals here'
p3088
aS'some years ubsortingsound'
p3089
aS'some hear udresonicsound'
p3090
aS'we we dont hear botltlemn'
p3091
aS'yes we give some'
p3092
aS'thing else'
p3093
aS'so we had all living in the same world'
p3094
aS'but seeing and hearing things completely differently'
p3095
aS'what is day for us '
p3096
aS'slightfules is darkness for some other creature '
p3097
aS'darkness with them is light for us '
p3098
aS'is our instruments of perception'
p3099
aS'are created for our survival process'
p3100
aS'and the instruments of sererival are crafted for this and vivenprocess'
p3101
aS'but now you are indesienceas blosomtoaplace'
p3102
aS'we are sadrivlis not good enough'
p3103
aS'you want to know the nature of life'
p3104
aS'once this longing comes'
p3105
aS'then you must understand the '
p3106
aS'mens of perception need to be in an '
p3107
aS'these instruments '
p3108
aS'senses of sea hearing smellencgistingandtuting'
p3109
aS'they are not good enough'
p3110
aS'because they are only instruments of survival'
p3111
aS'they are not instruments of drumoling'
p3112
aS'because they show you everything in come'
p3113
aS'vadisonewhenaseeverything in tombarisonh'
p3114
aS'now i pysicsweedoll'
p3115
aS'you stand like a '
p3116
aS'and you walk like a tall man'
p3117
aS'you think like a tall man'
p3118
aS'you are a doleman'
p3119
aS'you in another society what everybody tadeveon'
p3120
aS'said that lelstandlikeashoremanla'
p3121
aS'like a short man think like a short man you are '
p3122
aS'man is '
p3123
aS'i am saying what you know in comparison is only good for survival process not be no the nature of life'
p3124
aS'so right now everything that you know is only by company'
p3125
aS'if i do this i feel it s cool'
p3126
aS'no that s not the reality'
p3127
aS'the realities because of my body tempertudid in a certain way'
p3128
aS'i make a judgment that this is cool'
p3129
aS'suppose i lord my body temperature substantially'
p3130
aS'and then i put this'
p3131
aS'this would be one to me is '
p3132
ag2415
aS'so what you re perceiving is only become patison'
p3133
aS'what you know by competion is just a distortion of reality it '
p3134
aS'good enough for saidvival '
p3135
aS'is not good enough to know the nature of life now '
p3136
aS'talking about stress and inhsxitn'

aS'live your bodies not the same'
p4002
aS'and the cadaffaster'
p4003

p4022
aS'again that'
p4023
aS'and they were walking towards the ball for the second shot'
p4024
aS'so that y the husband became depressed'
p4025
aS'as it usually many times happens to the husbands'

aS'then i feel pbepelesssaing i am human'
p4050

p4051
aS'because most people have not explored'

aS'a garden so many things '

V good evening everyone 
p4713
ag4713
aV nobody is saying anything  
p4714
aV  no they are all here but they are very silent 
p4715
aVthey are all waiting for it all to begin
p4716
aVand let me tell you  i have to confess 
p4717
aVas i came on  
p4718
aVbefore this i was quite relaxed  
p4719
aVbut as i ve come on to the stage  my heart is beating really fast 
p4720
aVso   while guruji was praying 
p4721
aVi was saying to myself   i must be relaxed  this is the time 
p4722
aVwhen i am with my guru  i must be relaxed that this is it 
p4723
aVso  yes i will calmly begin by thanking you sadhguruji 
p4724
aVfor giving me this opportunity to be in conversation with you 
p4725
aVisha foundation  thank you very much 
p4726
aV i  i thought when we are talking about  of love and life 
p4727
aVheart beating is a good thing  
p4728
aV  okay  yes it s a good thing 
p4729
aVit shows i m alive and in love and about to begin this conversation 
p4730
aVand sadhguruji  i want to say 
p4731
aVi have attended your inner engineering program 
p4732
aVi have seen some dvds 
p4733
aVi have read your books 
p4734
aVand everywhere there are your brilliant views on various issues 
p4735
aVit could be from the making of a nation
p4736
aVto the making of a toy car 
p4737
aVfrom the running of a household to the running of parliament 
p4738
aVyou have brilliant views on every issue that one can ever question 
p4739
aVyet i know very little about you
p4740
aVand it
p4741
aVyou know here s a brilliant mind with an  for lack of better words 
p4742
aVi would say  out of the box  thinking  
p4743
aVso different 
p4744
aVso refreshing 
p4745
aVso enlightening 
p4746
aVi am fascinated and i want to know about your life 
p4747
aVand i d like to know that
p4748
aVi mean 
p4749
aVwere you just born brilliant 
p4750
aVdid it begin from that very moment 
p4751
aV i was a normal birth 
p4752
aVi didn t come in a box  
p4753
aVmy mother had a normal child 
p4754
aV no  you know 
p4755
aVi m from the movies and i can t help thinking  
p4756
aVwas it like it is in story books 
p4757
aVthat a venerable sage came to your home
p4758
aVand when he looked at your mother 
p4759
aVhe said  
p4760
aV there is going to be born a guru  rejoice 
p4761
aVhe will lighten his own path and that of others 
p4762
aV you also  you also going like this  
p4763
aV no  but was it like that or how was it 
p4764
aVhow was your childhood 
p4765
aV i don t think they all came to listen to my mother s labor pains  
p4766
aV no  i m really fascinated 
p4767
aVintrigued that we re all here
p4768
aVbut you know  the way you think 
p4769
aVwe wait to hear what you have to say 
p4770
aVwe ve all been little children
p4771
aVand we ve all grown up
p4772
aVbut we ve grown up and been educated in schools and
p4773
aVbut i find our way of thinking 
p4774
aVour way of being very conditioned 
p4775
aVlike almost systematized 
p4776
aVwhereas 
p4777
aVso where  where did it all begin 
p4778
aV i think you re looking for something unnatural that happened there  
p4779
aVone thing that could be considered unnatural was
p4780
aVit seems i was a very delayed birth 
p4781
aVmy mother went to the hospital three times and came back
p4782
aVand she gave up that he s not coming  
p4783
aVand when it actually happened  it happened at home 
p4784
aVmy father being a physician  that was not possible 
p4785
aVshe  she had to be in the hospital 
p4786
aVthree times she went and three times it didn t happen 
p4787
aVthey did everything possible and she gave up 
p4788
aVso it happened at home 
p4789
aVso  that s the only reasonably unnatural thing 
p4790
aVeverything else was natural   birth 
p4791
ag4753
aVand i refused to be educated  
p4792
aVso  what is
p4793
aVi mean the question that you re asking is 
p4794
aVdo people grow up and blossom
p4795
aVor are they brought up by somebody 
p4796
aVyou will see the general expression is 
p4797
aV i was brought up in this place 
p4798
aVi was brought up in that way 
p4799
aVespecially in the west  you will see 
p4800
aV i was brought up christian 
p4801
aV i was brought up jewish 
p4802
aVthese are very common words 
p4803
aVi think it s absolutely ridiculous and humiliating
p4804
aVthat a human being has to be brought up 
p4805
aVyou bring up cattle  okay 
p4806
aVyou don t bring up a human being 
p4807
aVa human being is supposed to blossom by his own nature 
p4808
aVthat is why he s on the top of the pile 
p4809
aVat least on this planet  in the evolutionary scale 
p4810
aVand most human beings don t seem to understand that
p4811
aVor they are not allowed to understand that by a whole lot of people
p4812
aVand they need to be brought up 
p4813
aVbringing up means somebody is molding you 
p4814
aVmolding means it s a predetermined shape 
p4815
aVand no flower that blossoms is the same way as another one 
p4816
aVwhich blossomed yesterday 
p4817
aVbut a mold means it s always going to be the same 
p4818
aVif you make a mold 
p4819
aVthe idea of making a mold is that we want to have the same form 
p4820
aVagain and again and again 
p4821
aVright now  generally that seems to be the work
p4822
aVunfortunately of the current education system 
p4823
aVthe so called religions that are operating in the world
p4824
aVand of course the family 
p4825
aVthey want you to be in a certain mold 
p4826
aVthey don t want you to blossom like a wild flower
p4827
aVbecause they re afraid of anything fresh happening among them 
p4828
aVthey want something that is familiar 
p4829
aVthey don t want something unfamiliar to be born among them 
p4830
aVso  if you have succumbed to that system 
p4831
aVthen yes  you ve been molded into a certain form 
p4832
aVif you allow your humanity to blossom 
p4833
aVthen you will see  you don t belong to any mold 
p4834
aVthis is the beauty of being human that there is no a particular way to be 
p4835
aVif you were a dog you would be one way 
p4836
aVif you were cattle you would be one way 
p4837
aVif you were a sheep you would be another way 
p4838
aVif you re bird   another way  a grasshopper   another way 
p4839
aVbut to be human means there is no particular way 
p4840
aVwhat is human is not defined  nor described 
p4841
aVit is  it is just that
p4842
aVfor every other creature on this planet 
p4843
aVnature drew two lines 
p4844
aVwithin that they have to play their game 
p4845
aVfor a human being  only the bottom line is drawn 
p4846
aVthere is no top line 
p4847
aVbut socially  people are trying to draw a top line for themselves 
p4848
aVbut nature has not drawn a top line for you 
p4849
aVit s a limitless possibility
p4850
aVand this is what is freaking human beings right now 
p4851
aVbecause they can t decide what they can   need to be 
p4852
aVthey re trying to be like somebody else 
p4853
aVonly bottom line is set  top line has been removed
p4854
aVthis is evolution 
p4855
aV but wait  we still didn t quite get to
p4856
aVso how was it when you were a child 
p4857
aVwere you  were you put into a school to go the systematic way
p4858
aVand did you keep up with it
p4859
aV do i  do i look that edu  educated 
p4860
aVdon t insult me like that  
p4861
aVactually you know  when i go and stand in the line
p4862
aVin the immigration lines  in particularly in america 
p4863
aVthey look at me and say   can you speak english 
p4864
aVi say  
p4865
aVbecause i have that uneducated look  it s not easy  
p4866
aVdo you know
p4867
aVdo you know what it takes to remain uneducated 
p4868
aVeducation is just twenty years of going somewhere and getting one certificate 
p4869
aVto remain uneducated  it s very difficult
p4870
aVbecause from the day you re born 
p4871
aVyour parents  every other adult  the school  the damn thing
p4872
aVeverybody is trying to educate you
p4873
aV yes 
p4874
aV  about something that s not worked in their life  
p4875
aV and then did you also  like we all went through these confused teenage years
p4876
aVof not really knowing where we re going 
p4877
aVi mean did you clearly know your path 
p4878
aV not at all 
p4879
aVi was  right from three or four years of age 
p4880
aVi was always a million questions hanging in  in my head 
p4881
aVi have a question about everything  
p4882
aVeverything to everything 
p4883
aVquestions means  very fundamental questions about existence itself 
p4884
aVmy own existence 
p4885
aVso  when i was three  four years of age 
p4886
aVsuddenly i realized i know nothing 
p4887
aVknow nothing means  
p4888
aVsomebody gives me a glass of water  i do not know what is water 
p4889
aVi know how to use it  i know if i drink it 
p4890
aVit will quench my thirst and so many other ways of using it
p4891
aVbut i do not know what is water 
p4892
aVi m saying even today  you do not know what is water 
p4893
aVit s the only thing available in all three states on the planet 
p4894
aVthree  two thirds of the planet is water 
p4895
aVtwo thirds of your body is water 
p4896
aVif we think life  we think water 
p4897
aVbut do you know what it is 
p4898
aVwith all the scientific exploration 
p4899
aVwe do not even know a single atom in its entirety 
p4900
aVtoday  our idea of science is 
p4901
aVlearning how to use everything 
p4902
aVyes 
p4903
aVwe know how to use an atom 
p4904
aVwe know how to break it 
p4905
aVwe know how to fuse it
p4906
aVbut we really do not know what it is 
p4907
aVany one thing  tiniest thing in the creation 
p4908
aVwe do not know in its entirety 
p4909
aVthis is the fact of life 
p4910
aV well even something simple as what you started with 
p4911
aVsaying that looking at water 
p4912
aVi mean  straight away i was taught water   h2o
p4913
aVand what it can do and it
p4914
aVyou can mix it with colors and it becomes that 
p4915
aVyou can drink it and it quenches your thirst 
p4916
aVbut i never looked at it and said you know 
p4917
aV i don t really know what is water 
p4918
aV because nobody looks at anything 
p4919
aVsee  everybody is looking like this 
p4920
aVnobody has any attention for a piece of life here 
p4921
aVthey re like this  
p4922
aVif you pay attention to one life 
p4923
aVone blade of grass 
p4924
aVone grasshopper 
p4925
aVone human being 
p4926
aVsomething else will happen 
p4927
aVthat s why we said  life and love 
p4928
aVbecause if you pay attention to one human being 
p4929
aVsome love will happen within you  okay 
p4930
aVif you miss life  at least some emotion in that direction must happen to you 
p4931
aVthat will happen only if you pay attention to one 
p4932
aVif you re looking at like this 
p4933
aVthese days it s become a fashion because you re in love on facebook 
p4934
aVyou love the whole humanity 
p4935
aVto love one human being
p4936
aVif you want to love one human being  it costs life 
p4937
aVto love the whole humanity  it doesn t cost anything 
p4938
aVit s even better to love god
p4939
aVbecause it s always easy to love somebody who is not here now  
p4940
aVit s so easy 
p4941
aVbut if you have to love somebody who is sitting next to you right now 
p4942
aVit costs life 
p4943
aVyou know how difficult it is to love someone who is next to you right now 
p4944
aVhow easy it is to love someone who is dead or who is in heaven 
p4945
aVisn t it so 
p4946
aVlet s face it 
p4947
aVbecause if you have to love one 
p4948
aVone thing is you have to pay attention 
p4949
aVwithout attention  it will not happen 
p4950
aVand above all  you have to give up something that is you 
p4951
aVto accommodate another 
p4952
aVotherwise it will not happen 
p4953
aVthe english expression  it s very good  
p4954
aV you must fall in love 
p4955
aVyou cannot rise in love 
p4956
aVyou cannot stand in love 
p4957
aVyou cannot fly in love 
p4958
aVyou have to fall 
p4959
aVsomething of you should fall  otherwise it will not work 
p4960
aVyou will not know it 
p4961
aVso  you want to have a fake sense of life 
p4962
aVthen you don t pay attention to anything 
p4963
aVeverything is information 
p4964
aVnothing is a living experience 
p4965
aVeverything is from the textbook or from the cinema or from the internet 
p4966
aVnothing is from life s experience 
p4967
aVyou re doing more and more today of that 
p4968
aV sadhguruji  you just mentioned love
p4969
aVand today it is about  life and love  and i would like to know 
p4970
aVfor us it is maybe love your family members 
p4971
aVwhoever it could be  i  i
p4972
aVwhy i ask you this is because there re so many versions of this
p4973
aVand i really want to get to it 
p4974
aVsome teachers 
p4975
aVsome gurus 
p4976
aVsome guides will say you know 
p4977
aV you can love but you must be detached 
p4978
aV ohoho 
p4979
aV  you must love but it cannot be conditional 
p4980
aVit should be unconditional and
p4981
aVso  there s versions of it 
p4982
aVi just want to know 
p4983
aVso have you 
p4984
aV see  the simple  the simple way of make you keep coming back to me is
p4985
aVto give you something that you cannot do 
p4986
aVto give you a teaching which you can never do 
p4987
aVyou must love  but you must be detached  
p4988
aVnow you have to keep coming back to me for consultation  
p4989
aVendlessly 
p4990
aV  sorry 
p4991
aV i m saying throw yourself into your love affair and die into it 
p4992
aVsomething will happen 
p4993
aVsomething worthwhile will happen if you re willing to die into the process 
p4994
aVnot just anything  
p4995
aVwhether it s your work or your life or your love or whatever 
p4996
aVif you do not know how to throw your entire self into it 
p4997
aVyou will never know the taste of what it is 
p4998
aV love  but be detached 
p4999
aVwhat  why do you want to love then  
p5000
aVonly because you want to include somebody as a part of your life
p5001
aVpart of yourself  that s why you love 
p5002
aV no  i love but i  i m detached 
p5003
aVthis means you have to come back to consultation  every day 
p5004
aVit is like a psychiatrist s job
p5005
aVeveryday you have to come and sit on the couch 
p5006
aVyou need treatment and there is a fee  
p5007
aV so  okay all right 
p5008
aVso you can love and be attached
p5009
aV no  no  i didn t say that 
p5010
aV okay  i m coming back for consultation  please  
p5011
aVso  what did you say 
p5012
aV i only said 
p5013
aVsee what is this need for love in a human being 
p5014
aVyou must understand 
p5015
aVa human being constantly 
p5016
aVconstantly 
p5017
aVa human being is longing to be something more than what they are right now 
p5018
aVif this finds a simple basic physical expression 
p5019
aVwe call this sexuality 
p5020
aVsexuality means just this
p5021
aVphysically you re trying to make something which is not you  a part of yourself 
p5022
aVfor a few moments you may succeed 
p5023
aVif you try this mentally  it gets labeled as greed 
p5024
aVconquest or maybe simply shopping
p5025
aVshopping  shopping 
p5026
aV oh 
p5027
aV some people go for conquest with swords and guns 
p5028
aVsome people go with cheque books and cash  you know credit cards 
p5029
aVthe thing is you want to include something which is not a part of you as yourself
p5030
aVthat is the whole effort  tch 
p5031
aVwhether you want money or wealth or you want to occupy a nation 
p5032
aVwhat is it 
p5033
aVsomething that is not you  you want to make it yours 
p5034
aVyours is an effort to make it a part of yourself 
p5035
aVif it happens emotionally  on the emotional level if you try this 
p5036
aVwe call this a love affair 
p5037
aVyou re trying to make somebody who is not a part of you 
p5038
aVa part of yourself emotionally
p5039
aVthis is a love affair 
p5040
aVif you do it consciously  we call this yoga 
p5041
aVyoga means union 
p5042
aVso  all these efforts are fine 
p5043
aVeverything has its own beauty but has its own limitations 
p5044
aVwhen you understand the limitations of all the other methods 
p5045
aVnothing right or wrong about it 
p5046
aVit is just that it will work briefly 
p5047
aVit will not work for always 
p5048
aVwhen you realize that  you consciously try to include 
p5049
aVwhen you consciously become an inclusive process 
p5050
aVif you sit here 
p5051
aVif you experience everything as yourself then we say you are a yogi  okay 
p5052
aVso  this is a love affair  successful 
p5053
aV so something you said at the end
p5054
aVwhich i would like to ask you again
p5055
aVyou said love  inclusiveness
p5056
aVi can t understand how i can love everybody in this room 
p5057
aV you cannot 
p5058
aVthere are some people you cannot love  
p5059
aV i can barely see  up there and up there 
p5060
aVso  how is tha  how do you include everybody in your love 
p5061
aV see because you re looking at love as something that comes to you
p5062
aVor you yield to the process of love 
p5063
aVonly because you appreciate a particular quality
p5064
aVa shape of somebody s nose or the shape of their mind
p5065
aVor their thought or their emotion or the way they speak
p5066
aVor the way they do things or the way they relate to you 
p5067
aVsomething  okay 
p5068
aVthere re many many things 
p5069
aVit is based on something that is acceptable to you 
p5070
aVif they do something that is not acceptable to you 
p5071
aVlove crumbles 
p5072
aV  yes 
p5073
aV now what i m saying is 
p5074
aVi want you to look at this  
p5075
aVwhether love happens to you or hate happens to you 
p5076
aVanger happens to you  misery happens to you  joy happens to you
p5077
aVit only happens within you  isn t it 
p5078
ag4874
aV it never  people say love is in the air 
p5079
aVno 
p5080
aVbecause you are feeling very pleasant in your emotions 
p5081
aVsuddenly air feels vibrant 
p5082
aVit always been  you missed it all your life 
p5083
aVnow you re beginning to feel it 
p5084
aV  okay  okay 
p5085
aV all right  so  whatever human experience  
p5086
aVlove or hate  whatever  whatever  
p5087
aVhappens only within you 
p5088
aVwhat i am saying is at least what happens within you must happen by your choice 
p5089
aVconsciously you must be able to make it happen 
p5090
aVif you re able to 
p5091
aVif your experience or what is happening within you is happening by choice 
p5092
aVwhat is the problem 
p5093
aVit only happens within you 
p5094
aVlove is not a relationship 
p5095
aVa relationship is a different thing 
p5096
aVlove is a certain sweetness of your emotion 
p5097
aVwhether you look at a tree or a dog or a man or a woman or a child or just at the sky 
p5098
aVwhy can t you look at it lovingly 
p5099
aVbecause it s not about loving the sky 
p5100
aVit s about the sweetness of your emotion 
p5101
aVif your emotions are sweet 
p5102
aVwhatever you look at  you will look at it in a certain way 
p5103
aVright now you have nasty emotions  whatever you look at 
p5104
aVyou look at it in a different way 
p5105
aVso  you have always associated love with somebody 
p5106
aVno  no  no  this is not about somebody
p5107
aVlove is not something that you do 
p5108
aVit is something that you can become 
p5109
aVif you re willing  you can become love 
p5110
aVyou can make your emotion into a very sweet space 
p5111
aVif you make your mind
p5112
aVif you make your body very pleasant  it becomes pleasure 
p5113
aVif you sit here  it can be great pleasure just sitting here and breathing 
p5114
aVif your mind becomes pleasant  we say this is joy 
p5115
aVif your emotions become pleasant  we say this is love 
p5116
aVif your very life energies become pleasant  we say this is blissfulness  this is ecstasy 
p5117
aVif your surroundings become pleasant  we call that success 
p5118
aVnow you re calling your success with somebody as love  that s a mistake 
p5119
aVyou have a success story with somebody   that is 
p5120
aVyou have created pleasantness in the atmosphere between you and let s say five ten people around you 
p5121
aVyou re calling that love 
p5122
aVno that is actually success because that needs lots of management 
p5123
aV yes  it does 
p5124
aV yes or no 
p5125
aV yes it does 
p5126
aV yes  but for you to be loving  there is no management 
p5127
aVif you just make your emotions sweet 
p5128
aVyour emotions are sweet and it s beautiful be  be like this 
p5129
aVit s not about anybody 
p5130
aVif somebody comes  we can share it 
p5131
aVif nobody comes  you can sit here with eyes closed and still be loving 
p5132
aVwhat s the problem 
p5133
aVit is not about somebody  it s not an action 
p5134
aVit is not something that you do 
p5135
aVit is something that you can become  
p5136
aV it s a  it s a lovely  idyllic
p5137
aV it is not idyllic  it is  it is the way it is 
p5138
aV it is  i mean you d really have to practice this 
p5139
aV why 
p5140
aV because i m thinking
p5141
aV see  this is what exactly i m saying
p5142
aVif it is an action 
p5143
aVan action comes to perfection with practice  only if it s an action 
p5144
aVi m saying love is not an act 
p5145
aVis health an act 
p5146
aVare you acting healthy right now 
p5147
aV no 
p5148
aV i know you re an actor  but are you acting healthy 
p5149
aV  no 
p5150
aV so health is  because
p5151
ag4874
aV  you have done certain things and health is  isn t it 
p5152
aV oh  we ve not done certain things
p5153
aV oh  we have definite
p5154
aV  we ve been given
p5155
aV no  no  no  no  oh  we ve been given  but if you eat bad 
p5156
aVif you live bad  you won t be healthy 
p5157
aV hmm 
p5158
aV we ve done certain things to manage our health 
p5159
aVsimilarly  if you do certain things 
p5160
aVyou can manage the pleasantness of your mind 
p5161
aVif you do certain other things  you can manage the pleasantness of your emotion 
p5162
aVif you do certain other things  you can manage the pleasantness of your very life energies 
p5163
aVthis is things that you can do 
p5164
aVnow  what you can do internally  you re trying to manage externally 
p5165
aVwhat can be done here within you 
p5166
aVyou are trying to manage by creating an atmosphere around you
p5167
aVwhich is a very difficult thing to do 
p5168
aVbecause outside will never happen hundred percent the way you want it 
p5169
aVto some extent we can manage 
p5170
aVwe can t do all of it by ourselves
p5171
aVbecause there are many forces involved 
p5172
aV sadhguruji  you said something about health 
p5173
aVand you said  you do certain things for yourself  certain things 
p5174
aVone   you re given health and then how you maintain it is you eat well 
p5175
aVyou exercise and you remain healthy 
p5176
aVnow  to be loving when maybe in a household 
p5177
aVany situation 
p5178
aVmaybe outside  like you said  outside forces are not pleasant
p5179
aVit doesn t come easily to then just be loving 
p5180
aVso  what is the practice to become that way
p5181
aVor to train yourself to be that way 
p5182
aV i  i want to remove this idea from your mind 
p5183
aVyou believe you need to practice 
p5184
aVpractice means you re trying to perfet
p5185
aVperfect an action  isn t it 
p5186
aV to be loving at all times
p5187
aV yes  yes that s not an act 
p5188
aV no  not an act  but to be so accepting
p5189
aV no  i don t want to
p5190
aVi don t want to go back to the movies  okay  
p5191
aV no  to be so accepting because
p5192
aV no  it s not about accepting 
p5193
aVright now  do you want to keep your mind
p5194
aVyour thought process pleasant or nasty 
p5195
aVtell me  what is your choice 
p5196
aV ideally pleasant 
p5197
aV just tell me  pleasant or nasty 
p5198
aVyou re thinking about it  this is
p5199
aV no  i am trying to think
p5200
aVshould i fox you and say nasty  
p5201
aV  say it 
p5202
aV  okay  nasty 
p5203
aV i m going to bless you now  
p5204
aV no  no  no 
p5205
aVokay i take back my words  
p5206
aVokay  all right  so
p5207
aV any human being s choice for themselves is definitely pleasantness  isn't it 
p5208
ag4874
aV body  mind  emotion  everything and surroundings
p5209
aVyou want it pleasant 
p5210
ag4874
aV so why is it not pleasant 
p5211
aVsurroundings are not pleasant because of many things
p5212
ag4874
aV if your thought and emotion are not pleasant 
p5213
aVit s entirely you  isn t it 
p5214
ag4874
aV surroundings   not entirely me  it s so many forces 
p5215
aVwe have to manage them 
p5216
aVwe have to juggle them 
p5217
aVnot always are we successful with everything around us 
p5218
aVyou know different people have different levels of competence to manage the outside 
p5219
aVnot all of us have the same  what to say 
p5220
aVthe skill to manage the outside 
p5221
aVbut inside  your emotion and your thought 
p5222
aVwhy is it not happening your way 
p5223
aVthis is something we have to look at 
p5224
aVthis has to be addressed 
p5225
aVevery human being has to address this 
p5226
aVat least your thought and your emotion must happen the way you want it 
p5227
aVon a certain day  a lady went to sleep 
p5228
aVa lady went to sleep 
p5229
aVin her sleep   she had a dream 
p5230
aVi think up there   
p5231
aVoh there are two strata of people  nobody is asleep right  
p5232
aVso that i could pick on you  i m just looking if i can see 
p5233
aVshe went to sleep  up there 
p5234
aVand in her dream  she had a dream 
p5235
aVin her dream she saw a hunk of a man standing in that corner 
p5236
aVand then he started coming closer and closer and closer 
p5237
aVhe came so close she could even feel his breath 
p5238
aVshe trembled  not in fear and then she asked 
p5239
aV what will you do to me 
p5240
aVthe man said   well lady  it s your dream  
p5241
aV okay 
p5242
aV i m saying what s happening in your mind is your bloody dream 
p5243
aVnow the problem with life is  
p5244
aVnot that life is not happening the way you want it 
p5245
aVeven your dream is not happening the way you want it 
p5246
aVthat s the problem  
p5247
aVi m saying at least fix this 
p5248
aVat least let the dream happen the way you want it 
p5249
aVif you were dreaming the way you want right now 
p5250
aVyour thought and your emotion would be pleasant  isn t it 
p5251
aV yes  but it  well
p5252
aV fixing the world is another thing  that s a different game 
p5253
aVthat needs lot of skill 
p5254
aVthis needs just willingness 
p5255
aVwhy we re continuously talking about joy  blissfulness  love 
p5256
aVis not because it s a goal by itself 
p5257
aVthese are not goals by itself
p5258
aVonly by  when you are pleasant by your own nature 
p5259
aVyou stop being in pursuit of happiness 
p5260
aVyou are fine by yourself 
p5261
aVyou don t have to go anywhere to feel pleasant 
p5262
aVyou don t have to do anything to feel pleasant 
p5263
aVsitting here you re feeling very pleasant 
p5264
aVnow you will look at life the way it is 
p5265
aVotherwise  you re an endless race 
p5266
aVpursuit of your happiness is a lifelong thing 
p5267
aVtill your deathbed you re pursuing 
p5268
aVwhat does it mean 
p5269
aVif you re pursuing happiness when you are five  i can understand 
p5270
aVbut that was not the fact 
p5271
aVwhen you re five you were simply happy by your own nature 
p5272
aVwhen you re fifty  you re pursuing your happiness
p5273
aVthis is a failed story  isn t it 
p5274
aV but  sadhguruji  suppose we say this to the common man 
p5275
aVwho has a little house
p5276
aV where did you meet a common man 
p5277
aV  i m imagining it 
p5278
aV every man or woman think they re special  believe me
p5279
aV oh yes 
p5280
aV yes  so where did you meet a common man  i m asking  
p5281
aV okay  sadhguruji when you said about the common person and the special person 
p5282
aVi know some teachers have always told us
p5283
aVand why your own parents always tell you that you know  
p5284
aVyou are special 
p5285
aVeach one of us is unique
p5286
aVand i remember this part 
p5287
aVi am not sure whether i heard it at your discourse or on a dvd of yours 
p5288
aVwhere you said  it was about you know people being special
p5289
aVand us always thinking that god knows of us 
p5290
aVand you said something like 
p5291
aV do you know all the grasshoppers in your garden 
p5292
aVso  of course all of us have said   no 
p5293
aVso  you said something like 
p5294
aV so  how does god know each one of you then 
p5295
aVand i was devastated because i always thought
p5296
aVsomebody up there knows me  cares about me and i m special 
p5297
aV you thought  you thought you re number
p5298
aVyou thought you were number one on his books  is it 
p5299
aV well  i ve been told since i was kid 
p5300
aV you re special  you re unique and god cares about you 
p5301
aV let me tell  tch  tch  tch  see  if when somebody says you re unique 
p5302
aVit s an insult   you know
p5303
aV no  you said   no top line  so you re
p5304
ag5242
aV  peaking in different ways 
p5305
aV in this vast cosmos  this solar system is just a speck 
p5306
aVtomorrow morning if the whole solar system disappears  vanishes  evaporates 
p5307
aVnobody will even notice it 
p5308
aVmaybe it s not even in the accounts books of creation 
p5309
aVit s so small 
p5310
aVin this speck of a solar system 
p5311
aVplanet earth is a super speck 
p5312
aVin that  mumbai is a micro super speck 
p5313
aVin that  you are a big man or a woman  
p5314
aVthis is a huge problem 
p5315
aVthis is a very immense existential problem  you know  
p5316
aVthis is because we have lost perspective as to who we are  what we are 
p5317
aVour psychological realities have become bigger than the cosmo  than the cosmic reality 
p5318
aVthat is the big problem 
p5319
aVit s time you step out of your cinema
p5320
aVi m  i m not talking about the hindi cinema 
p5321
aVi m talking about the cinema that everybody is playing in their own minds 
p5322
aVsee  see right now they darkened this whole hall
p5323
aVbecause it works best that way 
p5324
aVthis is the basic technology of a cinema 
p5325
aVif you do not darken the cinema hall 
p5326
aVif you light it up and play a nice cinema  it s not going to work 
p5327
aVyou have to darken it 
p5328
aVso  i m saying  a cinema of your mind because it s a dark space 
p5329
aVevery thought is enlarged 
p5330
aVplaying out bigger than the cosmic space 
p5331
aVtoday  everything in the cosmos is happening perfectly well 
p5332
aVbut you have one nasty thought crawling in your head
p5333
aVand it feels like a bad day  isn t it 
p5334
aV yes  yes 
p5335
aV so  that s because your psychological realities 
p5336
aVyour petty creation has become larger than the creator s creation 
p5337
aVyou lost perspective of life 
p5338
aVthat is the fundamental basis of all this confusion and suffering 
p5339
aVif you see who you are 
p5340
aVthe micro speck that you are 
p5341
aVyou wouldn t imagine that god is made in your own image
p5342
aVand he looks like you and whatever 
p5343
aVokay  if  if we were all buffalos 
p5344
aVwe would definitely think god is a big buffalo  
p5345
aV okay  okay  so what is it really 
p5346
aVplease tell us the  please define it for us 
p5347
ag5033
aVwhat is going on   this life  this love 
p5348
aVall these emotions that we go through in our lives 
p5349
aVall these thoughts that we create for ourselves 
p5350
aVwhat is going on 
p5351
aV see  these are all human possibilities and capabilities 
p5352
aVevery possibility becomes a problem
p5353
aVfor those who do not explore the possibility in its right perspective 
p5354
aVthought is a tremendous possibility 
p5355
aVan ant cannot think like you 
p5356
aVhe can work better than you 
p5357
aVhe s more disciplined 
p5358
aVhe betters main  better traffic rules than you 
p5359
aVthere s no traffic jam out there  
p5360
aVokay but he cannot think like you 
p5361
ag4874
aV that sets up apart 
p5362
aVthis is a possibility 
p5363
aVbut now  this possibility has become a problem for ninety percent of the humanity 
p5364
aVnow they re freaking because they can think
p5365
aVand they re thinking all the wrong things 
p5366
aVtheir thoughts have become nasty 
p5367
aVif they were pleasant they would have enjoyed their thought process 
p5368
aVbecause it s become nasty  it s becoming a ailment  isn t it 
p5369
aVpeople are suffering their thoughts immensely 
p5370
aVbecause they do not know how to keep it pleasant 
p5371
aVnothing has been done towards it 
p5372
aVso  what is a possibility always becomes a problem
p5373
aVif you do not explore it in the right perspective 
p5374
aVso your thought and emotion has become a problem 
p5375
aVnow love affair is a problem 
p5376
aVyou re making all kinds of things out of it 
p5377
aVwhich are all coming from this misunderstanding 
p5378
aVnot understanding this thought and emotion is generated by me 
p5379
aVi can generate it whichever way i want 
p5380
aVif nastiness is what you like  you do it 
p5381
aVi don t care if that s what you like
p5382
aVbut you re suffering it 
p5383
aVif you re suffering it  you shouldn t be doing it 
p5384
aVi am not telling you   be loving 
p5385
aVwhat is your choice  
p5386
aVpleasantness or unpleasantness 
p5387
aVif unpleasantness is your choice  you enjoy it and do it 
p5388
aVwhat s my problem 
p5389
aVyou want to drink poison  what is my problem 
p5390
aVi am just telling you this is poison  this is this  
p5391
aVdrink whatever you want  but by choice 
p5392
aVdon t drink unconsciously  that s stupid 
p5393
aVthat s not befitting of a human being 
p5394
aVa human being means we are far more conscious than every other creature on this planet  
p5395
aVthat s what sets us apart 
p5396
aVevery creature eats but we can eat consciously 
p5397
aVso our eating becomes so many things 
p5398
aVevery creature has sexual drives 
p5399
aVthey go and fulfill it whichever way 
p5400
aVwe can do it consciously 
p5401
aVso  we become something  something 
p5402
aVwe re doing the same things but we re doing it consciously 
p5403
aVsuddenly there is a magic about it 
p5404
aVnot because sex is magic  food is magic  no 
p5405
aVbecause we can do it consciously 
p5406
aVevery basic act like eating and copulating becomes magical
p5407
ag5406
aVif you leave that one thing 
p5408
aVif you exclude that one thing from your life
p5409
aVthat you are not conscious about the way you think 
p5410
aVthe way you feel 
p5411
aVthe way you act 
p5412
aVthe way you move your body  
p5413
aVif you re not conscious about it 
p5414
aVeverything can turn ugly 
p5415
aVeverything can become nasty 
p5416
aVso it is this which sets you apart from every other creature 
p5417
aVso  a dog is walking on the street 
p5418
aVif you show it a biscuit it will wag its tail 
p5419
aVif you do this   grrr it will do 
p5420
aVif this is what you are that
p5421
aVif somebody is nice to you 
p5422
aVyou will wag your whatever 
p5423
aVif somebody is not nice to you  you will bite them  i m saying what
p5424
aVwhere is evolution in you 
p5425
aVforget about civilization  i m  talking about evolution 
p5426
aVwhere s the evolution 
p5427
aVwhere s the sign of evolution i m asking  
p5428
aV okay  sadhguruji let s go to  hmm
p5429
aV i ve seen people copying answers in examination but never questions
p5430
aV yeah questions  
p5431
aVwell 
p5432
aVtoday  many women in our modern society are stepping out and having a career
p5433
aVand i just like to know  what do you think of this
p5434
aVof women stepping out  being career people  managing home as well 
p5435
aVbeing financially independent 
p5436
aVis this good 
p5437
aV see every woman should do what she wants to do as an individual person 
p5438
aVit should not be made into a trend in a society or the only right thing to do in the world
p5439
aVbecause i think if  if a woman is
p5440
aVintends to have two children and raise them 
p5441
aVi think it s a full time job 
p5442
aVi m not saying she should not go out and work 
p5443
aVif she wishes to  as an individual person  she s free to do what she wants to do 
p5444
aVbut having two children is not about reproduction 
p5445
aVyou re manufacturing the next generation of people 
p5446
aVhow the world will be tomorrow 
p5447
aVwill be determined by what kind of mothers you have today 
p5448
aVbelieve me 
p5449
aVyou know  i ve seen many ladies coming to me and say 
p5450
aVwhen i ask  what re you doing 
p5451
aV oh i m just a housewife 
p5452
aVi said   why do you say  you re just a housewife 
p5453
aVyou  you don t seem to understand the significance of 
p5454
aVyou know  being able to nurture two or three new lives 
p5455
aVit s not  it s not a  not important  job  it s a very important job 
p5456
aVcareer   i want you to understand
p5457
aVright now because we have made the whole world into economics
p5458
aVunfortunately women also getting as stupid as men 
p5459
aVas if how much money you earn is going to determine the value of your life 
p5460
ag5080
aVit is just procurement of things that you need 
p5461
aVmoney is just about that 
p5462
aVman was procuring 
p5463
aVwoman was taking about the more beautiful aspects of life 
p5464
aVnow woman also wants to procure 
p5465
aVif there is such an economic need in the family  fine she must do it 
p5466
aVbut it is not a compulsive need 
p5467
aVit must not be set up as something better to do than doing something 
p5468
aVif she sings so  if she  if she plays music or if she just loves her children
p5469
aVor if she cooks beautifully
p5470
aVor she just lives beautifully like a flower 
p5471
aVit s good enough  i m saying 
p5472
aVit is not necessary that only if she earns this much money  she s  her  she s doing something valuable 
p5473
aVotherwise she s not 
p5474
aVif there s an economic need  she can do it 
p5475
aVor if she has a passion for doing it  she can do it 
p5476
aVbut  let not such values be set up in the world because you re not evolving 
p5477
aVyou re regressing 
p5478
aVyou re making survival more important than aesthetics of life  
p5479
aV okay sadhguruji  let me take you away from this
p5480
aVand let me take you to a world of say films where i come from
p5481
aV world of films  okay  let s go  let s go movies  
p5482
aV years ago when films started
p5483
aVand you know through the sixties  seventies there were lovely stories 
p5484
aVnice values  beautiful music  lyrics 
p5485
aVby the time i was the star in movies some of our jhatka matka s might have shocked the previous generations
p5486
aVand they must have said what is all this 
p5487
aVbut it was still within limits
p5488
aV whose limits  
p5489
aV i mean what s acceptable to society  whatever have been 
p5490
aVi ll say  and then now today the complexion of films 
p5491
aVthe kind of films we see 
p5492
aVyou know it s little clothed 
p5493
aVit s live in relationships
p5494
aVor you know up there on screen for everybody to see and night club culture 
p5495
aVi mean it sometimes worries me
p5496
aVthat my children are growing up now
p5497
aVthis is what they re seeing  this is
p5498
aVthese are the kind of songs that they re listening to 
p5499
aVthe lyrics are about you know
p5500
aV from janam janam to expiry date is the song  
p5501
aV yes  so this is the
p5502
aVthis is what they re watching  this is what they think is cool 
p5503
aVthis is  this is the hip and happening stuff  i m little
p5504
aV i think by the time you came the janam janam was over  isn t it  
p5505
aV no  it was still there  it was in the middle somewhere 
p5506
aVthe music was wonderful  the lyrics was still lovely
p5507
aVbut today it is munni badhnaam ho gayi and it things
p5508
aVthings have really moved to chewing gums
p5509
aVand i m forgetting at this moment what the lyrics are but then its  its
p5510
aVits  shallow right now 
p5511
aVindia has the youngest population in the world right now
p5512
aVso with such a young nation growing up on this  this is the feed
p5513
aVi m just a little concerned as to what they will turn out to be 
p5514
aV i m sure your parents were concerned too 
p5515
aV they   okay  so  can i
p5516
aV i m sure my parents were very concerned when i was growing up 
p5517
aVso  every parent has this concern  every generation has this concern
p5518
aVthat the next generation is going wrong always 
p5519
aVi understand what you re saying
p5520
aVthis sudden change if every generation likes to go
p5521
aVone step beyond where the previous generation has stepped in  on eve
p5522
aValmost everything just for the sake of doing something different or it s natural they ve grown up in one atmosphere
p5523
aVthey take it to another level 
p5524
aV they move to the next level 
p5525
aV yes  next is not always next  that s what you re saying 
p5526
aVnext is not always next  right 
p5527
aV yes  it s not higher
p5528
ag5242
aV it s somewhere else  it s just  it s
p5529
aV it s just next 
p5530
aVso  this concern is always there but
p5531
aVright now the change that is happening is not the next
p5532
aVit is a serious influence because
p5533
aVin the last fifteen years the world s ability to communicate across cultures and borders
p5534
aVis so heavy and so unprecedented 
p5535
aVnobody has ever been used to these kind of influences before 
p5536
aVokay  never before this level of influence on our young people
p5537
aVnever before possible
p5538
aVno other generation has ever experienced this kind of onslaught from so many directions
p5539
aVand the volume of influence is too big 
p5540
aVso in terms of changes are happening not 
p5541
aVit is not next
p5542
aVit is simply somewhere and nobody knows where it is
p5543
aVbecause it s too complex and too mixed 
p5544
aVnobody knows where it is including the young people 
p5545
aVit s just a mix of things 
p5546
aVso this is because of a sudden onslaught of information and communication 
p5547
aVit s not for us to judge whether it s good or bad 
p5548
aVit is just that definitely this level of information  
p5549
aVwhen i say information 
p5550
aVit s like when we were growing up
p5551
aVi believe it was true for your generation also
p5552
aVwe  we never knew what is boredom  okay 
p5553
aVthis was  there was no such thing 
p5554
aVwe were just excited about everything that came our way 
p5555
aVbut you see today twelve year old kids 
p5556
aVif you tell them what   ahhm 
p5557
aV yes  
p5558
aV you see they re just bored because
p5559
aVthey know the whole cosmos there it s
p5560
aVthey have seen it on their phone screen not even on a computer screen 
p5561
aVon the phone screen they ve seen the entire cosmos 
p5562
aVthey know everything 
p5563
aVthings that you do not know they know 
p5564
aVyou ask them they know it 
p5565
ag4874
aV by information
p5566
aVby the time they re eighteen they have had five love affairs and gone  
p5567
aVin the western world it s like that here also it s beginning to happen  okay 
p5568
aVso by the time they re eighteen they ve seen everything that you need to see
p5569
aVwith body  mind  emotion  okay 
p5570
aVby the time they re twenty five what 
p5571
aVwhat next 
p5572
aV what next  yes 
p5573
aV no  you will see  this is not my wish
p5574
aVbut this is something that i see the way people s minds are working 
p5575
aVthe way they re being led in with information  
p5576
aVi m not a  by any standards a pessimistic person
p5577
aVbut i m just seeing this
p5578
aVif this level of information continues and it will multiply many fold
p5579
aVfor the coming generations 
p5580
aVyou should not be surprised
p5581
aVin the next fifty to hundred years
p5582
aVif fifty percent of the human population choose to commit suicide
p5583
ag5581
aVbecause that is what will happen to the mind  
p5584
aVsomebody is clapping  look at this it s popular  
p5585
aV no you have just touched a chord and that s
p5586
aV no  i m saying
p5587
aV we think we realize something 
p5588
aV today  today
p5589
aVthis day more people commit suicide in this world
p5590
aVthan all the wars and murders and accidents manage to kill 
p5591
aVso more people are on self help already than
p5592
aVmurderers  war mongers  bad drivers  everything put together 
p5593
aVmore people are on self help 
p5594
aVand if this level of information onslaught continues on human mind  
p5595
aVi know the nature of mind absolutely because i know my mind 
p5596
aVi know how it works  what it can handle  what it cannot do 
p5597
aVi know it clearly what human mind is 
p5598
aVthat s the reason why i don t have to read people s books
p5599
aVor listen to their entire thing
p5600
aVif they say one sentence i know what their mind is
p5601
aVbecause i know the structure of human mind entirely 
p5602
aVotherwise i wouldn t be who i am 
p5603
aVso i m saying this 
p5604
aVif this level of information onslaught continues at the same phase or at higher phase 
p5605
aVwhich is possible in the next few years 
p5606
aVthis will definitely lead to wanting to terminate yourself
p5607
aVbecause there would be nothing to live for 
p5608
aVthere is no joy and excitement about anything 
p5609
aVyou please watch your children
p5610
aVby the time they re twelve  fifteen they re just bored 
p5611
aVyou look back at your own life those of you who are over fifty years of age
p5612
aVjust look back at in  or  on your own life 
p5613
aVwhen you were twelve  fifteen
p5614
aVwas there any room for you to get bored about anything 
p5615
aVsimply you are excited about every little thing  isn t it 
p5616
aV yeah 
p5617
aV today you will see it s almost a common feature
p5618
aVtwelve  fifteen year old kids are just bored only thing is  
p5619
aV yes  they are all on ipad s and iphones  yes  they are on gadgets 
p5620
aV because we re talking about love and life  
p5621
aVall this will not mean nothing because you had one love affair when you were eighteen years of age 
p5622
aVyou thought this is your life and you re going to  willing to die for it 
p5623
aVwhether you died for it or not but at least at that time you thought you ll die for it  okay 
p5624
aVtoday by the  on facebook they had twenty two love affairs going simultaneously  
p5625
aVit just means nothing 
p5626
aVi  i m not saying they should have it or not have it 
p5627
aVall i m saying is this will lead to a certain overload on the mind
p5628
aVand suddenly a human being will think why am i here 
p5629
aVyou know that big shakespearian question
p5630
aV to be or not to be 
p5631
ag4874
aV this is not the most intelligent question  
p5632
aVunfortunately people think so
p5633
aVthis is only because you have not been touched by life 
p5634
aVyou are not a piece of life 
p5635
aVyou re just a psychological case 
p5636
aVyou are full of thoughts and emotions 
p5637
aVyou have not touched life at all 
p5638
aVyou think your thoughts and la  emotions are life 
p5639
ag5080
aVyour thoughts and emotions are the drama that you are creating in your mind 
p5640
aVit is your cinema 
p5641
aVyou must be able to end it somewhere 
p5642
aVif you do not know how to put  the end  then it s going on endless cinema you re going crazy 
p5643
aVlife is happening here 
p5644
aVyou know your work is not life 
p5645
aVyour family is not life  your career is not life 
p5646
aVyour cinema is not life  your thought is not life 
p5647
aVyour emotion is not life 
p5648
ag5644
aVeverything else is accessories to life 
p5649
aVnow the frills of life have become larger than life itself 
p5650
aVlife is entirely missed 
p5651
aVif you touch life within you  then it s an explosion of energy 
p5652
aVwhen such a thing never happens to you 
p5653
aVbecause you have information about the whole cosmos on your phone screen 
p5654
aVyou ll never be touched by life because too much information  too much thought 
p5655
aVeven emotion is drying up  too much thought 
p5656
aVthis has happened 
p5657
aVif you look at european philosophy in the last hundred  hundred and fifty years
p5658
aVyou will see if you read dostoyevsky you will want to commit suicide 
p5659
aVbrilliant  intellectually brilliant
p5660
aVbut you will wonder why are you alive
p5661
aVbecause intellect is like that  if you wake up in the morning
p5662
aVdevoid of any  touching any life s experience within you
p5663
aVdon t think about your child s face 
p5664
aVdo not think about the flowers in the garden 
p5665
aVbirds in the sky 
p5666
aVnothing beautiful that ever touched you
p5667
aVjust think logically you have to get out of bed that s not a small feat 
p5668
aVyou have to brush your teeth  breakfast  go to work  eat  work  eat  sleep
p5669
aVagain tomorrow morning same thing 
p5670
aVnext fifty years you have to do the same process every day 
p5671
aVif you look at it one hundred percent logically and intellectually
p5672
aVyou will have no reason to live today morning
p5673
aVtomorrow morning 
p5674
aVit s only if you re touched by something suddenly it s worth living 
p5675
aVif you re not touched by anything then it s not worth living 
p5676
aVwhat is  what is so worth living about a human being  
p5677
aVwaking up in the morning 
p5678
aVtotking  tro  tr  you know troding  through life 
p5679
aVtrudging through life everyday eating  sleeping  same rubbish 
p5680
aVwhat is the point 
p5681
aVthere is no point  unless you re touched by something 
p5682
aVsome magic of life if it doesn t touch you either in the form of love
p5683
aVor in the form of a flower or in the form of something within you 
p5684
aVif something doesn t sparkle within you definitely there is a question
p5685
aVwhether i should live or not  isn t it 
p5686
aVand we are taking humanity in that direction with this overload of information 
p5687
aVinformation is not knowing 
p5688
aVinformation is just garbage collection 
p5689
aVyou just gather things which don t mean anything to you 
p5690
aVyou look smart in a tea party but you re not smart with life 
p5691
aVokay 
p5692
aVif you re smart with life you must be blissful  isn t it  
p5693
aVif you re really smart with life you must be joyful and blissful  isn t it so 
p5694
aVyou re only smart in a tea party
p5695
aVbecause you know when somebody is talking something 
p5696
aV you know the galaxy z22 
p5697
aVwhat happens there 
p5698
aVeverybody   wow  
p5699
aVthey can also open the internet and the same thing 
p5700
aVyou see  you think this guy visited the galaxy  
p5701
aV so sadhguruji then what is it 
p5702
aVokay so for all of us 
p5703
aVgive us in clear simple  simple sentences  
p5704
aVdo this and you will be at least on the way to be blissful or happy or aware or
p5705
aVliving in a nice conscious way  
p5706
aV see if you  if you just observe 
p5707
aVif everybody makes a little effort 
p5708
aVeverybody take a little time for this piece of life  okay 
p5709
aVnot for your family 
p5710
aVnot for your career 
p5711
aVnot for something else  something else 
p5712
aVjust for this piece of life give it little time
p5713
aVbecause this is the most important piece of life in your life  isn t it 
p5714
aVyes or no 
p5715
ag4874
aV even if you re in love with somebody  
p5716
aVstill this is the most important piece of life  isn t it 
p5717
aVso pay some attention to this 
p5718
aVhow does it happen  why have you taken it for granted 
p5719
aVbelieve me you re not going to be here for an ever 
p5720
aVi ll bless you with a long life but you re going to fall dead one day  
p5721
ag5715
ag4874
aV so do not take this for granted 
p5722
aVif you wake up in the morning
p5723
aVtomorrow if you wake up in the morning 
p5724
aVno this is not my wish but i want you to know
p5725

aVis it not a fantastic thing 
p5729
aVa million people did not wake up

ag5335
aV you don t seem to think so
p5745
aVbecause the problem is just this you are living with an idea that you are immortal 
p5746
aVwhen i say you re immortal 
p5747
aVyou re not actually thinking you re immortal
p5748
aVbut you re not conscious of your mortality 
p5749
aVif you re not conscious of your mortality 
p5750
aVsomewhere you think you re immortal  isn t it 
p5751
aVhow many moments in a day are you conscious that you re mortal 
p5752
aVif you were conscious would you have time to crib 
p5753
aVwould you have time to fight with somebody 
p5754
aVwould you have time to do some rubbish with your life 
p5755
aVif you knew
p5756
aVif you re conscious that you are mortal you would do nothing
p5757
aVother than what is absolutely needed for you and everybody around you 
p5758
aVthis one thing if you do
p5759
aVif you just remind yourself you
p5760
aVdon t think this is a negative thing 
p5761
aVdeath is not a negative thing  it s the only thing which has added value to your life 
p5762
aVif you re here forever you would be unbearable  
p5763
aV yeah   yes  yes 
p5764
aV isn t it 
p5765
aVaren t we glad everybody dies one day  
p5766
aVif you just become conscious of this one thing
p5767
aVthat always you re conscious that  i m mortal 
p5768
aVyou don t have to think  i will die today 
p5769
aVwe don t intend  we want to live as far as possible 
p5770
aVjust you know  one day i will die 
p5771
aVif you re just conscious of this one thing
p5772
aVyou will naturally become spiritual 
p5773
aVyou will not become spiritual by thinking about god 
p5774
aVyou will become unrealistic  hallucinatory  you will start talking to somebody 
p5775
aVyou will start doing all kinds of things 
p5776
aValready people  you know they have ear phones on and they re talking
p5777
aVyou don t know whether they ve lost it or they  
p5778
aVten years ago if somebody was walking on the street talking you would know that he s lost
p5779
aVbut today you don t know  
p5780
aVwhether they got their head phones on
p5781
aVor they just lost it and they re talking  we cannot make out 
p5782
aVbut if you are conscious that you re mortal every moment of your life 
p5783
aVspiritual process has begun for you 
p5784
aVso the one  one of the main reasons 
p5785
aVone of the fundamental reasons why that all these things have to be taught to you that she is repeatedly asking this question
p5786
aV were you born special  did you have normal birth or not  is simply because
p5787
aVmost people have forgotten they are mortal 
p5788
aVthey think they re immortal  they may not actually think they re immortal
p5789
aVbut they re not conscious they are mortal 
p5790
aVwith every step with every breath if they were conscious of this 
p5791
aVyou know how consciously they would live 
p5792
aVthey would become fantastic  it is your mortality which makes you  want to know what is the nature of your existence 
p5793
aVyou really want to know where you came from  where you will go only when it sinks into you
p5794
aVall this drama pup   one day it will end
p5795
aVbut right now you think only others appear in obituary columns 
p5796
aVyou are only going to read it  
p5797
aV that was  that was simply beautiful 
p5798
aV that s all that s needed
p5799
aVif you want to know the value of life
p5800
aVjust know that it s a brief happening 
p5801
aVthe time that you spend here as life it s a very relative experience 
p5802
aVif you re truly joyful and ecstatic  it s horribly brief  believe me 
p5803
aVi feel like i was born day before yesterday 
p5804
aVsee already how i have become    okay 
p5805
aV  yes  yes 
p5806
aV but on a particular day if you re depressed or miserable 
p5807
aVone day seems like an endless thing 
p5808
aVso  only miserable people have a looooooooong life  
p5809
aVif you re a joyful  ecstatic person life is always brief 
p5810
aVif you live to be hundred it s still very brief 
p5811
aVfor what possibilities a human being carries  for the immensity of what a human being is  
p5812
aVit s too brief a life 
p5813
aVif you re given hundred years  two hundred years it s still  still too brief
p5814
aVbecause before you know what s happening before you exp  exp  explore a few dimensions of life it ll be over 
p5815
aVit ll be over  over  okay 
p5816
aVonly miserable people have a very long life 
p5817
aVthey feel it s very long  
p5818
aV sadhguruji here we have a few questions
p5819
aVthe first stion is from prabhas sundaras  sundar sen  
p5820
aVwhere and how do we draw the line between loving unconditionally
p5821
aVand becoming a doormat  
p5822
aV see we need to understand this  
p5823
aVwhat s being right now passed around as love is generally a mutual benefit scheme
p5824
aVyou give me this  i ll give you that 
p5825
aVif you don t give me that i don t give you this
p5826
aVthis is not said but it s done  
p5827
aV okay  
p5828
aV it s done  isn t it 
p5829
aVit s not said 
p5830
aVso  human beings have physical  psychological  emotional  economic  social
p5831
aVand various other kinds of needs 
p5832
aVto fulfill these things
p5833
aVwhen you say  i love you 
p5834
aVinstead of making these things ugly needs that we have to
p5835
aVugly transactions that we have to do   you give me this  you give me that
p5836
aVto bring some aesthetic and beauty to this transaction 
p5837
aVwe quote it with a certain amount of sweetness of emotion
p5838
aVwhich we call as love affair
p5839
aVwhere the transactions happen more smoothly
p5840
aVbecause once we are human somehow doing basic transactions in a basic way makes us feel ugly 
p5841
aVif you take food with both your hands and eat it  it s ugly  isn t it 
p5842
aVwe want to eat in a certain way 
p5843
aVsimilarly to fulfill our physical needs 
p5844
aVemotional needs  economic needs we have arrangements 
p5845
aVwhere we can conduct this in a more aesthetic manner 
p5846
aVi m not saying it s right or wrong  this is the fact of life 
p5847
aVso  this level of love 
p5848
aVi call this
p5849
aVthis is enough for  to fulfill the domestic needs of one s
p5850
aVyou know for two people to live together 
p5851
aVto fulfill their needs 
p5852
aVto produce children 
p5853
aVto raise them  domestic level of love affair people can have 
p5854
aVbut if people want to have a love affair which will bring them to an ultimate union 
p5855
aVthen not many people are competent to do that 
p5856
aVnot people  not many people are ready to have that kind of a love affair
p5857
aVwhere it ll make two lives into one 
p5858
aVtwo becomes actually one in experience
p5859
aVthat will need something more 
p5860
aVmost people are competent of using love to fulfill the domestic needs
p5861
aVbut to go beyond that they are not ready 
p5862
aVwhen i say they re not ready  either
p5863
aVi m not talking about this person or that person 
p5864
aVso when one is ready and another is not ready or
p5865
aVone is making an effort and another doesn t have the effort 
p5866
aVthen it feels like somebody is becoming a doormat 
p5867
aVthat is what it is that it feels like they re being exploited
p5868
aVbut above all  one who is longing to become  use love as a way of ultimate union
p5869
aVshould not be bothered about being doormat  this and that 
p5870
aVin india we have a culture
p5871
aVwhere by choice people name themselves as slaves 
p5872
aVyou know ramdas  krishnadas  this das  that das
p5873
aVwhat is this 
p5874
aVthey re openly saying  i m a slave 
p5875
aVi m a doormat 
p5876
aVi want to be a doormat 
p5877
aVthey are not saying   i m afraid i ll be used as a doormat 
p5878
aVthey re saying   i want to be doormat 
p5879
aVso  this is a kind of love that they re wanting to use to
p5880
aVuse for ultimate union 
p5881
aVthis is not for domestic purposes 
p5882
aVso  if you re looking for ultimate union then love is a different affair 
p5883
aVif you re looking for conducting of domestic affairs
p5884
aVthen you must manage dignity 
p5885
aVwho gets what 
p5886
aVif anybody is using more than what they should then
p5887
aVif you don t give me that i don t give you this  okay 
p5888
aVotherwise if you re looking for ultimate union
p5889
aVyou should not think of all these things  that s a different affair 
p5890
aVthat s not for normal social thing 
p5891
aVif you fall in love itself you become vulnerable to somebody 
p5892
ag4874
aV without becoming vulnerable there is no love affair 
p5893
ag4959
aVwhen you fall  somebody may raise you
p5894
aVor somebody may walk over you  
p5895
ag4874
aV but the thing is the
p5896
aVthe experience of your life is beautiful
p5897
aVbecause you fell not because they raised you 
p5898
aVnot because they walked over you 
p5899
aVbecause you could actually have the sense of abandon in you to fall 
p5900
aVthat was the beauty of your love affair
p5901
aVnot what they gave you  what they did to you  this   no 
p5902
aVthe beauty was you sat alone and you think you really loved this person
p5903
aVso much you re willing to die 
p5904
aVthat was the most beautiful moment  
p5905
aVnot the moment they gave you a big gift 
p5906
aVnot the moment they gave you a diamond ring 
p5907
aVnot the moment they said this and that about you   no 
p5908
aVyou just sat here and you re willing to die  that was the moment 
p5909
aVnot just a doormat 
p5910
aVyou re willing to be the dust on their feet  okay 
p5911
aVi m not saying you should be like that  
p5912
aVi m saying where love transformed itself into a devotion 
p5913
aVif you fall in love itself you become very vulnerable
p5914
aVbut there are still some shreds of sanity in love affairs that you can recover 
p5915
aVbut if you become a devotee there is no sanity left and you cannot recover 
p5916
aVso  before you tread such a land
p5917
aVyou must see whether you re for it or not 
p5918
aVwhat are your goals first of all 
p5919
aVif your goal is to make a life a cautioned 
p5920
aVa very measured love affair is good
p5921
aVbut you re  your  your thing is you want to dissolve into the process of life
p5922
aVyou don t want to have a good life 
p5923
aVyou re not planning to have a good life
p5924
aVyou just want to become explosion of life 
p5925
aVyou don t care what you get and what you don t get 
p5926
aVthen you become a devotee 
p5927
aVa devotion means it s your intention to dissolve into your object of devotion 
p5928
aVso a devotee is not expecting whether i ll become a doormat or a crown on somebody s head 
p5929
aVwhatever i become as long as i can touch your feet or head or whatever 
p5930
aVit s fine with me 
p5931
ag5617
aV so that s a different state of existence 
p5932
aVi don t think
p5933
aVsomebody who is looking for domestic level of love affair should even ask that question  
p5934
aV mmm  we have one question from the social media the facebook  
p5935
aVamitmadan wants to know
p5936
aVin this materialistic age the real feeling of love is disappearing from our life 
p5937
aVmost of the love we receive from others and express to others is superficial 
p5938
aVhow can we reinforce the real feeling of love in our own life and in others 
p5939
aV forget about others 
p5940
aVif you
p5941
aVif you learn to be loving by your own nature
p5942
aVnot because of somebody else or something else
p5943
aVi know the question is coming from facebook 
p5944
aVthere s an enormous possibility  
p5945
aVyou can even love those people who don t even exist  
p5946
aVso  i m saying it s a tremendous possibility
p5947
aVso 
p5948
aVif you just become love 
p5949
aVnot love somebody then you will know the nature of love 
p5950
aVif you love somebody it s a fickle happening
p5951
aVbecause no human being will happen hundred percent the way you want them 
p5952
aVevery human being on this planet is going to disappoint you  believe me 
p5953
aVnot because they ll do something wrong because nobody can fulfill the
p5954
aVunrealistic expectation you have of them 
p5955
aVit s simply not possible 
p5956
aVhave you been able to fulfill anybody s expectation i m asking you entirely 
p5957
aVpartially but never entirely  isn t it 
p5958
aVso nobody else will be able to do it
p5959
aVunless you re a still such a hopeless romantic
p5960
aVyou re still waiting that ideal person is going to come from somewhere  
p5961
ag5080
aVbelieve me whoever comes 
p5962
aVi want you to know the ideal people whom you worship 
p5963
aVwhen krishna was there his wives complained   all right 
p5964
aV so there is no hope for us 
p5965
ag4903
aVplease remember this   okay 
p5966
aVsadhguruji this is where we open yes the platform 
p5967
aVits  anybody has a question this is the moment 
p5968
aV my name is ananth 
p5969
aVmy question is about marriage 
p5970
aVdivorce 
p5971
aV no  no  they are two different things  
p5972
aV what i see today is many youngsters like many of them they don t want to marry
p5973
aVand few of them who marry
p5974
aVthere are occasions where they are getting divorced 
p5975
aVso would you like to throw some light on this situation sadhguru 
p5976
aV see  you need to understand the institution of marriage 
p5977
aVone thing is as we said a little while ago
p5978
aVit s about bringing a certain sanctity to the simple basic needs that every human being has 
p5979
aVi will repeat there are physical needs 
p5980
aVthere are psychological needs 
p5981
aVthere are economic needs 
p5982
aVemotional needs 
p5983
aVsocial needs 
p5984
aVvariety of needs 
p5985
aVto fulfill all these things we set up an institution called marriage
p5986
aVwhere all these can be conducted in a sensible manner 
p5987
aVotherwise if we did it on the streets like every other creature
p5988
aVit would turn ugly for us 
p5989
aVand we will feel not good about it 
p5990
aVso  to bring some sense of organization 
p5991
aVsome aesthetic 
p5992
aVsome stability 
p5993
aVbecause man and woman coming together naturally brought fresh life 
p5994
aVthe nature of human life 
p5995
aVthe nature of human offspring is such
p5996
aVthat because of the possibilities that a human being carries 
p5997
aVit is  compared to any other creature  it is the most helpless life
p5998
aVwhich needs maximum amount of support 
p5999
aVyou could leave a puppy on the street 
p6000
aVas long as he gets food  he grows up into a good dog 
p6001
aVno problem 
p6002
aVbut not so with a human being 
p6003
aVhe doesn t need just physical support 
p6004
aVhe needs variety of support and stab  above all the stable situation 
p6005
aVwhether there should be marriage in society or not
p6006
aVone will debate when they are eighteen because
p6007
aVphysical body is asking for freedom  all right 
p6008
aVat that time everybody questions  
p6009
aVis marriage really needed 
p6010
aVwhy can t we just live whichever way we want 
p6011
aVbut when you are three years of age you valued marriage immensely 
p6012
aVa stable marriage immensely 
p6013
ag4946
ag5715
ag5335
aV not yours 
p6014
aVyour parents 
p6015
aV the parents  yes  
p6016
aV when you were three  four of yours
p6017
aVthree  four years of age you re one hundred percent for marriage
p6018
aVagain when you become forty five  fifty again you re hundred percent for marriage
p6019
aVbetween and eighteen and thirty five you re questioning the whole process  
p6020
ag5692
aV that s true  
p6021
aV i m not saying marriage is the thing but do you have a better alternative 
p6022
aVif you have a better alternative 
p6023
aVdamn the marriage
p6024
aVbut you have not come up with a better alternative
p6025
aVbecause a stable situation is a must for a child 
p6026
aVonce you have a child it s a twenty year project   okay 
p6027
aVthat is if they do well 
p6028
aVif they don t do well it s a lifelong project  
p6029
aVso if you want to get into such projects
p6030
aVat least twenty years there must be a commitment to create a stable situation 
p6031
aVyour whims and fancies will change 
p6032
aVyour emotions will change 
p6033
aVif that is what it is  don t get into such situations 
p6034
aVit s not compulsory for everybody to get married 
p6035
aVit s good young pe  you were saying people are thinking whether to get married 
p6036
aVi m glad it is not necessary for everybody
p6037
aVbut if you get into it and if you  especially if you get into children
p6038
aVyou must understand  it s a minimum twenty year project
p6039
aVwhether you like it or you don t like it 
p6040
aVotherwise you shouldn t get into those projects 
p6041
aVyou don t walk into a project 
p6042
aVdrop it half way and walk away  isn t it 
p6043
aVthey have their benefits and they have their problems 
p6044
aVit s your choice but at least choose consciously 
p6045
aVyou don t have to get married because everybody is getting married 
p6046
aVyou don t have to talk about marriage and divorce in same breath
p6047
aVas if they come together  
p6048
aVthis is a completely an american idea 
p6049
aVyou re thinking of marriage and divorce together
p6050
aVnobody thought of divorce in this country till recently  isn t it 
p6051
aVwhy should you ever talk about marriage and divorce in one breath 
p6052
aVit s  it s a crime 
p6053
aVit s really a crime to think on those lines 
p6054
aVbut if it so happens
p6055
aVsomething truly went wrong between two people
p6056
aVand they have to separate that will any way inevitably happen 
p6057
aVyou don t have to plan it at the time of wedding  
p6058
aV namaskaram sadhguru 
p6059
aVnamaskaramjuhi mam 
p6060
aVyou mentioned about survival
p6061
aVand you talked about aesthetics of life 
p6062
aVi would like
p6063
aVi would request you to elaborate on aesthetics of life
p6064
aVand my second question is for my friend  
p6065
aVi don t know whether you will answer it or not
p6066
aVbut i just want to mention it over here
p6067
aVbecause she has requested me to do so 
p6068
aVher question is
p6069
aVwhat is the purpose of this universe 
p6070
aV oh  tell your friend i didn t make it  
p6071
aV thank you so much 
p6072
aV why am i being blamed for these things   i
p6073
aVthe only thing i have done is i ve figured the nature of my life
p6074
aVand by figuring the nature of this life
p6075
aVi know by inference
p6076
aVevery life has happened the same way 
p6077
aVnot just every life 
p6078
aVthe very cosmos has happened the same way 
p6079
aVif you know the nature of this life from its origin to its ultimate
p6080
aVyou know the nature of everything by inference 
p6081
aVeverything that s worth knowing 
p6082
aVso  tell your friend i didn t make this universe
p6083
aVso don t blame me for such big things 
p6084
aVi just figured my way through my life
p6085
aVand we should figure it
p6086
aVif you figure it you will see the most important thing that s happening in your life right now is
p6087
aVthat you re alive 
p6088
aVnothing else 
p6089
aVnot that stocks have gone up today that s not the most important thing 
p6090
aVnot your love affair 
p6091
aVnot this and that  
p6092
aVif you don t understand what i m saying
p6093
aVsuppose tomorrow you lost  i m not saying you must wish
p6094
aVi m not wishing you must loose
p6095
aVbut suppose tomorrow you lost half your money and you re feeling depressed
p6096
aVand your mind says i want to die 
p6097
aVclose your mouth  hold your nose like this  for two minutes 
p6098
aVyour body says to hell with your money  i want to live  
p6099
aVtomorrow you found your  love affair collapsed
p6100
ag6097
aVcheck   
p6101
aVthe life within you says to hell with your love affair  i want to live 
p6102
aVevery time you feel little suicidal or depressed
p6103
aVjust check  
p6104
aVthe life within you says to hell with all these things  i want to live 
p6105
aVso  i want to know the most important thing that s happening to you right now is life itself 
p6106
aVnot the fancy thoughts that you have 
p6107
aVnot the emotions that you have 
p6108
aVnot financial arrangements
p6109
aVor family arrangements
p6110
aVor whatever rubbish you have built around you
p6111
aVthese are all accessories to life 
p6112
aVthese are all frills 
p6113
aVfrills are so much you re missing the skirt 
p6114
aVthat s the whole problem with you  
p6115
ag4903
aVso much frill
p6116
aVfundamental things are forgotten  
p6117
aVso this is the most important thing 
p6118
aVright now for most people life means their job 
p6119
aVlife means the new house they re building 
p6120
aVlife means the car that they bought 
p6121
aVlife means their wife  their husband  their children  
p6122
ag5080
aVlife means what s throbbing here  
p6123
aVnot even your body 
p6124
aVnot your mind 
p6125
aVnot your thought 
p6126
aVnot your emotion 
p6127
aVwhat is right now throbbing here  this is life 
p6128
aVbecause this is on everything else seems to be meaningful 
p6129
aVif this one stops nothing around you means any damn thing to you or to anybody 
p6130
aa(lp6131
S'going everyone '
p6132

aS'we we to heal much you have to say'
p6189
aS'we moreentychilren'
p6190
aS'wolonoutbut'
p6191
aS'we ve not have been been educated in schools and'
p6192
aS'but i find our we have think'
p6193
aS'now of being they condition'
p6194
aS'like almost system in time'
p6195
aS'here is'
p6196
aS'so we widedanallbegin'
p6197
aS'i think you re looking for something unnatural that happened there '
p6198
aS'thinking that could be considered a natural was '
p6199
aS'it seems i was the ready delaework'
p6200
aS'my mother went to the husband three times and came back and she gave '
p6201
aS"to he's not coming "
p6202
aS'and a when it at all we happened it happened at all'
p6203
aS'my father being a physician that was not possible '
p6204
aS'had to be the hospital the i'
p6205
aS'i went and tatimsartdint happen'
p6206
aS'they did have it in possible and she gave up'
p6207
aS'so it happened at home to the '
p6208
aS'only reanablyunnatuilthing everything '
p6209
aS'a natural word i then '
p6210
aS'box'
p6211
aS'i i i i sure educated '
p6212
aS'upon but it'
p6213
aS'and the question that you askkingas'
p6214
aS'do people grow up and blotton'
p6215
aS'all of the brother by somebody you '
p6216
aS'see the gender epesioni '
p6217
aS'brought up in this place have a '
p6218
aS'in ductway'
p6219
aS'especially in the west i will see '
p6220
aS'out of christian '
p6221
aS'dish'
p6222
aS'very common words'
p6223
aS'i think it s absilutelythdipolusandhumiliating'
p6224
aS'that a human being has to be brought up'
p6225
aS'you bring up cattle okay'
p6226
aS'you don t bring up a human being'
p6227
aS'a human being is supposed to blossom by his own isha'
p6228
aS'that is why he s on the top of the pile'
p6229
aS'at least on this planet in their reducionaescale'
p6230
aS'and most human beings don t seem to understand that '
p6231
aS'or they are not allowed to understand that by a whole lot of people'
p6232
aS'and they need to be brought up'
p6233
aS'bringing up means somebody is molding you'
p6234
aS'molding mens its a pleaedtimin shape '
p6235
aS'and no flavor that blossoms is the same way as a '
p6236
aS'the one which blosamdestivy'
p6237
aS'but a more means is always going to be the same '
p6238
aS'no '
p6239
aS'the idea of making a mold is that we want to have the same form again'
p6240
aS'and again and again'
p6241
aS'right now genderly that seems to be the work'
p6242
aS'unfortunately after calentdeucationsistem'
p6243
aS'the so all religions that are operating in the world'
p6244
aS'and of course the family'
p6245
aS'they want you to be in a certain more'
p6246
aS'they do on you to bloom like a wild flower '
p6247
aS'rate of anything fresh happening among them '
p6248
aS'and something that tdisfamilia'
p6249
aS"they don't want something and familiar to be brown among them"
p6250
aS'so if you have ciccomdtothatsystem'
p6251
aS'then yes you be more into saidnpom'
p6252
aS'if you allow your humanity to blood'
p6253
aS"and see you don't belong to any more "
p6254
aS'is the beauty of being human that there is no a particular way to be'
p6255
aS'if you were a dog you would be one way '
p6256
aS'they would be on '
p6257
aS'if you re a sefouwouldbinodoaf '
p6258
aS'i would be another war grasp the rest opperrandotheway'
p6259
aS'but to be human means it is not particular way'
p6260
aS'what is human is not defined not described'
p6261
aS'it is it is just that'
p6262
aS'for every other creature on this planet'
p6263
aS'nattedrouttulis'
p6264
aS'within that they have to play that again'
p6265
aS'at a himanveing only the bottom line is drawn '
p6266
aS'or a line'
p6267
aS'but socially people are trying to draw a top line for themselves'
p6268
aS'but nature has not drawn a top line for you'
p6269
aS'elimitliss possibility '
p6270
aS'this is what is freaking human beings right now'
p6271
aS'because they can decide what they can can to be'
p6272
aS'they re trying to be like somebody else'

p6415
aS'low but be detached'
p6416
aS'what do you want to love then '
p6417
aS'only because you want to include somebody as a part of your life'
p6418
aS'part of yourself that s why you love'
p6419

p6420
aS'this means you are to come back to consultation every'

p6427
aS'a okay of coming back to contintecontheve'
p6428

p6429
aS'i i only say'
p6430
aS'so what is this need for love in a human being'
p6431
aS'he is understand'
p6432
aS'a human being constantly'
p6433
aS'constantly '
p6434
aS'a humoning is longing to be something on then what they are great now '
p6435
aS'if this finds a simple basic physical express'
p6436
aS'me on the sexuality'
p6437
aS'sesulelicyminsstust'
p6438
aS'physically you re trying to make something which is not you a part of yourself'
p6439
aS'but a pelmomentimensucceed'
p6440
aS'you should try this mentally it gets labeled as '
p6441
aS'conquest maybe simply shopping'
p6442
aS'shopping shopping '
p6443
aS'i '
p6444
aS'some people go for conquest with swords and guns '
p6445
aS'peopilogovetecbalecancapsoupcretitcarts'
p6446
aS'the thing is you want to include something which is not a part of you as yourself'
p6447
aS'that is a whole effort'
p6448
aS'whether you want money or well a you want to alcoubyannit'
p6449
aS'what is it'
p6450
aS'something that is not you you want to make it yours '
p6451
aS'yours is an effort to make it a part of yourself'
p6452
aS'if it happens emotionally on the emotional level so '
p6453
aS'we call this a love far'
p6454
aS'you re trying to make somebody who is not a part of you '
p6455
aS'or south emotionally '
p6456
aS'the law fat'
p6457
aS'if you do it consciously we can this yoga'
p6458
aS'to a man union'
p6459
aS'so all this efforts had fine '
p6460
aS'thing has its own beauty but has its own limitations'
p6461
aS'when you understand the limitations of all the other '
p6462
aS'nothing of it a wrong about it'
p6463
aS'it is just that it will work briefly'
p6464
aS'he will not work for always'
p6465
aS'when you realize that you consciously try to include'
p6466
aS'when you consciously become an inclusive process if you '
p6467
aS'if '
p6468
aS'experience everything as yourself then we say you are a yogi okay'
p6469
aS'so this is a low affair successful'
p6470
aS'so something you said at the end which '
p6471
aS'i would like to ask you again '
p6472
aS'and la inclusiveness'
p6473
aS'i can t understand how i can love everybody '
p6474
aS'you cannot'
p6475
aS'the suntictluconatl'
p6476
aS'i can be seen up there '
p6477
aS'so how is that had you incued everybody in your '
p6478
aS'as our looking at now as something that comes to'
p6479
aS'are you yet to the process of '
p6480
aS'only because you appreciate a particular quality'
p6481
aS'a shape of somebody s nose out of the shape of that '
p6482
aS'on the part of the emotion of the males '
p6483
aS'the milittal things had the valrelitty'
p6484
aS'something'
p6485
aS'okay the maniminitins'
p6486
aS'it is based on something that is acceptable to you '
p6487
aS'if they do something that is not acceptable to you'
p6488
aS'alocrumbles'

p6513
aS'we whoocitthetreeadadoghor a man had a woman or a child or just at the sky'
p6514

p6562
ag2415
aS'i know you re an actor but are you acting and a '

aS'so i held this because'
p6565
aS'we have done seven '
p6566
aS"and helties isn't it"
p6567
aS'oh we have not done it '
p6568

p6948
aS'so this concenteeonhisthendbut'
p6949
aS'now the thing that is happening is not the next'
p6950
aS'it is a serious influence because'
p6951
aS'in the last fifteen years the words have believed to communicate across colcis and borders'
p6952
aS'i saw heavy and so unprecedented'
p6953
aS'nobody has ever been used to this kind of inflencesitifareocan '

aS'it is not next'
p6960
aS'it is simply somewhere and nobody knows '

aS'is because it s too complex and too mixed'
p6962
aS'no body no here is inloringtheyoungpeople '
p6963
aS'just and make of things'
p6964
aS'so this is because of a sudden an lot of information and communication'
p6965
aS"we did not fullushojudgewethat it's good or we it is"
p6966
aS'that definitely this level of information'
p6967
aS'when i say information '
p6968
aS"it's like when we were growing up"

ag6402
aS'each '
p6983
aS'by the time they re eighteen they re had five laoffers and gone'
p6984
aS'in the western world like that here also it s beginning to happen '

p6988
aS'what next'
p6989
aS'when i go '
p6990
aS'you will see this is not my wish'
p6991
aS'but this is something that i see the way people s mind their work '
p6992
aS'the way they bin laden with information'
p6993
aS'i m not a by any stantersoffitimistec person'
p6994
aS'but i m us seeing this '
p6995
aS'if this level of information continues and ittlemunteplyndmanifol'
p6996
aS'or the coming denevations'
p6997
aS'you should not be sure'
p6998
aS'in the next fifty to hundred years'
p6999
aS'if fifty percent of the human population choose to come in to his '
p7000
aS'you should not be surprised'
p7001
aS'because that is what will happen to the mind'
p7002
aS'somebody s clapping look at this is popular '

V good morning sir 
p7559
aV namaskaram  
p7560
aV two things i ve never been in my life
p7561
aVare thin and nervous  
p7562
aVand i still haven t been able to get over the former
p7563
aVbut the latter is still very operational at this moment  
p7564
aVit s because i don t know what to say
p7565
aVbecause i feel i ve lived with you in this last week 
p7566
aVi ve done all my research 
p7567
aVwatched all your shows  from 
p7568
aV see  you have
p7569
aVyou have done your homework but
p7570
aVbecause i am homeless   i ve
p7571
aVi have not done my homework 
p7572
aV i have done a fair amount of my homework 
p7573
aVi have watched everyone from anupam kher to juhi chawla in conversation with you 
p7574
aVbarkha dutt  to a very subdued arnab goswami as well  
p7575
aVi do believe in your mystical power because you managed to achieve that
p7576
aVand i think that is not anything lesser of an achievement than you ve done 
p7577
aVwithin your span of tremendous work  sadhguru 
p7578
aVso my felicitations on that achievement  
p7579
aVand more than anything else 
p7580
aVwhen i just saw the av that all of us saw 
p7581
aVi ve heard all these terminologies associated with you 
p7582
aVwhich is from the monk on a motorcycle 
p7583
aVrockstar spiritual energy 
p7584
aVand i saw that happen 
p7585
aVyou re on a motorbike 
p7586
aVyou are flying a helicopter 
p7587
aVso there are so many terms that i said 
p7588
aVrockstar spiritual energy
p7589
aVand i want to create my own one say you re like almost the santa claus of spirituality  
p7590
aVbecause you bring the energy through that chimney of life
p7591
aVand i think have really touched so many millions of people across the world 
p7592
aVso we are blessed to be in your presence at this moment
p7593
aVand i can t wait to be in conversation  which is i am going to start 
p7594
aVbut i just want to start by saying that this is truly an honor 
p7595
aVso thank you  
p7596
aVi mean  as a filmmaker 
p7597
aVas a human being 
p7598
aVas a member of a humanitarian community 
p7599
aVmy head is always buzzing with so many questions
p7600
aVand i think we bottle it down to some spiritual inquiries 
p7601
aVsome religious ones 
p7602
aVthere s always been a debate about these two terms  
p7603
aVreligion and then spirituality 
p7604
aVthere are people who feel like 
p7605
aV i m not religious  i m spiritual 
p7606
aVand i m not quite sure they know the meaning of that 
p7607
aVbut they use it because sometimes terms are just thrown around 
p7608
aVto those people who are at the crossroad between religion and spirituality 
p7609
aVwhat is your answer to that dilemma 
p7610
aV see  we must understand this 
p7611
aVit is in the very nature of human intelligence
p7612
aVthat if you do not know something 
p7613
aVif you realize you do not know something  
p7614
aVbecause most people do not realize that they do not know   
p7615
aVif you realize that you do not know 
p7616
aVit s very natural for your intelligence to seek to know 
p7617
aVit doesn t need a guru 
p7618
aVit doesn t need a scripture 
p7619
aVit doesn t need somebody to introduce that to you 
p7620
aVit is in the nature of your intelligence that you wish to know 
p7621
aVthere re lots of experiments to show 
p7622
aVeven mice  if you leave them in a place 
p7623
aVwithin two minutes they will research everything in that space  
p7624
aVfor their own reasons of course 
p7625
aVfor survival reasons  they 
p7626
aVyou know  inquire into everything around them to find out how the place is 
p7627
aVhuman intelligence goes beyond survival 
p7628
aVso naturally  human intelligence seeks to know many more things 
p7629
aVwhich does not concern our survival 
p7630
aVyes  we are concerned about survival till a point 
p7631
aVbut once that s taken care of  we cannot rest 
p7632
aVwe want to know more  endlessly more 
p7633
aVthe more we realize we do not know 
p7634
aVthe more the longing to know 
p7635
aVso this longing to know 
p7636
aVwhen it finds a very intense expression in the form of seeking 
p7637
aVwe call this spiritual process 
p7638
aVor in other words 
p7639
aVthe basis of spirituality is a realization that   i do not know  
p7640
aVbut the moment you say   i m religious 
p7641
aVyou refer to yourself as a believer 
p7642
aVwhen you say you re a believer 
p7643
aVwhat you are saying is 
p7644
aV everything that i do not know  i will make it up 
p7645
aVhow i make it up 
p7646
aVwhose help i seek to make it up 
p7647
aVmay be varying from person to person 
p7648
aVsomebody makes it up because of  with spiritual assist
p7649
aVwith scriptural assistance 
p7650
aVsomebody makes it up with the assistance of a priest  or a pundit  or a guru  or whatever 
p7651
aVbut you seek some authority 
p7652
aVyou kind of make some compromise in your life 
p7653
aVthat instead of truth  you settle for an authority as the truth 
p7654
aVspiritual process means truth is the only authority for you 
p7655
aVauthority is never the truth for you 
p7656
aVso these are two different aspects 
p7657
aVunfortunately spoken in the same breath most of the time 
p7658
aVso  i would say spiritual process is far closer to scientific inquiry 
p7659
aVsee  even the fly is trying to investigate me  
p7660
aV trust me  i am not investigating  
p7661
aVi am just inquiring
p7662
aVand i wish i was the size of that fly but anyway
p7663
aV  no  no i did not
p7664
aVi did not use the word investigation in a negative way 
p7665
aVnothing wrong with investigation 
p7666
aVinvestigation means you want to know the truth 
p7667
aVmaybe it s done little forcefully like a fly  
p7668
aVhe s coming to you now  
p7669
aV that s all i get these days  
p7670
aV no  if you get to fly  what more  
p7671
aV well  you manage pretty well 
p7672
aVi have a fear of turbulence  
p7673
aVso flying is really not on my top three things to do in life 
p7674
aV so  spiritual process does not demand belief
p7675
aVbecause belief and spiritual process cannot go together 
p7676
aVspiritual process is a constant inquiry to
p7677
aVit is a way of sharpening your questions 
p7678
aVso they dig deeper and deeper  
p7679
aVnot into something else but into yourself 
p7680
aVthe nature of your existence 
p7681
aVbecause the nature of human existence is such that in our experience 
p7682
aVthe only thing that you can experience is yourself 
p7683
aVyou actually believe you re experiencing many things 
p7684
aVbut you only know everything the way it happens within you 
p7685
aVyou do not know any other way 
p7686
aVeven now if you see these people 
p7687
aVit looks like they are there 
p7688
aVbut actually you know them or you see them only the way they re projected in the firmament of our minds 
p7689
aVthere is no other way 
p7690
aVthere is no other way for you to experience this life  
p7691
aVexcept the way it happens within you 
p7692
aVnow spiritual process is a constant effort to see
p7693
aVthat the way that it happens within me
p7694
aVis not a distorted vision 
p7695
aVthat my mirror is not a wonky mirror 
p7696
aVit is a plain mirror  
p7697
aVthat it shows me things
p7698
aVthe way they  way things are 
p7699
aVit doesn t distort anything 
p7700
aVbecause of my thought 
p7701
aVbecause of my emotion 
p7702
aVbecause of my attachments 
p7703
aVbecause of my identities 
p7704
aVbecause of the philosophies and ideologies that i identify with 
p7705
aVi can distort my mirror 
p7706
aVnow  i deprive myself of all that 
p7707
aVso that i have a plain mirror
p7708
aVand i get to see everything just the way it is 
p7709
aVthis is spiritual process 
p7710
aV no  well  thank you because that s always been a continued dilemma 
p7711
aVand i believe that the word spirituality is sometimes misused 
p7712
aVwhere there is not a grave understanding of what it really is 
p7713
aVand as you said  that the  i don t know 
p7714
aVhas immense power and i think acknowledging the  i don t knows  of your life really means everything
p7715
aVand i wish people would start doing that
p7716
aVbecause according to me 
p7717
aVsometimes delusion is the biggest disease that plagues humanity  
p7718
aVwhen you re not aware of your own self 
p7719
aV no  there are  there are all kinds of idiots on the planet  
p7720
aV yeah  we work with many of them  
p7721
aV but we must understand this 
p7722
aVin the very nature of who we are  it is such  like this 
p7723
aVif you do something stupid today 
p7724
aVtonight your intelligence will bother you   why did i do this 
p7725
aVthis is the nature of human intelligence 
p7726
aVbut the moment your stupidity is either scripture endorsed or god endorsed 
p7727
aVyou can go on doing the same idiotic thing with enormous confidence 
p7728
aVit gives you confidence without clarity 
p7729
aVconfidence without clarity is a disastrous process 
p7730
aVif you do not have clarity 
p7731
aVat least you must have hesitation  
p7732
aV yes that s true  
p7733
aVwell  i have to say that i was  
p7734
aVi want to personalize this a little bit  
p7735
aVi was at a crossroad about thirteen years ago
p7736
aVand my father was very critically ill 
p7737
aVand at that juncture of my life and before that 
p7738
aVreligion was organized in my life 
p7739
aVit was what was taught to me 
p7740
aVit was what i thought the right thing to do was 
p7741
aVwhen he was in his last stage 
p7742
aVthere were things suggested to me 
p7743
aVwhich were to me now completely ridiculous 
p7744
aVincluding going to a certain temple and feeding a cow of a certain color
p7745
aVand doing a certain ritual at home
p7746
aVand all those things that one did even without even thinking 
p7747
aVbecause as you said  when you spoke about the idiots on this planet 
p7748
aVi was definitely one of those in that stage in my life 
p7749
aVbut sometimes you reach a critical stage 
p7750
aVwhere you seek any kind of desperate measure
p7751
aVand you try to kind of hold on to any hope 
p7752
aVthat even something that is advocated to you
p7753
aVthat goes against your grain of intelligence or thought 
p7754
aVto those people  what is your advice 
p7755
aVwho have reached the end of their rope
p7756
aVand are hanging on and holding on to anything 
p7757
aVbe it religious 
p7758
aVbe it spiritual  or be it
p7759
aVan unfounded piece of advice 
p7760
aV see  for all this 
p7761
aVthe fundamental basis of these kind of aspirations or actions
p7762
aVis because people are just shit scared of life 
p7763
aVwhy is it so 
p7764
aVit s like this 
p7765
aVsuppose you sat on a bicycle  on stand  you know 
p7766
aVand started simply pedaling for fun 
p7767
aVbut it came off the stand and started rolling  
p7768
aVanxiety 
p7769
aVfaster   fear 
p7770
aVvery fast   terror 
p7771
aVthe fundamental reason is
p7772
aVbut someone who knows how to ride a bicycle 
p7773
aVthe faster it goes  the better it is 
p7774
aVbut for someone who does not know how to ride a bicycle 
p7775
aVthe moment it moves  terror will happen 
p7776
aVso the fundamental thing is just this 
p7777
aVyou have been given a very complex and sophisticated vehicle
p7778
aVto pass through the process of this life 
p7779
aVwhich is human mechanism 
p7780
aVthere is body  mind  emotion  energy 
p7781
aVmany dimensions to it 
p7782
aVessentially  this human mechanism is a very complex phenomena 
p7783
aVnow you are going at it 
p7784
aVyou are trying to walk through life
p7785
aVwithout understanding a thing about the vehicle that you are using 
p7786
aVevery time it moves  there is terror 
p7787
aVif it doesn t move  you want to die of boredom 
p7788
aVif it moves  you re terrorized 
p7789
aVthere is no way out of it 
p7790
aVtell me one thing  tell me one thing that human beings are not suffering 
p7791
aVif they are poor  they suffer poverty 
p7792
aVif they become rich  they suffer taxes 
p7793
aVif they are not educated  they suffer that 
p7794
aVyou send them to school  endless suffering  
p7795
aVthey are not married  they suffer that 
p7796
aVyou get them married   
p7797
aV yeah  i was heading to that next 
p7798
aV i didn t say a thing  they are the ones 
p7799
aV well  that s an extreme validation of the institution  
p7800
aV so  tell me one thing that they re not suffering 
p7801
aVso now somebody develops a philosophy  
p7802
aVlife is suffering 
p7803
aVyou know  there are philosophies like this  
p7804
aVnow it s not about life
p7805
aVbecause you ve not even touched life yet 
p7806
aVall that you re dabbling with is right now
p7807
aVyour own thought and emotion and it s going crazy 
p7808
aVso  you are on a bicycle that you don t know how to ride 
p7809
aVbut this  is not just a simple two wheeled bicycle 
p7810
aVit s a complex machine 
p7811
aVyou don t know how to ride 
p7812
aVyou don t know how to manage your thought 
p7813
aVyou don t know how to manage your emotion 
p7814
aVall these things 
p7815
aVhuman experience is essentially happening from within you 
p7816
aVwhether it s misery or joy 
p7817
aVagony or ecstasy is happening from within you 
p7818
aVat least what happens from within you
p7819
aVmust happen your way  isn t it 
p7820
aVthe world will not happen your way 
p7821
aVbut the problem now is
p7822
aVwhat happens within you is not happening yeur  your way 
p7823
aVwhat s happening in your mind is a dream 
p7824
aVeven your dream is not happening your way 
p7825
aVthat s the problem  
p7826
aVthe problem is not that your life is not happening your way 
p7827
ag7825
aVand this is the source of their misery
p7828
aVbut they think it s marriage 
p7829
aVthey think it s children 
p7830
aVthey think it s poverty  
p7831
aVno 
p7832
aVfundamentally  it is just that you are not happening the way you want yourself to be 
p7833
aVthat s all your misery is 
p7834
aVso  even if you want to learn to ride a bicycle 
p7835
aVit s a simple basic machine 
p7836
aVit needs a certain level of attention and involvement 
p7837
aVotherwise you can t ride a bicycle 
p7838
aVtakes an enormous amount of intent to want to ride it 
p7839
aVotherwise it s quite impossible to ride a bicycle 
p7840
aVafter you know how to ride it  you can let your hands off 
p7841
aVyou can close your eyes and do all these things 
p7842
aV pretty much like marriage 
p7843
aVbecause like wheels are turning but going nowhere  
p7844
aVat times  
p7845
aV no  no  i wouldn t like to make that statement 
p7846
aVbecause for a many people they have gotten somewhere with marriage  
p7847
aV yes  we d like to find out where  
p7848
aVbut on another forum 
p7849
aVwhen you speak about suffering  sadhguru 
p7850
aVit is definitely something that i believe
p7851
aVthat self pity sometimes is like a luxury spa 
p7852
aVit s somewhere where your comfort lies 
p7853
aVself pity is i believe the most indulgent emotion
p7854
aVand gets you nowhere but makes you feel really good for a certain period of time 
p7855
aVwhat is your take on something like self pity 
p7856
aV how is being pitiful a luxury 
p7857
aVi don't understand that 
p7858
aV it becomes  you know
p7859
aVyou get great solace in that emotion  for a short period of time 
p7860
aVself pity can be the most happy place to be at 
p7861
aVlike self indulgences 
p7862
aV see  there are many ways to achieve piece 
p7863
aVhappiness  well being  tch 
p7864
aVthis happened 
p7865
aVshankaran pillai  
p7866
aVin his
p7867
aVhe was a little abusive husband 
p7868
aVverbally abusive 
p7869
aVso he would rant at his wife but she was always peaceful 
p7870
aVnever reacted 
p7871
aVone day in the middle of his raging rant 
p7872
aVhe stopped and he asked 
p7873
aV whatever i say  how much ever i abuse you  you are peaceful 
p7874
aVhow do you do this 
p7875
aVshe said   i clean the toilet 
p7876
aVhe said   what  cleaning the toilet 
p7877
aVhow does it make you peaceful 
p7878
aVshe said   i use your toothbrush   
p7879
aVso  don t fall on to that
p7880
aV you are giving lots of people ideas  
p7881
aVso that s not a relationship 
p7882
aVit s a revenge story  
p7883
aV no  you can achieve peace and solace in so many different ways 
p7884
aVi am saying  
p7885
aV which is what you said 
p7886
aVto draw from within to find your solutions 
p7887
aVbecause the most exciting line that i read was
p7888
aVthat life can t touch you  can t scratch you 
p7889
aVit can t harm you 
p7890
aVyou create your own energy in your own life 
p7891
aVyou re in this universe  you ve been brought into this world
p7892
aVand it s in your control  what you do with it 
p7893
aVlife has nothing against you  what you achieve
p7894
aVand what you do is a result of your own actions 
p7895
aVyour feelings  the pleasantness that you create within yourself 
p7896
aVwhich to me was a very moving line
p7897
aVbecause it simplified a very extensive and expansive feeling of anxiety  fear
p7898
aVand all the turbulence that humanity goes through on a daily basis 
p7899
aVto me  three pillars of our existence are pretty much
p7900
aVfamily  fortune and farishta 
p7901
aVwhich is what i believe result of god  religion  everything else 
p7902
aVwhen we talk about family  sadhguru 
p7903
aVthere are few things that have always intrigued me
p7904
aVand i seek answers
p7905
aVor rather validation from a higher energy such as yourself 
p7906
aVit s like i ve always questioned why there s an organic distance
p7907
aVbetween a father and son 
p7908
aVwhy there is always that angst in that relationship 
p7909
aVand i am sure there are many in this house
p7910
aVthat have experienced that emotion in their own homes 
p7911
aVin their own environment 
p7912
aVwhere do you think the origin of that distance came 
p7913
aV because every generation makes the same mistake  
p7914
aVwhich means they re not learning at all  
p7915
aVwhen we say family
p7916
aVyou know  in italy 
p7917
aVfamily meant crime 
p7918
aV crime 
p7919
aV yeah 
p7920
aVmafia was always referred to as the family 
p7921
aV family 
p7922
aV yes  so in a way  it s a kind of crime 
p7923
aVit is the most basic institution in the making of a society 
p7924
aVbut it does not mean you must remain basic 
p7925
aVbecause this is a biological identity that we have 
p7926
aVbiology is a reality  we can t deny it 
p7927
aVobviously this  was
p7928
aVin some way  at least to a certain extent 
p7929
aVour parents gave this  to us 
p7930
aVone part of it at least 
p7931
aVtoday the way it is 
p7932
aVthe way it looks is essentially because of them 
p7933
aVwell  it was given to them by somebody else 
p7934
aVthat s another point 
p7935
aVbut to us  it was given by them 
p7936
aVso it s a biological identity 
p7937
aVthis limiting oneself to one s biological idetity
p7938
aVidentity for an entire lifetime
p7939
aVis  is a crime
p7940
aVbecause it creates so many things 
p7941
aVin this country
p7942
aVthis country has suffered a lot from a long time 
p7943
aVjust now you released the mahabharat video 
p7944
aVentire mahabharat is family problem 
p7945
aVit is dhritarashtra syndrome 
p7946
aVwe are still suffering  
p7947
aV my son is best  no matter what 
p7948
aVeven today we are suffering the same thing 
p7949
aV my son is best and he should become the king 
p7950
aVno matter what 
p7951
aVit s not just 
p7952
aV some sons haven t managed very well  some have  
p7953
aV so  family is a basic identity that we are born with 
p7954
aVit s a wonderful thing when you are a child
p7955
aVbecause without that family support 
p7956
aVyou wouldn t be who you are today in many ways  okay 
p7957
aVwith all due respect and regard and great respect
p7958
aVfor the family because
p7959
aVhuman creature is born in such a way
p7960
aVthat as soon as you fall out of your mother s womb 
p7961
aVyou are not ready get up on your feet and do things like other creatures 
p7962
aVit needs a long gestation period before
p7963
aVa man becomes a man or a woman becomes a woman 
p7964
aVthere is a long period 
p7965
aVwhere the incubation of family is most important and vital 
p7966
aVthere s no question about that 
p7967
aVbut you re supposed to grow beyond that identity 
p7968
aVbut a whole lot of people just never grow beyond that identity 
p7969
aVfor which they suffer
p7970
aVand sometimes if they re born in certain places 
p7971
aVthey make the entire nation suffer  
p7972
aVyou are supposed to grow out of that 
p7973
aVas a child  it s most vital that you are identified with the family 
p7974
aVbut as an adult 
p7975
aVyou re supposed to grow beyond your biology
p7976
aVbecause biology is the most basic identity 
p7977
aVone has to grow beyond that 
p7978
aVso having said that 
p7979
aVis it necessary that every father and every son has to have some kind of angst 
p7980
aVit is not about father and son 
p7981
aVit is just two men being accommodated in the same home  
p7982
aVwhen you were eight  ten  your father was godlike 
p7983
aVso this problem started after you became fifteen  sixteen 
p7984
aVwhen you want to be a man and there s not enough space 
p7985
aVthis big man is occupying too much space 
p7986
aVand that man thinks 
p7987
aV this is my space and who is this   
p7988
aVthey can t recognize each other as father and son because
p7989
aVnow there are
p7990
aVthere is no father and son 
p7991
aVthere are two men in the same house
p7992
aVand there s not enough space 
p7993
aVthis happens not in just human families 
p7994
aVevery creature 
p7995
aVwhether it s an elephant  or a buffalo  or whatever 
p7996
aVin every creature s life 
p7997
aVthis happens that
p7998
aVthere ll be some friction
p7999
aVand either the younger one goes out or the older one goes out 
p8000
aVthis happens everywhere
p8001
aVbecause this is not a problem between father and son 
p8002
aVthis is two men trying to share the same space
p8003
aVand the same woman called mother to one and wife to the other   
p8004
aV two men 
p8005
aVwell  that certainly breaks a strong myth
p8006
aVthat this country has operated with
p8007
aVbecause the problem was always meant to be two women  in the same house
p8008
aVand you just changed it on its head  which i believe is true 
p8009
aVbecause i believe the problem lies in the fact that two men can t be accommodated 
p8010
aV no  it also happens between women in a different way 
p8011
aVbut women have a way of covering their frictions in certain way 
p8012
aVthey do it in a certain way  in a feminine way 
p8013
aVmen will do it in more  
p8014
aVhead to  head on 
p8015
aVhead butting is the man s way 
p8016
aVwoman s way is different 
p8017
aVshe will do it differently  but the friction happens 
p8018
aV and i feel it s always like the mother energy of the house
p8019
aVthat sometimes has to bear the brunt of this tussle in a family 
p8020
aVit s also the other thing that
p8021
aVan offshoot of that thought is that i believe very strongly
p8022
aVthat the people you love the most 
p8023
aVyou kind of tend to dump all your anxieties  your angers 
p8024
aVyour fears  your insecurities 
p8025
aVall onto that one source
p8026
aVthat gives you the maximum love and the one that you love the most 
p8027
aVwhy is it that we as a human race tend to do that 
p8028
aVtend to lumber all our negative emotions on our most positive light source 
p8029
aV no  no  because if you try to dump it on someone on the street 
p8030
aVthey ll smash you up  
p8031
aV so
p8032
aV you are choosing a  a safe place 
p8033
aV but is that always fair 
p8034
aV first of all 
p8035
aVit s not fair for you to carry anxieties and angsts and angers and problems within you
p8036
aVbecause
p8037
aVsee  if i try to torture you 
p8038
aVyou have some defense against me 
p8039
aVeither you will fight me  or you will run away 
p8040
aVor you ll do something 
p8041
aVyou have some kind of defense 
p8042
aVbut if you start torturing yourself 
p8043
aVthis  is the most helpless creature 
p8044
aVno
p8045
aVmost defenseless 
p8046
aVi m telling you  even an unborn child  if you poke like this  
p8047
aVhe responds 
p8048
aVhe defends himself in his own little way  okay 
p8049
aVbut this one  is completely defenseless 
p8050
aVwhen you start poking yourself 
p8051
aVthis  is a completely defenseless life 
p8052
aVso the worst kind of torture 
p8053
aVthe lowest level of mind is one who tortures himself 
p8054
aVbut they always think
p8055
aVthey are the highest level of people 
p8056
aV i suffer for everybody   
p8057
aVyou bloody suffer anyway  
p8058
aVif there is everybody  you will dump it on them 
p8059
aVotherwise you ll simply suffer  
p8060
aVpeople come to me and say 
p8061
aV sadhguru   i can t bear with my 
p8062
aVyou know  my mother in law  she is impossible  
p8063
aVmy husband  after all  her son 
p8064
aVmy wife  oh   she is terror for me 
p8065
aVmy boss  he is not even human   
p8066
aVlike this  it goes on 
p8067
aVi tell them   you come  don t worry  i ll give you a nice place to stay 
p8068
aVi ll give you good food 
p8069
aVnothing to do 
p8070
aVfor your life  i ll take care of you 
p8071
aVonly thing is  i will make some random checks on you 
p8072
aVwhen i check  you must be joyful 
p8073
aVif you re miserable 
p8074
aVi don t believe in feeding misery   
p8075
aVso  you leave them in one place for twenty four hours 
p8076
aVyou will see how they will mess themselves up 
p8077
aVso when you re alone 
p8078
aVif you re miserable  you are obviously in bad company  
p8079
aVnow you are thinking 
p8080
aV because of this person  i am suffering 
p8081
aVbecause of that person  i am suffering 
p8082
aVjust stay alone by yourself 
p8083
aVwithout any entertainment 
p8084
aVwithout texting 
p8085
aVwithout television 
p8086
aVwithout reading 
p8087
aVsimply sit in one place
p8088
aVjoyfully  let me see 
p8089
aVmost people can t stay there for five minutes  believe me 
p8090
aVthey are not on facebook 
p8091
aVthey are not on twitter 
p8092
aVthey re not this thing
p8093
aVbecause they have something to say or because they have fallen in love with the world  
p8094
ag7832
aVif they stay alone  they ll go crazy  that s a fact 
p8095
aV what is  i mean  sorry to break that train of thought 
p8096
aVbut what is the solution to that kind of feeling
p8097
aVof just not enjoying your own space 
p8098
aV because we have not looked at how human mechanism works 
p8099
aVit is like you have a super sophisticated machine
p8100
aVthis  the super super computer out of
p8101
aVthis  is the machine  which dripped super computers  isn t it 
p8102
aVi am asking  have you read the user s manual  
p8103
aVthat s all it is 
p8104
aVthe entire yogic system is just this 
p8105
aVthis is not a philosophy 
p8106
aVthis is not an ideology 
p8107
aVthis is not a religion 
p8108
aVthis is not a teaching 
p8109
aVthis is just the user s manual 
p8110
aVhow to
p8111
aVhow your body should sit 
p8112
aVhow it must breathe 
p8113
aVhow the mind should be 
p8114
aVhow the emotions should be 
p8115
aVhow the energy should be 
p8116
aVwhat are the things you can do with it 
p8117
aVhow should you keep it so that this 
p8118
aVwill function at its highest possible level 
p8119
aVsee  the cellphone companies have been doing some research a few years ago
p8120
aVand they found
p8121
aVonly seven percent
p8122
aVor only three percent of the people
p8123
ag7832
aVninety seven percent of the people are using only seven percent of the cellphone s capability 
p8124
aVwe are not even talking about today s smartphones 
p8125
aVwe re talking about the dumb phones 
p8126
aVso ninety seven percent of the people are using only seven percent of a small gadget 
p8127
aVif that is the fact 
p8128
aVhow much do you believe are people making use of this tremendous gadget  
p8129
aVjust on the surface because they are never bothered to read the user s manual 
p8130
aVif you tell them this  they say 
p8131
aV sadhguru  can you give us the user s manual 
p8132
aVit s written into you 
p8133
aVyou have to spend some time with this   
p8134
aVthis was written by the source of creation 
p8135
aVnot by me or you  isn t it 
p8136
aVyou must learn to read 
p8137
aVthe problem is illiteracy 
p8138
aVsee  suppose you are  you do not  you have not learnt the alphabet 
p8139
aVwell  you have learnt english alphabet 
p8140
aVlet s say i ll give you a tamil book 
p8141
aVyou look at it  does it make any sense to you 
p8142
aVyou don t know the alphabet  it doesn t make a  doesn t mean a thing to you
p8143
aVbecause you do not know the alphabet 
p8144
aVnow  this is the problem  that in today s society 
p8145
aVin modern education 
p8146
aVwe have not even brought fundamental literacy
p8147
aVtowards how to read this book  
p8148
aVbecause we ve never read this  
p8149
aVby accident we are managing it 
p8150
aVif you manage by accident  sometimes it works 
p8151
aVsometimes it doesn t work 
p8152
aVone moment you are happy 
p8153
aVnext moment you are miserable 
p8154
aVone moment you are peaceful 
p8155
aVanother moments you are in turmoil 
p8156
aVi was    you know 
p8157
aVi ll cut the long story short  
p8158
aVi was in tel aviv and somebody came and greeted me 
p8159
aV shalom 
p8160
aVi said   what does that mean 
p8161
aVhe said   this is the highest way of greeting 
p8162
aVi said   that s your opinion but what does it mean 
p8163
aVhe said   no  no  no  this is really the highest way of greeting 
p8164
aVi said   all right but what does the word mean 
p8165
aVhe said   it means peace 
p8166
aVthen i say 
p8167
aV why is peace the highest way of greeting unless you are born in middle east   
p8168
aVin south india 
p8169
aVyou come up to me in the morning and say   peace 
p8170
aVi will ask   what s wrong with you   
p8171
aVi am saying if you deprive yourself of something for a long time 
p8172
aVsuddenly it becomes godlike 
p8173
aVif you have not eaten for ten days 
p8174
aVeven if god appeared 
p8175
aVwhat s the prayer  
p8176
aVfood  of course 
p8177
aVso 
p8178
aVonce you deprive yourself of fundamental things
p8179
aVi am saying fundamental things because
p8180
aVto be peaceful and joyful is not the ultimate goal of life 
p8181
aVif you want to enjoy your meal  you must be peaceful and joyful 
p8182
aVif you want to enjoy your friend  you must be peaceful and joyful 
p8183
aVif you want to enjoy your walk on the street  you must be peaceful and joyful 
p8184
aVif you want to enjoy simple things that you do in your life 
p8185
aVyou must be at least peaceful and joyful  if not ecstatic 
p8186
aVso it is a most fundamental requirement 
p8187
aVthis is not happening 
p8188
aVpeople are saying this is the ultimate goal of life 
p8189
aVeven so called spiritual leaders are saying 
p8190
aV peace is the ultimate goal of life 
p8191
aVsuch people will only rest in peace  
p8192
aV in what i believe surrounds us all is urban angst  
p8193
aVi think that seems to be terminology that comes out of mental health solutions  et cetera 
p8194
aVand that seems to be rampant in many parts of the world now 
p8195
aVincluding now slowly penetrating even in india 
p8196
aVwhen people deal with mental health issues
p8197
aVlike depression and anxiety 
p8198
aVand those  seek certain chemical imbalance issues that are told to them about
p8199
aV hey  they re making you look very pretty on the screen 
p8200
aVhow do they do that 
p8201
aVthey re not doing it to me  
p8202
aV they are making my what  my  
p8203
aV look at yourself there 
p8204
aV am i looking pretty on screen 
p8205
aV yeah  yeah  see 
p8206
aV okay  
p8207
aV they re not doing that to me  
p8208
aV you are actually looking stunning to me  sir  
p8209
aV stunning is another word for shocking  
p8210
aV well  i was trying to find another adjective to counter that  
p8211
aVbut back to me and my mental health issue  
p8212
aVi really want to know 
p8213
aVit s such an order of the day today 
p8214
aVeveryone seems to kind  it s almost
p8215
aVand i hate to say this with any
p8216
aVand i don t say this with any kind of disrespect to people s personal circumstance 
p8217
aVbut i almost feel like today it s talked about
p8218
aVlike it s almost a fashionable issue 
p8219
aVwhere i think it s a very serious issue 
p8220
aVwhen people talk about mental health issues
p8221
aVlike depression and anxiety
p8222
aVand seek counseling to sort those issues out 
p8223
aVand then the diagnosis at times is chemical imbalance
p8224
aVand medication is given 
p8225
aVwhat
p8226
aVand then your
p8227
aVwell  i know you hate the word philosophy 
p8228
aVbut all your teachings are definitely about finding yourself
p8229
aVand seeking that pleasantness from within 
p8230
aVbut to those who are not strong enough to achieve that and seek this assistance 
p8231
aVwhat is your take on that 
p8232
aV let me correct one more thing in the question 
p8233
aVthis is
p8234
ag8109
aVthis is just a technology 
p8235
aVi am just giving people simple methods
p8236
aVwith which they can work 
p8237
aVif people are coming for a teaching 
p8238
aVthey re frustrated with me
p8239
aVbecause every time they come  they leave more confused than ever before  
p8240
aVif they look
p8241
aVif they are more confused  in a way my job is done
p8242
aVbecause 
p8243
aVmy entire work is to get them out of silly conclusions 
p8244
aVthat they have made about life 
p8245
aVand confusion means you are still looking 
p8246
aVyou have an active intelligence 
p8247
aVconclusions means
p8248
aVwhat is the conclusion of your life 
p8249
aVhello 
p8250
ag8249
aVyou don t know 
p8251
aVlet me reveal the suspense to you 
p8252
aVthough as a filmmaker he won t tell you till the end  
p8253
aVi will reveal it to you
p8254
aV sometimes we don t even know what happens after that so  
p8255
aVmany of us are confused souls when we make movies 
p8256
aV so  the conclusion of your life is you ll be dead  
p8257
aVyou think something else is going to happen to you  
p8258
aVyou ll be just dead  that s all is the conclusion 
p8259
aVso every time you make a conclusion 
p8260
aVin some way you die  you need to understand this 
p8261
aVyou kill something of yourself every time you make a conclusion 
p8262
aVthis is you in a state of committing suicide in installments 
p8263
aVyou may call this religion 
p8264
aVyou may call this philosophy 
p8265
aVyou may call this being socially whatever 
p8266
aVbut fundamentally you re committing suicide in installments 
p8267
aVthis is why
p8268
aVwhen you look at a child and yourself 
p8269
aVyou are less alive than a child 
p8270
aVas you grow up  should you become more alive or less alive 
p8271
aVunfortunately  most adults are less alive than children  isn t it 
p8272
aVyou must be more alive
p8273
aVbut unfortunately you re less alive 
p8274
aVmaybe your physical agility will go down with age
p8275
aVbut your aliveness need not go down 
p8276
aValiveness is going down because
p8277
aVyou re continuously making conclusions and conclusions and conclusions 
p8278
aVas you conclude  you become less and less alive 
p8279
aVyou know that there is that famous parable 
p8280
aVwhich is all over the place 
p8281
aVabout adam and eve 
p8282
aVit seems god told them
p8283
aVit s a dumb couple 
p8284
aV kind of  
p8285
aVlook at what we had to suffer as a result of them  
p8286
aV no  no  not because of that 
p8287
aVbecause they didn t know what to do with each other  
p8288
aVso  god told them 
p8289
aV you eat whatever you want  but don t eat from this particular tree 
p8290
aVyou know what tree that was 
p8291
aV apple 
p8292
aV no  apple means in old english just a fruit 
p8293
aV knowledge 
p8294
aV what  knowledge 
p8295
aVyour parents tell you  you must eat the fruit of knowledge 
p8296
aVyour teachers insist that you must eat the fruit of knowledge 
p8297
aVeverybody in the society
p8298
aValways trying to shove knowledge down your throat 
p8299
aVbut in  it seems god told you not to eat the fruit of knowledge
p8300
aVand by eating that 
p8301
aVthat adam and eve fell 
p8302
aVit is not about that adam and that eve 
p8303
aVit s about every adam and every eve 
p8304
aVthe moment you eat the fruit of knowledge  you fall
p8305
aVbecause your idea of a knowledge is
p8306
aVthe conclusions that you make about everything in the universe  
p8307
aVso this mental illness which is becoming pandemic
p8308
aVthey are telling me  
p8309
aVi don't know how far these statistics are right  
p8310
aVthey are telling me
p8311
aVover forty people  particularly women in america 
p8312
aVover forty years of age 
p8313
aVnearly fifty two percent of them are on some kind of antidepressants 
p8314
aVfifty two percent is not a joke 
p8315
aVfifty two percent is not a joke  
p8316
aVit means entire humanity is becoming sick 
p8317
aVwe must look at it  why 
p8318
aVfundamentally 
p8319
aVbecause you are banking on a few things for a long time
p8320
aVfor your mental stability and emotional stability 
p8321
aVall these things are taken away 
p8322
aVone thing is  as you mentioned
p8323
aVthe crime that we call as family 
p8324
aVit gave us the support 
p8325
aVno matter what happened  there was somebody always for you 
p8326
aVothers are with you when you do the right things 
p8327
aVif you do the wrong thing  they ll distance themselves 
p8328
aVthere was one bunch of people 
p8329
aVwho was like a  for the circus that you do 
p8330
aVthey were the net 
p8331
aVwhichever way you fall 
p8332
aVthere s somebody to hold you for some moments 
p8333
aVbut that net is gone 
p8334
aVnow when you fall  you fall 
p8335
aVbecause of that  people are cracking up 
p8336
aVso if you want to remove
p8337
aVsee  in this culture 
p8338
aVthere was a time in the tradition 
p8339
aVwhere thirty percent of india s population were monks 
p8340
aVthat means consciously they went beyond family 
p8341
aVconsciously they chose to live without family 
p8342
aVto live without support 
p8343
aVto live without a home 
p8344
aVhomelessness not out of deprivation but by choice 
p8345
aVnobody ever had a depression 
p8346
aVbecause they transcended the need for the net 
p8347
aVyou learnt your trapeze bar act really well 
p8348
aVnow you can do it without the net 
p8349
aVyou are not good at it  you better have a net  isn t it  
p8350
aVotherwise your head will crack 
p8351
aVright now  that s all that s happening 
p8352
aVthe traditional support system that we had 
p8353
aVwe re taking it off 
p8354
aVwhen we talked about religion 
p8355
aVwith all due respect  we must acknowledge this 
p8356
aVtoday people are trying to go to psychiatrists 
p8357
aVindia doesn t have enough psychiatrists for one billion people  believe me 
p8358
aVno country has  and above all  they re very inefficient
p8359
aVbecause they can take only one client at a time
p8360
aVand they need lot of furniture like this  
p8361
aVit s very inefficient 
p8362
aVreligion handled human psychological balance effortlessly 
p8363
aV god is with you  don t worry 
p8364
aVit settled a whole lot of people 
p8365
aVdo not underestimate the value of that 
p8366
aVit is very inexpensive mass psychiatry 
p8367
aVwhere people 
p8368
aVno people
p8369
aVno  no  i m not
p8370
aVthis is not a joke 
p8371
aVwhen you are mentally ill  it s not a joke 
p8372
aVit s a most painful thing 
p8373
aVif you get physical ailments  you will get everybody s compassion 
p8374
aVwhen you get mental ailment  you ll get laughter  you know  unfortunately 
p8375
aVbecause you don t know when somebody is sick
p8376
aVand when somebody is being stupid  tch 
p8377
aVyou can t make out 
p8378
aVthis is the biggest problem
p8379
aVfor those families  who have somebody in the family  who is mentally disturbed 
p8380
aVyou don t know when they are making it up 
p8381
aVwhen they are really suffering 
p8382
ag8378
aVthere is no perfect way 
p8383
aVthere is no science anywhere to tell you exactly when
p8384
aVbecause human beings can make up every kind of thing 
p8385
aVyou are an actor  you know 
p8386
aVi don't know  you  you are actor or 
p8387
aV i do most things  yeah 
p8388
ag8207
aV we act even in our day to day existence  all of us do  
p8389
aV no  that is fine  but are you actor  just director 
p8390
aV no  no  i tried  i failed  
p8391
aV okay  so  all right  you are a bad actor  
p8392
ag7920
aVbut i am an actor nonetheless 
p8393
aV but at least you make other people act 
p8394
aV yes 
p8395
aV so  you know  in a cinema or drama  you can act something
p8396
aVand make it really real to a point 
p8397
aVwhere these 10000 people will sit and experience like it s real 
p8398
aVso  when a mentally ill person is in your home 
p8399
aVyou don t know whether he s acting it up or it s real 
p8400
aVsometimes it s real 
p8401
aVsometimes he s playing with it 
p8402
ag8378
aVyou don t know when to be compassionate 
p8403
aVwhen to be hard on him 
p8404
aVthis is the biggest problem for people  who have mentally ill
p8405
aVpeople in  within their homes 
p8406
aVthis is the huge problem
p8407
aVbecause there is no perfect way of making a judgment 
p8408
aVand it is not joke 
p8409
aVsee  human sanity is a very fragile thing 
p8410
aVthe line between sanity and insanity is so thin 
p8411
aVif you push it every day  you will cross it 
p8412
aVsee  when you get angry  what do you say 
p8413
aVwhat s the expression 
p8414
aV i am mad with you  or  i am mad right now 
p8415
aVso you are enjoying that little bit of madness 
p8416
aVyou crossed the line and it felt like
p8417
aVit s some kind of a freedom and power 
p8418
aVbut one day when you cannot cross back 
p8419
aVthat is when suffering begins 
p8420
aVand suffering means 
p8421
aVit s not like physical pain 
p8422
aVit s immense suffering 
p8423
aVi have been around people who have been mentally ill 
p8424
aVtrying to help them 
p8425
aVit is
p8426
aVnobody should have it 
p8427
aVbut unfortunately  it s becoming an epidemic in the world 
p8428
aVthat mental illnesses are growing like never before
p8429
aVbecause all the supports they had we are pulling it out
p8430
aVwithout replacing it 
p8431
aVif people become so conscious and so capable within themselves 
p8432
aVyou pull all the supports  everything will be fine 
p8433
aVbut without giving that competence 
p8434
aVyou just pull the supports 
p8435
aVpeople will crack 
p8436
aVin the western societies  it s happening large scale 
p8437
aVwe are not going to be far behind 
p8438
aVespecially the urban societies in india will move in this direction
p8439
aVbecause once again in many ways 
p8440
aVurban india is more west than west 
p8441
aVthere are more people in denims here than in america  
p8442
aV well  no  thank you  thank you for that
p8443
aVbecause i know it is definitely a crisis that plagues us
p8444
aVand some  as i said  seek help 
p8445
aVsome who are helped 
p8446
aVi am happy for them and i am sure grateful for resources that are available 
p8447
aVand those that find pleasantness within themselves 
p8448
aVi think that truly is a glorious solution to their issues
p8449
aV see  when we say pleasantness 
p8450
aVhuman pleasantness can be looked at in many different ways 
p8451
aVone simple way of looking at it  
p8452
aVbecause medical science is looking at it that way 
p8453
aVi don t see it that way 
p8454
aVbut that s a consequence for me
p8455
aV  is every human experience has a chemical basis to it 
p8456
aVwhat you call as peace  joy  love  turmoil  tranquility  agony  ecstasy 
p8457
aVeverything has a chemical balance  chemical basis to it 
p8458
aVeven health and ill health has a chemical basis to it 
p8459
aVtoday entire pharmacology is just about
p8460
aVtrying to manage your health by using chemicals 
p8461
aVit s a  today or  a doctor s or a physician s job is 
p8462
aVit s an orchestra of chemistry that he s trying to manage 
p8463
aVput this pill  something more happened 
p8464
aVput that pill 
p8465
aVthen something less happened  then do this  do that  
p8466
aVtrying to manage the orchestra of chemistry because
p8467
aVthis  is the most complex chemical factory on the planet 
p8468
aVthis  is a very complex chemical factory 
p8469
aVmanaging it from outside is  very  very difficult 
p8470
aVbut you could manage it from inside 
p8471
aVbut you must have access to your insides
p8472
aVif your innards are not available to you 
p8473
aVthen how do you manage it from inside 
p8474
aVyou only try to manage it from outside 
p8475
aVall  even mental illness is a largely being managed by chemical input 
p8476
aVbut all the chemicals that you can think of on this planet
p8477
aVare in some way already present in this  
p8478
aVwhether you are seeking medically prescribed drugs
p8479
aVor you re going for the backstreet drugs 
p8480
aVwhatever you are going 
p8481
aVessentially you are trying to bring pleasantness within yourself
p8482
aVbecause health means one level of pleasantness 
p8483
aVif  if body becomes pleasant  we call this health 
p8484
aVif it becomes very pleasant  we call this pleasure 
p8485
aVif your mind becomes pleasant  we call this peace 
p8486
aVif it becomes very pleasant  we call this joy 
p8487
aVif your emotions become pleasant  you call this love 
p8488
aVif it becomes very pleasant  we call it compassion 
p8489
aVif your very energies become pleasant  we call this bliss 
p8490
aVif it becomes very pleasant  we call it ecstasy 
p8491
aVif your surroundings become pleasant  we call this success  
p8492
aVso  we are trying to manage pleasantness by putting chemicals 
p8493
aVto what extent means  
p8494
aVthese statistics are out now  
p8495
aVin united states 
p8496
aVthey are saying seventy percent of the population
p8497
aVis on some kind of prescription medication 
p8498
aVthe  most affluent country  where there is enormous choice of nourishment
p8499
aVand lifestyles 
p8500
aVhere seventy percent are on prescription medication 
p8501
aVso you are trying to manage your sanity and your health
p8502
aVby putting chemicals from outside 
p8503
aVbut there is no doubt in anybody s mind today
p8504
aVthat this  is the greatest chemical factory
p8505
aV  but right now ill managed 
p8506
aVessentially  you are a lousy ceo  
p8507
aV that is true 
p8508
aVwhat has always  sadhguru  has also left me in wonderment at times about
p8509
aVthe usage of two words 
p8510
aVwhich i am going to say it to you right now 
p8511
aVterminology sometimes has a tendency of making you
p8512
aVeven receive an emotion from within 
p8513
aVtwo words being ego and self respect 
p8514
aVnow these are two pillars of 
p8515
aVwhat we believe is self confidence 
p8516
aVwhich is unfounded  i believe 
p8517
aVego
p8518
aV hey  who put a cow next to me  
p8519
aV sorry 
p8520
aV who put a cow next to me 
p8521
aV put a 
p8522
aVwell  topical at least  
p8523
aVit s part of the d cor or something 
p8524
aV because everywhere i go 
p8525
aVpeople have been asking me questions about gau rakshak 
p8526
aVgau rakshak  
p8527
aVnow they put a cow next to me  
p8528
aV well  i was planning not to go down that path but now 
p8529
aVthen since you brought it up 
p8530
aVno  no  not going there 
p8531
aVas i was saying about ego and self respect 
p8532
aVlike we always say 
p8533
aVlike my belief has always been that maintain your self respect  keep that 
p8534
aVyour ego can be flexible
p8535
aVbecause it should be convenient 
p8536
aVbecause i believe like your ego should be a function of your convenience  
p8537
aVhow true is that or maybe both are unfounded 
p8538
aV this ego should be a function of your convenience is perfect 
p8539
aVbut nobody knows where ego is within themselves 
p8540
aVdo you know 
p8541
aV no 
p8542
aV nobody knows 
p8543
aV it arises at will  i think 
p8544
aV no  no  no  ego is a fall guy 
p8545
aVwhen you do the good things  it s of course it s you who did it 
p8546
aVwhen you do nasty things
p8547
aV oh  it was my ego 
p8548
aVhe is a fall guy 
p8549
aVhe comes up whenever something goes wrong  
p8550
aVwhenever you are seen in a bad light 
p8551
aV it was my ego  it s not me 
p8552
aVso  people have created a whole
p8553
aVlot of jargon like this 
p8554
aV my ego  my self 
p8555
aVmy consciousness 
p8556
aVmy super consciousness  many things 
p8557
aVfirst everybody must decide
p8558
aVwithin this body of yours  how many people are residing  you must tell me  
p8559
aVif there is anything more than one 
p8560
aVit means you  either you are schizophrenic or you are possessed  
p8561
aVyou need either a psychiatrist or an exorcist  
p8562
aVso you are an individual 
p8563
aVan individual means not further divisible  
p8564
aVindivisible 
p8565
aVthis is why you are an individual 
p8566
aVthat means there is only one 
p8567
aVthis is the healthiest state to be  that you understand
p8568
aVthere is only you here 
p8569
aVnobody else but you 
p8570
aVif you realize this 
p8571
aVthen you will function completely differently 
p8572
aVbut you start playing this game  
p8573
aVwhenever you are in difficulty  you say   it was my ego 
p8574
aVwhenever something else happens  you say   it s myself 
p8575
aVanother time you say   my lower self  higher self   
p8576
aVall kinds of stuff 
p8577
aVmany identities within you 
p8578
aVsee  this is the nature of a criminal   alias  alias  alias  alias  you know 
p8579
aVso  it s a crime that you started 
p8580
aVwhether you will be caught in the web of that or you will manage doing
p8581
aVsee  if you do minimal amount of crime  you may manage 
p8582
aVonly when you really get into it 
p8583
aVthen you may get into the web 
p8584
aVotherwise  many people commit small time crime
p8585
aVand then become very respectable in the society  
p8586
aVso  if you do little crime of ego business  self business 
p8587
aVall this and then become normal  you re okay 
p8588
aVbut if you play it too much 
p8589
aVyou will become mentally ill 
p8590
aVbecause if there is more than one in this  
p8591
aVyou will become sick 
p8592
aVthere you are an individual  you are just one 
p8593
aVnow it s very easy to transform this  
p8594
aVyou can t transform a crowd of people 
p8595
aVyou can only transform individual people  
p8596
aVand if you take away this fall guy 
p8597
aVone fundamental thing you have to do with yourself is
p8598
aVto see that no matter what happens in my life 
p8599
aVif pleasant things happen 
p8600
aVif unpleasant things happen 
p8601
aVwhether i am joyful or miserable 
p8602
aVi m successful or a failure 
p8603
aVyou know it s just you 
p8604
aVyou and you alone 
p8605
aVotherwise  when things happen well   me 
p8606
aVwhen things don t happen well 
p8607
aV so you say we always tend to blame ourselves into various parts
p8608
aVand then divine forces as well 
p8609
aV it s convenient 
p8610
aVit s very convenient 
p8611
aVbut this self respect  
p8612
aVno  no  you should have no self respect 
p8613
aVothers 
p8614
aVrespect is from another person 
p8615
aV i respect myself   
p8616
aVwhat is this rubbish  
p8617
aVsomebody else respects you because they see some value to you  it s nice  
p8618
aVbut  i respect myself    what is this 
p8619
aVthis is 
p8620
aVthis is  it s gone further in the west
p8621
aVand people say   i love myself 
p8622
aVsee  to respect  to love 
p8623
aVthe very word they are using is
p8624
aVthere must be two 
p8625
aVyou can love somebody 
p8626
aVsomebody can love you 
p8627
aVyou can respect somebody  somebody can respect you 
p8628
aVbut  i love myself  i respect myself 
p8629
aVthis terminology is the terminology of the insane 
p8630
aVbut it s becoming popular
p8631
aVbecause the numbers are growing  
p8632
aV by the hour  
p8633
aV hey  don t say by the hour  
p8634
aVthen we will be blamed  
p8635
aVby the day  
p8636
aV by the day  okay  we get that 
p8637
aVwe sign seal and deliver that  
p8638
aVis there a ceiling to extremity 
p8639
aVto extreme emotion like love 
p8640
aVwhen you love something 
p8641
aVis there a time that you have to stop 
p8642
aVis there any such thing as stopping the extent of your extreme emotion 
p8643
aVand i feel that about even the negative emotions 
p8644
aVwhen you love someone 
p8645
aVhow do you really stop the extent of it 
p8646
aV i would say
p8647
aVplease  i want you to listen to this carefully because
p8648
aVyou will immediately tweet 
p8649
aV sadhguru said this   
p8650
aVit s a dangerous world today 
p8651
aVif you love  love strong 
p8652
aVif you hate  hate strong 
p8653
aVwhatever the hell you do  live strong 
p8654
aVit s very important 
p8655
aVotherwise  you will live an insipid life  
p8656
aVnot knowing a thing about anything 
p8657
aVin
p8658
aVwhen adiyogi gave the yogic principles 
p8659
aVhe said anything in your life 
p8660
aVit doesn t matter what
p8661
aVi have been telling people  they re not grasping it 
p8662
aVthey think 
p8663
aVbecause too much this  you know  what to say 
p8664
aVflowery teachings have gone into people 
p8665
aVthey re not looking at what works and what doesn t work 
p8666
aVthey want something pretty 
p8667
aVi am not interested in what s pretty and not pretty 
p8668
aVwhether it works or not is the only thing 
p8669
aVultimately  what works is very fantastic  
p8670
aVso  even if it s anger  
p8671
aVnot necessarily love or compassion 
p8672
aVeven if it is anger   just stay on it for twenty four hours 
p8673
aVanybody  i m saying just try this by yourself 
p8674
aVtwenty four hours stay intensely angry  let me see 
p8675
aVbelieve me  at the end of twenty four hours or well before that 
p8676
aVyou will be enlightened 
p8677
aVbut you will see you are not capable of being angry
p8678
aVbecause to stay intensely angry 
p8679
aVyou need enormous energy 
p8680
aVit burns you up 
p8681
aVtry one day 
p8682
aVtwenty four hours stay angry 
p8683
aVyou are irritated  that you can manage for the rest of your life  
p8684
aVstay angry  really super angry for twenty four hours 
p8685
aVlet me see 
p8686
aVyou can t manage more than three minutes  believe me 
p8687
aVyou will feel drained out because it takes enormous energy 
p8688
aVthere are yogis  who live like this 
p8689
aVthey are simply angry all the time 
p8690
aVall the time  not about anybody or anything 
p8691
aVsimply angry  just like that 
p8692
aVit works wonderfully 
p8693
aVit works much better and quicker than love 
p8694
aVonly thing is 
p8695
aVwith that kind of practice within you 
p8696
aVwith that kind of emotion within you 
p8697
aVyou can t live in social atmospheres 
p8698
aVyou ll have to withdraw to a mountain cave
p8699
aVand simply be angry about nothing 
p8700
aVjust like that 
p8701
aVif you want to live in social atmospheres 
p8702
aVyou need to be in a pleasant state of emotion 
p8703
aVotherwise you will get into constant mess 
p8704
aVso  should i stop myself somewhere 
p8705
aVwhat you are asking is 
p8706
aV should i be constipated about my love   
p8707
aVat least in love  know some sense of abandon 
p8708
aVthat there is no brakes on it 
p8709
aVi would say on everything in your life
p8710
aVin your car  you must pull out all the pedals 
p8711
aVonly throttle should be there 
p8712
aVyes 
p8713
aVin your life  there should be only throttle
p8714
aVbecause brake will happen when you die 
p8715
aVit s not for you to brake every day  
p8716
aVit s not for you to control 
p8717
aVyour life will be curtailed somewhere 
p8718
aVthat s nature s business 
p8719
aVyour business is to be full on because
p8720
aVlife  life needs your support 
p8721
aVdeath is super efficient 
p8722
aVdid you ever see death happening inefficiently 
p8723
aVhello  
p8724
aVwherever it happened it was a perfect death  isn t it  
p8725
aVnever happened inefficiently
p8726
aVbut life happens inefficiently 
p8727
aVlife needs constant support 
p8728
aVdeath does not need your support 
p8729
aVstopping something is death in a way 
p8730
aVso to love  you re afraid 
p8731
aVto laugh  you re afraid 
p8732
aVto cry you re afraid 
p8733
aVto everything 
p8734
aVnothing is done with abandon  everything with constipation  
p8735
aVlearn to do something with abandon because
p8736
aVif you do not know at least how to scream in abandon 
p8737
aVthere is no way you will ever know how to meditate
p8738
aVor to be spiritual 
p8739
aVbecause spirituality is a state of total abandon 
p8740
aVcomplete state of abandon  
p8741
aV i endorse that
p8742
aVand i will try and live by that 
p8743
aVbut what happens when a positive emotion reaches its extreme stage 
p8744
aVand ventures into a dark area 
p8745
aVlike love can also transfer itself into obsession 
p8746
aV see 
p8747
aVyou are referring to
p8748
aVsee  it s like this 
p8749
aVsuppose you don t have legs
p8750
aVand if i say   come  dance 
p8751
aVyou say   no  i cannot even walk without my crutch 
p8752
aVso  i cannot walk without my crutch 
p8753
aVor  i cannot live without you  are not different 
p8754
aVthis is a very dangerous territory i am entering  
p8755
aVbut it is a fact 
p8756
aV i cannot walk without a crutch 
p8757
aVor  i cannot live without you  is the same thing
p8758
aVbecause you re misunderstanding your dependence
p8759
aVand a certain relationship that you hold with somebody as love 
p8760
aVlet s look at this thing of what is love 
p8761
aVsee  it s a certain blossoming within you 
p8762
aVnow  who are you in your life 
p8763
aVwho are you using as the manure 
p8764
aVfilth 
p8765
aVsee  this flower is fragrant 
p8766
aVnot because somebody sprayed perfume to the roots 
p8767
aVit is fragrant because somebody put filth to the roots  isn t it 
p8768
aVso now  you found a little flower within you of love 
p8769
aVwho is your manure 
p8770
aVwho is your filth 
p8771
aVnow this is a dangerous territory for me to enter with you also  
p8772
aVbut this is exactly what we are doing 
p8773
aVnow the question is just this 
p8774
aVwhatever is the most pleasant emotion within you 
p8775
aVare you capable of bringing it on by yourself 
p8776
aVor are you in a dilapidated condition of technology 
p8777
aVthat you are a push start machine 
p8778
aVthat somebody has to push you 
p8779
aVotherwise you cannot be 
p8780
aVyour joy  your love  your peace  your ecstasy
p8781
aVmust be your making  isn t it 
p8782
aVso now  your love will become about sharing your joy 
p8783
aVnot squeezing joy out of somebody 
p8784
aVright now  most people s joy  most people s idea of a love affair
p8785
aVis more like a mutual benefit scheme  
p8786
aV you give me this  i ll give you that 
p8787
aVyou can t live without me  i can t live without you 
p8788
aVthey will make sure that the other person also becomes invalid
p8789
aVand cannot live without me 
p8790
ag8713
aVthis is a very  a very huge problem in the human societies 
p8791
aVlove is not happening as a flowering 
p8792
aVit is something that we are trying to suck out of somebody 
p8793
aVlove is not about somebody 
p8794
aVi want you to know this 
p8795
aVmaybe because you re a film personality maybe
p8796
aVyou said you are not an actor but
p8797
aVthere are many actors  who are loved by people 
p8798
aVpeople are in  drooling with ecstasy simply looking at them 
p8799
aVbut the problem is they ve never seen them 
p8800
aVthey ve only seen that play of light and sound 
p8801
aVthey ve never seen them but they love them 
p8802
aVso what i am saying is 
p8803
aVyou are capable of loving somebody  that person may not exist 
p8804
aVhe may be animated 
p8805
aVbut you still love and you are experiencing all the fruits of love 
p8806
aVi am saying  love is something that you do within yourself
p8807
aVand blame it on somebody  
p8808
aVyou can do it by yourself 
p8809
aVfor a long time in this country  it s been there 
p8810
aVthere have been meerabais and tukarams and others 
p8811
aVthey taught you  you don t have  to love and to be in an extreme state of love 
p8812
aVyou don t need anybody 
p8813
aVyou can simply do it by yourself 
p8814
aVand not just in emotion 
p8815
aVeven physical ecstasies happened to them 
p8816
aVsimply because they are in a great love affair
p8817
aVwith someone who is not even here  all right 
p8818
aVso  it is something that you do within yourself 
p8819
aVright now  you are in love with somebody here 
p8820
aVthat somebody may not even know that you love them 
p8821
aVbut you can experience this  isn t it 
p8822
aVyou don t need the support from the other person 
p8823
aVthis is an experience that s happening within you 
p8824
aVlove is within you if you wish 
p8825
aVit is not that it s sitting within you 
p8826
aVthere is no such thing 
p8827
aVyou are capable of variety of emotions 
p8828
aVif you want  you can make it's very sweet emotion 
p8829
aVif you are in a very sweet state of emotion 
p8830
aVpeople say   oh  he s very loving 
p8831
aVyou may not be loving in the real context of how they understand 
p8832
aVbut you are in a pleasant state of emotion 
p8833
aVso naturally you do pleasant things 
p8834
aVso people think you love them 
p8835
aV so make love an island  not a country 
p8836
aV no  no  make love the universe  not an island  
p8837
aVbecause right now  when you say  i love you 
p8838
aVthis particular person  you only 
p8839
aVwhen i look at these people  i look at them like this  
p8840
aVthis one person  ahh  
p8841
aVthis is an island love  
p8842
aVit is too discriminatory 
p8843
aVthis one face in these 10000 faces i love 
p8844
aVrest   depressing looking at them 
p8845
aVthis is a very island love 
p8846
aVi know you are in an island city 
p8847
aVbut it s time 
p8848
aV to go beyond 
p8849
aV  it s time that you understand
p8850
aVlove is a happening within you 
p8851
aVmaybe somebody stimulated this 
p8852
aVyou are grateful for them
p8853
aVthat they ignited this within you 
p8854
aVbut love affair is yours  isn t it 
p8855
aVit s an inner experience that s happening to you 
p8856
aVsomebody is providing the stimulus 
p8857
aVwe are grateful to them  that they are providing this 
p8858
aVbut they are not causing it 
p8859
aVit s been caused from within 
p8860
aVand once you understand this 
p8861
aVwhy wouldn t you be walking on the street lovingly 
p8862
aVwhy wouldn t you look at a tree lovingly 
p8863
aVwhy wouldn t you look at a buffalo lovingly 
p8864
aVwhy wouldn t you look at the cloud lovingly 
p8865
aVbecause it is not something that ll get over 
p8866
aV should i control it 
p8867
aVwhy 
p8868
aVwill it get over 
p8869
aVthere is no such danger 
p8870
aVit doesn t get over 
p8871
aVin fact  almost everything that you experience 
p8872
aVthe more you exercise it  the more it s available to you 
p8873
aVwhether it s your love  or joy  or hate  or anger 
p8874
aVthe more you exercise it  the more it s available to you
p8875
aVbecause it s after all your making 
p8876
aVit s entirely your making 
p8877
aVso when it s your making 
p8878
aVwhy don t you enjoy it every moment of your life 
p8879
aVsomebody is there  nobody is there 
p8880
aVwhat is the problem  
p8881
aV well  that brings me to  i think the
p8882
aVi believe the mother of a virus that plagues a large part of humanity is expectation 
p8883
aVi have a simple theory that i try to expect less
p8884
aVbecause then i feel that i ll be disappointed less  
p8885
aVand i feel to curtail your expectation is possibly the toughest thing to do
p8886
aVbecause we constantly expect from relationships 
p8887
aVfrom the work we do  from 
p8888
aV you are just talking to the wrong guy about this expectation  
p8889
aVi have the highest expectation of every human being on the planet 
p8890
aVand i know  and i know they will disappoint me 
p8891
aVi will die disappointed but joyfully disappointed  
p8892
aV now joyful disappointment is a place  sir  that you ve reached  
p8893
aVbut that is not a easy place to reach for most of us 
p8894
aV no  no  no 
p8895
aVsee  these things are not like that 
p8896
aVto be joyful or miserable is essentially your choice 
p8897
aVit s a choice that you are making within yourself 
p8898
aVmaybe it s an unconscious choice 
p8899
aVanything that you do unconsciously
p8900
aVright now  unconsciously my hand can fly 
p8901
aVbut what i can do unconsciously 
p8902
aVi can do the same thing definitely consciously also  isn t it  tch 
p8903
aVthis is the fundamental difference between being human and every other creature 
p8904
aVwe are not doing anything different from what they are doing 
p8905
aVwe are doing the same things 
p8906
aVbut we do it little more consciously 
p8907
aVsuddenly it s a different affair altogether 
p8908
aVsame things  
p8909
aVwe eat  they eat 
p8910
aVthey sleep  we sleep 
p8911
aVthey reproduce  we reproduce 
p8912
aVthey die  we die 
p8913
aVonly thing is we are doing it little more consciously 
p8914
aVsuddenly it looks like another world by itself 
p8915
aVwe think we are above them
p8916
aVonly because we can do the same silly little things little more consciously 
p8917
aVso  if i can move my hand unconsciously 
p8918
aVi can also move it consciously 
p8919
aVif i can become joyful unconsciously 
p8920
aVi can also become joyful consciously 
p8921
aVif i am joyful because of my choice 
p8922
aVsuppose disappointments are thrown at me 
p8923
aVi will be joyfully disappointed  
p8924
aVand my expectations of people are very  very high 
p8925
aVi have an impossible expectation 
p8926
aVso i know i will die joyfully  blissfully disappointed
p8927
aVbecause i know the nature of the world very well 
p8928
aVi am not somebody who lives in fancy la la land  
p8929
aV so  abundant love and no curtail on expectation 
p8930
aV oh
p8931
aVsee  love is not a quantity  it s a quality 
p8932
aVit is not that if you do certain amount of things  you are loving 
p8933
ag8827
aVyou can sit here  eyes closed  not look at anybody
p8934
aVand still be loving because
p8935
aVit s essentially pleasantness of your emotion 
p8936
aVhow pleasant 
p8937
aVi am asking  is there any need to curtail pleasantness within you 
p8938
aVnow i am super pleasant 
p8939
aVbut if a child came 
p8940
aVi may grab him and put him on my lap 
p8941
aVif an adult comes  you don t do that  
p8942
aVi ll do this   okay 
p8943
aVhere dog came  i ll just do this  
p8944
aVbut an adult comes  another person comes  you don t do this  to them 
p8945
aVi am saying your expression will change from person to person 
p8946
aVfrom relationship to relationship 
p8947
aVwhat kind of intimacy and what kind of closeness you have with people 
p8948
aVbut does it mean to say that you should not this 
p8949
aVwith as much love as you hug somebody or kiss somebody 
p8950
aVshould you not 
p8951
aVshould you not do namaskaram with as much love as you hugged your child 
p8952
aVwhy not  i am asking 
p8953
aVbecause there is no
p8954
aVsee  this  i m  i m trying to demolish the word abundance because
p8955
aVwhen you say abundance  there is also scarcity 
p8956
ag8827
aVit is neither abundant nor scarce 
p8957
aVif you are willing  it s on 
p8958
aVif you are not willing  it s off  that s all  
p8959
aV as simple as that  
p8960
aVfundamentally  there is always a need 
p8961
aVa need for so many things 
p8962
aVeven when  in your process 
p8963
aVyour professional process or where you garner wealth or income
p8964
aVand you keep going 
p8965
aVthere is a need to constantly get more than what you have 
p8966
aVthere is no satisfaction and a place to stop 
p8967
aVis there an end to need 
p8968
ag8895
aVthere should not be an end 
p8969
aVit is just that
p8970
aVnow that you are asking this question 
p8971
aVin some way you have realized that at every point of your life 
p8972
aVyou thought   this is it  if this one thing happens  i am fulfilled 
p8973
aVbut the very next day you realize that this is not it  there is one more thing and one more thing 
p8974
aVand you know that after ten years still the same state will continue 
p8975
aVso this means you are ready for yoga  
p8976
aVthis means you have understood that your longing is not for more 
p8977
aVyour longing is for all 
p8978
aVyour longing to expand is not just for more  it is for all 
p8979
ag7639
aVyour longing is in some way for infinite expansion 
p8980
aVif you handle your infinite expansion unconsciously
p8981
aVand if it finds a very basic physical expression 
p8982
aVwe call this sexuality 
p8983
aVwhat you are trying to do is 
p8984
aVsomething that is not you 
p8985
aVwith physical contact you are trying to make it a part of yourself 
p8986
aVyou know it doesn t work 
p8987
aVif you try emotionally  we call this love 
p8988
aVemotionally you are trying to include something which is not you as a part of yourself 
p8989
aVthis is your love affair 
p8990
aVif you do it mentally  this gets labeled as greed 
p8991
aVambition  conquest or simply shopping  
p8992
aVif you do it consciously  then we call this yoga 
p8993
aVyoga means union 
p8994
aVyou re longing to expand infinitely
p8995
aVbut because of little constipation in the head 
p8996
aVyou are going in installments 
p8997
aVcan you go in installments and become infinite  i am asking 
p8998
aVis it possible 
p8999
aVcan you count one  two  three  four and one day say infinity 
p9000
aVno  you will become endless counting 
p9001
aVso your longing is not for this much or that much 
p9002
aVyour longing is for everything 
p9003
aVif you want everything  you must understand that
p9004
aVyou cannot do that physically 
p9005
aVit can only happen in a dimension beyond physical
p9006
aVbecause physicality exists only because of defined boundaries 
p9007
aVbut there is something within you  which doesn t like this boundary 
p9008
aVwhich wants to stretch the boundary 
p9009
aVstretch the boundary 
p9010
ag9010
aVyou are looking for boundlessness 
p9011
aVbut you are not courageous enough or conscious enough to admit this 
p9012
aVyou want to go in installments 
p9013
aVno  what you are looking is for boundlessness 
p9014
aVif you want boundlessness 
p9015
aVit can never ever happen through physical means 
p9016
aVso once it doesn t happen through physical means 
p9017
aVnow you use the most corrupted word called spiritual 
p9018
aVspiritual does not mean looking up or looking down 
p9019
aVgoing here  going there 
p9020
aVit simply means your experience of life transcended the limitations of being just physical 
p9021
aVbecause everything that s physical about you is an acquired quantity  isn t it 
p9022
aVthis is just a piece of this planet 
p9023
aVwhat is up here is just a heap of impressions that you have gathered 
p9024
aVso what you have acquired can be yours 
p9025
aVcan never be you 
p9026
aVso this longing to have more money 
p9027
aVmore property 
p9028
aVmore pleasure 
p9029
aVmore something is not about those things 
p9030
aVyou are trying to find that dimension beyond physical nature 
p9031
aVbut because of constipation  it s not happening   
p9032
aV i m going to take the liberty  sadhguru 
p9033
aVto do what i normally do on my television show 
p9034
aVwhich is a rapid fire round 
p9035
aV mhmm   
p9036
aV the  normally the end of this round
p9037
aV  see  i ve  when i was young 
p9038
aVi watched a lot of  you know 
p9039
aVwild west movies  
p9040
aVwhen you fire  i also fire  all right  
p9041
aV no  but i promise you 
p9042
aVthis is not that kind of
p9043
aVyou are not in my line of fire  at all 
p9044
aVi will not take the liberty of being that person  
p9045
aVthese are just quick questions  which when i ask for one word 
p9046
aVyou have to stick to that
p9047
aVbecause sometimes you have a tendency of not exactly answering the question asked  
p9048
aVbut you give such a profound and prolific retort back
p9049
aVthat it makes you very satiated 
p9050
aVbut in this case 
p9051
aVmy only request is that if it s one word 
p9052
aVthen it s just one word  
p9053
aV okay 
p9054
aV and the end of this normally 
p9055
aVyou get a hamper  
p9056
aVbut in the absence of a hamper here 
p9057
aVyou already have
p9058
aV a cow  
p9059
aV  something right  yes 
p9060
aVso   and  or this beautiful bouquet that is right next to you 
p9061
aVbut so there is no hamper
p9062
aVbut you do will get my utmost gratitude  
p9063
aVthank you 
p9064
aV all right  very simply 
p9065
aVwhat is the one thing that is essential to living a balanced life 
p9066
aV sense  
p9067
aV what is the one thing we must absolutely do away with in order to lead a balanced life 
p9068
aV senselessness  
p9069
aV all right 
p9070
aVi thought that was coming 
p9071
aVfirst thing that comes to your mind when i say the following  
p9072
aVthe first thing  organized religion 
p9073
aV madness 
p9074
aV marriage 
p9075
aV cohabitation  
p9076
aV competition 
p9077
aV stupid 
p9078
aV money 
p9079
aV useful 
p9080
aV love 
p9081
aV can i say a sentence  
p9082
ag8395
aVi will allow that  
p9083
aV most beautiful but unfortunately crippling for most people  
p9084
aVif i can little elaborate that
p9085
aVsee  if something unpleasant cripples you 
p9086
aVsomething nasty cripples you  tch 
p9087
aVit s acceptable 
p9088
aVwhen something beautiful cripples you 
p9089
aVit s a true disaster   
p9090
aV if you could ask one person alive or dead 
p9091
aVone question 
p9092
aVwho would you ask and what would that be  
p9093
aV i really sorted out all my questions
p9094
aVbecause i did not spend time educating myself or doing anything 
p9095
aVi spent my entire life sorting out every damn question i had 
p9096
aVi kind of run out of questions  
p9097
aV and you certainly have not run out of any answers 
p9098
aVand you never will 
p9099
aVbest advice you have ever received 
p9100
aV nothing 
p9101
aV never 
p9102
aV no  i never sought  nor did i receive 
p9103
aVi made myself in such a way 
p9104
aVi m incapable either of seeking advice or giving advice  
p9105
aV in an imaginary 
p9106
aVcompletely hypothetical situation 
p9107
aVif you had a day off with no commitments 
p9108
aVno responsibilities 
p9109
aVwhat would you spend the day doing 
p9110
aV oh  there re lot of things 
p9111
aVthis can't be one word  
p9112
aV no  it s not one word 
p9113
aV see  i have an indiscriminate sense of passion towards everything 
p9114
aVthere were lots and lots of things i did at one time
p9115
aVbut these days  time is not allowing me to do that 
p9116
aVso generally if i have little time  all i do is play golf
p9117
aVbecause that s safe and within the city and i can get back in time for something else to be done 
p9118
aVbut if an entire day is left to me  
p9119
aVwhich they have not done for a long time  
p9120
aVthey ve not left it to me  
p9121
aVif that happens  i will close my eyes and sit
p9122
aVbecause that is my  the best  the best 
p9123
aVi am at my best when i truly have nothing to do  
p9124
aV what is one thing you d like people to remember about you at the end of your life 
p9125
aV they must live so wonderfully that they don t even remember me  
p9126
aV if you found a way to travel through time  where would you go 
p9127
aV i m kind of done with all those things  
p9128
aV you re universe visited already 
p9129
aVyou have visas for every part  of this ecosystem 
p9130
aV if we can do some slow fire 
p9131
ag7920
aV  because that s a question with many ramifications 
p9132
aVthis 
p9133
aVfor example  traveling in the world 
p9134
aVwe ve jetted around and now we want to travel to the mars 
p9135
aVwe want to travel to another place 
p9136
aVand now that s not enough 
p9137
aVwe want to travel into the past and future 
p9138
aVall this longing is again exploratory in nature 
p9139
aVwhether you go on vacation to maldives
p9140
aVor you want to go to mars 
p9141
aVit is fundamentally exploratory 
p9142
aVmaybe you re also thinking of relaxation and pleasure and whatever 
p9143
aVbut essentially it s exploratory 
p9144
aVotherwise why can t you do it here 
p9145
aVit s something that you want to do 
p9146
aVyou want to touch another place 
p9147
aVthis longing is there in the human being
p9148
aVonly as long as the life that you are remains in a seed form 
p9149
aVthat is  it did not sprout and blossom 
p9150
ag7865
aVwhen adiyogi was expounding the science of yoga
p9151
aVand talking about the nature of the cosmos 
p9152
aVhow it s related to your individual self
p9153
aVand what you can do with it 
p9154
aVthen the seven sages who were with him 
p9155
aVthey asked   what is the nature of this cosmos 
p9156
aVhow big is it 
p9157
aVwhere does it begin  where does it end 
p9158
aVso he laughed and said 
p9159
aV your entire cosmos  i can pack it into a mustard seed 
p9160
aVbecause your ideas of time and space are essentially because
p9161
aVyou re living within the framework of your intellect 
p9162
aVif you cross that dimension 
p9163
aVthen there is no such thing as time and space 
p9164
aVeverything is here and now 
p9165
aVso  traveling through time  space  
p9166
aVno  it means nothing to me because 
p9167
aVit s difficult to express 
p9168
aVdifficult to articulate 
p9169
aVif i sound little
p9170
aVi have a reputation of being very logical
p9171
aVbut if i sound illogical or silly to you 
p9172
aVyou can blame it on my jetlag 
p9173
aVi ve just come from united states after six weeks 
p9174
aVso you can say   maybe he was jetlagged 
p9175
aVthat s why sadhguru s saying something silly 
p9176
aVbut i m fine 
p9177
aVi m saying this because
p9178
aVyou can't fit the universe into your silly little logic 
p9179
aVtoday s human being is too overly enamored with their own logic 
p9180
aVthat they re missing the entire life 
p9181
aVthe gamut of phenomena that s happening in the existence is missed
p9182
aVbecause the only way you can accept anything is
p9183
aVit has to fit into the square hole of your logic 
p9184
aVanything that doesn t fit into your logic  you will reject 
p9185
aVin this  you ve rejected the entire cosmos 
p9186
aVin this  you ve rejected the magic of life 
p9187
aVyou have become a slave of logic
p9188
aVand completely missing the magic of life 
p9189
aVso  this time  space  all this stuff is because
p9190
aVintellectually you re trying to dissect the universe
p9191
aVand try to understand this  this  this 
p9192
aVtell me  if you sit here 
p9193
aVsuppose you re very joyful 
p9194
aVdo you see 
p9195
aVyou will not know how the day passed off 
p9196
aVand if you re depressed  do you see the day won t pass 
p9197
aVso time is a consequence of the miserable nature of human existence 
p9198
aVif you were truly blissed out and ecstatic 
p9199
aVyou wouldn t know what is a day 
p9200
aVwhat is a year 
p9201
aVwhat is a lifetime 
p9202
aVyou wouldn t know 
p9203
aVthere ve been times  i sat down  i didn t realize  i thought it s five minutes
p9204
aVbut people gathered around and started molesting my feet  
p9205
aVno  because they 
p9206
aVin their understanding i sat there for many days or whatever 
p9207
aVthis idea of time and space is a very convoluted idea 
p9208
aVsimply because people are stuck in the framework of their logic 
p9209
aVmy work 
p9210
aVmy fundamental work is to take people
p9211
aVbeyond the framework of logic into the true magic of existence 
p9212
aVour own existence 
p9213
aVbut it takes a lot of time 
p9214
aVstill my reputation is of being very logically correct
p9215
aVbecause i m still trying to woo them  tch  
p9216
aVstill wooing them  you know  
p9217
aVfor the real thing to happen 
p9218
aVthey will take a long time unfortunately
p9219
aVbecause they have become such slaves of their logic 
p9220
aV what is the first thing you notice when you meet a person 
p9221
aV just everything 
p9222
aV everything 
p9223
aV everything  past  present and future   
p9224
aV is it more important to do what you love or love what you re doing 
p9225
aV one word or more  
p9226
aV the choice is entirely yours 
p9227
aV see  if you are an intelligent person  you will try to do what you love most 
p9228
aVbut if you re a genius  you will do just what is needed  
p9229
aV if you could be invisible for a day  what would you do  
p9230
aV you wouldn t know  
p9231
aV with due respect  what is your biggest weakness 
p9232
aV hmm  biggest  
p9233
aV what is your biggest weakness 
p9234
aV see  what normally people treat as weakness in their lives 
p9235
aVokay 
p9236
aVlet me give a normal answer 
p9237
ag8868
aVwhy am i going into all this 
p9238
aValready you said i m  what  what is the word 
p9239
aVsashayed   hmm  
p9240
aVmy biggest weakness is i love danger 
p9241
aVwithout danger  i cannot live 
p9242
aVi need to do something  which 
p9243
aVwhich keeps me on the edge of being mortal 
p9244
aVbeing alive and dead 
p9245
aVi want to walk that line all the time 
p9246
aVevery day i m stepping on it one way or the other  
p9247
aVis it a weakness 
p9248
aVi don t think so  but people think 
p9249
aV sadhguru  you shouldn t risk your life like this 
p9250
aVbut if there s no risk  i m feel 
p9251
aVi feel i m not being 
p9252
aVbecause most of the time in my life 
p9253
aVfor whatever i m doing 
p9254
aVi don t feel tested 
p9255
aVit s only in moments of danger that i feel little tested 
p9256
aVso my weakness is  i like to be stretched  you know 
p9257
aVfor all the time when i was riding across india and later on i started driving 
p9258
aVmy only wish was that 
p9259
aVto find a machine  which will test my skills 
p9260
aValways found the damn things broke down if i took it to my limits 
p9261
aVthese days recently  i m beginning to get to do a few machines 
p9262
aVwhich are testing me  whether i can push it all the way or not  
p9263
aVmaybe that s because of my age  
p9264
ag8542
aV if i had met them much younger 
p9265
aVi think i would have
p9266
aV you would have managed to work around them  
p9267
aVone thing the world doesn t know about you 
p9268
aV they don t know a thing about me  
p9269
aVthat s a fact  
p9270
aV and the one thing you wish you could change about yourself 
p9271
aV oh  i never looked at that  
p9272
aVi could speak hindi  
p9273
aVno  i m sorry  marathi  
p9274
aV the one thing you wish you could change about the world 
p9275
aV tch  oh  a lot of things 
p9276
aV one 
p9277
aV human beings  
p9278
aV desperately in need of  
p9279
aVsir  what would you consider to be your greatest achievement 
p9280
aV i don t think there s any
p9281
aVbecause i always fall woefully short of my own expectation of what i could do  
p9282
aVso  i never feel anything is an achievement  
p9283
aV is there a song you love and can listen to all the time 
p9284
aV oh   i somehow 
p9285
aV 
p9286
aVno  
p9287
aVprobably because this came to me at a certain time
p9288
aVwhen i was in my early teens maybe 
p9289
aVso this one song kind of comes back to me more often than anything else 
p9290
aVit s not that i even seek it but somehow 
p9291
aVone way or the other  this song keeps coming back to me 
p9292
aVis
p9293
aV how many times    
p9294
aV okay  okay  i know you haven t seen any of my films
p9295
aVbut do you have a favorite film 
p9296
aV oh  i ve seen many good movies 
p9297
aVat one time  i saw a lot of them 
p9298
aVi ve not seen much of indian cinema
p9299
aVbut i saw a lot of  you know  english cinema 
p9300
aVbut one movie that i thoroughly  thoroughly enjoyed at that time
p9301
aVbecause on that day the way things happened 
p9302
aVmany life situations fell together and everything 
p9303
aVwas roman holiday 
p9304
aV oh  
p9305
aVwell  i have to say that that s the first film i ve ever seen in my life 
p9306
aVmy mother took me to the cinema  
p9307
aV here we are 
p9308
aV it is true 
p9309
aVroman holiday is the first film i ever saw 
p9310
aVit was my introduction to the big screen  
p9311
aVi m glad i have something in common with you  
p9312
aV that image of audrey and gregory peck is  somehow just stayed with me  
p9313
aV wonderful 
p9314
aV it was probably my age  
p9315
aV yeah  it must have been 
p9316
aVsomething you enjoy doing and wish you had more time for 
p9317
aV i wish i had more time because
p9318
aVi made myself like this 
p9319
aVthat there is nothing that i enjoy or do not enjoy 
p9320
aVi make sure i enjoy everything that i do 
p9321
aVincluding simply sitting quietly  or talking to somebody 
p9322
aVor doing whatever  because my activity is not limited to one area 
p9323
aVso many things 
p9324
aVif you did not enjoy everything that you do and do not do 
p9325
aVyou will go insane trying to manage so many things 
p9326
aVbut i ll not go insane because i enjoy being alive 
p9327
aVactivity is 
p9328
aVanything is okay 
p9329
aVeverything i do  i enjoy  
p9330
aVsmall things  big things  every kind of thing 
p9331
aVmost profound things and silly things 
p9332
aVi enjoy thoroughly   
p9333
aV as should us all 
p9334
aVlastly  in a biopic made on you  who would play you  
p9335
aV but who would make a biopic  first of all  
p9336
ag8542
aVthere would be lots of interested people 
p9337
aV maybe you should animate  
p9338
aV i don t think you would want that  
p9339
aVwell  that is the end of the rapid fire
p9340
aVand you totally deserve the hamper that doesn t exist on this platform  
p9341
aVbut it s a virtual hamper that i ve given to you with my  love  gratitude
p9342
aVand deepest amount of respect 
p9343
aVthank you   
p9344
aV thank you 
p9345
aV i think before we open questions to the house 
p9346
aVit s integral for me to share that
p9347
aVthe last week that i spent reading about you and hearing everything that you had to say  
p9348
aVso many people question you  including juhi   who s in the house  
p9349
aVit s been exhilarating  it s been enlightening and more than anything else 
p9350
aVi think it gave me a certain sense of understanding about where i am 
p9351
aVbeing at a crossroad of my life emotionally
p9352
aVand also now as a newfound parent 
p9353
aVi read some of what you had to say about even parenting 
p9354
aVto me  it was extremely enlightening to read that 
p9355
aVthat not to nurture the dos and don ts so strongly on your child 
p9356
aVwe all have theories of parenting
p9357
aVbut i think just what i imbibe from what you had to say is
p9358
aVthat if i am strong willed
p9359
aVand i exude a certain amount of pleasantness
p9360
aVand i give out the right amount of energies 
p9361
aVmy child and my children will emulate that  imbibe that
p9362
aVand i don t have to constantly force feed that knowledge on them 
p9363
aVthey will imbibe it from my energy source in any case 
p9364
aVthat is what i drew with  am i right 
p9365
aV no  
p9366
ag9054
aV see  one level right 
p9367
aVbut it s not question of energy and
p9368
aVdon t  don t make simple aspects of life mystical
p9369
aVbecause my entire life is dedicated to make mystical very approachable 
p9370
aVbut generally in the society 
p9371
aVpeople are trying to make simple aspects of life mystical 
p9372
aVrearing a child is not a mystical dimension of life 
p9373
aVit s
p9374
aVmillions of people have done it 
p9375
aVfor thousands of generations  people have done it 
p9376
aVwe are not reinventing anything here 
p9377
aVit s just a simple biological process 
p9378
aVevery creature does it 
p9379
aVa bird is teaching its offspring to  you know  find a worm
p9380
aVand a worm is teaching its offspring to escape the bird 
p9381
aVall kinds of things are happening in their own way 
p9382
aVsimilarly human beings are doing it 
p9383
aVbut as we get more educated 
p9384
aVwe become more fussy about it 
p9385
aVthere was a time that a whole lot of parents had eight ten children 
p9386
aVthey did not even know their names 
p9387
aVnumber one  number two  they called them  
p9388
aVbut they grew up somehow  
p9389
aVthey just provided the basic ecosystem and they just grew up 
p9390
aVso let s not make it too whatever because
p9391
aVyou can easily
p9392
aVbecause today is a time of just one child or two children
p9393
aVand we ve become totally 
p9394
aVoverly emotional about what is ours
p9395
aVand we lose perspective of what is the reality 
p9396
aVa child will grow up anyway 
p9397
aVif they re nourished  they will grow up 
p9398
aVnow what should they grow up as 
p9399
aVshould they grow up confused 
p9400
aVshould they grow up strong 
p9401
aVshould they grow up stable 
p9402
aVshould they become sage like 
p9403
aVshould they become something else 
p9404
aVthat s a question 
p9405
aVwhat they should become in the world is a social issue 
p9406
aVthat will be decided in the times in which they grow up and the exposure that they have 
p9407
aVnow you become a filmmaker
p9408
aVnot because you re intrinsically a filmmaker 
p9409
aVbecause you are in mumbai 
p9410
aVyou come from that kind of family and the atmosphere around you is like that 
p9411
aVnaturally you choose that 
p9412
aVsuppose you were somewhere else 
p9413
aVlet s say 1000 years ago you were somewhere else 
p9414
aVwould you be thinking of filmmaking 
p9415
aVno  you would be thinking of something else 
p9416
aVso what we do in our lives is just a circumstantial thing 
p9417
aVlet s not read too much into it 
p9418
aVthe question is 
p9419
aVwhen we have children  how complete and joyful and wonderful are they 
p9420
aVbecause every life is aspiring not to do this or that 
p9421
aVevery life is aspiring only to become a full fledged life 
p9422
aVthat s all 
p9423
aVwhether it s a worm  insect  or plant  or tree 
p9424
aVthey re only aspiring to become a full fledged life 
p9425
aVthere is no other aspiration in life  including ourselves 
p9426
aVonly problem with the human being is 
p9427
aVwe know what is a full fledged worm 
p9428
aVwe know what is a full fledged mango tree 
p9429
aVbut we don t know what is a full fledged human being 
p9430
aVthis is the only problem 
p9431
aVmy work is just this 
p9432
aVto make people perceive 
p9433
aVnot understand  
p9434
aVyou must understand the difference or the distinction
p9435
aVbetween perceiving  experiencing and understanding  
p9436
aVnot understand  but perceive and experience what it means to be a full fledged life human being 
p9437
aVand that s all that must happen to your children and every other children
p9438
aVevery other child on the planet 
p9439
aVwhat should happen 
p9440
aVthey must become full fledged life  that s all 
p9441
aVfor this 
p9442
aVthey need an ecosystem and nourishment 
p9443
aVnot teaching from another time 
p9444
aVbecause you belong to an another time  you are past 
p9445
aVyou may not like it 
p9446
aVi am not saying as a director  you are past 
p9447
aVi am saying   in terms of time  compared to your children  you are past  okay 
p9448
aVso one important thing that we need to do when we have children is 
p9449
ag8045
aVto help them not to get overly identified with us 
p9450
aVthis is to make an investment  
p9451
aVheavy investment
p9452
aVchild means  
p9453
aVbut not expect any return 
p9454
aVtch  tch  tch 
p9455
aVthis is difficult for a stock market world 
p9456
aVhow to make an investment without return 
p9457
aVbut this is what bringing up a child means 
p9458
aVyou want to make a heavy investment  no return expected 
p9459
aVthis is all 
p9460
aVif you want to
p9461
aVbecause i have 
p9462
aVyou know  in raising my girl   i won t go into the lengthy affair  
p9463
aVbut i made sure nobody teaches her anything
p9464
aVnor did i teach her anything 
p9465
aVno one two three 
p9466
aVno a b c 
p9467
aVno  mary had a little lamb 
p9468
aVbecause i don t care whether mary had a lamb or not   you know 
p9469
aVpeople said   sadhguru  the way you are bringing up this girl 
p9470
aVshe won t know how many fingers she has 
p9471
aVi said   i don t care whether she knows how many fingers she has
p9472
aVas long as she knows how to use her fingers    
p9473
aVwhy should she know this is ten 
p9474
aVshe thinks this is hundred 
p9475
aVactually this used to happen 
p9476
aVwhen she was just
p9477
aVbecause i just exposed her to nature 
p9478
aVas much as possible  i expose
p9479
aVif there is nothing else  at least i took her up on the terrace
p9480
aVand showed her the stars  which you can t do in mumbai 
p9481
aVyou will show other kinds of stars in mumbai  
p9482
aVso  she would look up at the sky and say  
p9483
aVshe would call be by name  first name and say  
p9484
aV jaggi  ten 
p9485
aVten stars  tch 
p9486
aVbecause in her mind  the biggest number is ten 
p9487
aVsomewhere she heard ten  
p9488
aVso she didn t say million 
p9489
aVshe said ten 
p9490
aVi said   yes  ten 
p9491
aVwhat is the problem  whether ten stars or ten billion stars 
p9492
aVwhat is your problem 
p9493
aVyou think you are very knowledgeable because you know there are hundred billion galaxies 
p9494
aVin what way does it matter
p9495
aVwhether there are hundred billion or there are none 
p9496
aVwhat way does it matter 
p9497
aVbecause you are not seeing stars 
p9498
aVyou are only seeing the reflection in your mind  isn t it 
p9499
aVif you spend time to know the nature of what makes you experience all this
p9500
aVso  she asked me once something 
p9501
aVso i just told her just this 
p9502
aV this is all you need to know about life 
p9503
aVnever look up to anybody 
p9504
aVshe looked at me like this 
p9505
aVi said   not even me 
p9506
aVbecause the value of me will be completely lost the day you look up to me 
p9507
aVyou must look at me just as i am 
p9508
aVthen you will see immense value for who i am 
p9509
aVif you look up to me  you will miss everything
p9510
aVand one day you want to hang me on your wall 
p9511
aVas you did to everybody else  to rama  krishna  buddha  shiva  everybody 
p9512
aVyou hung them on your wall 
p9513
aVyou will hang me also on your wall 
p9514
aVyou will miss the entire value 
p9515
aVyou missed all those guys  now you ll miss me also 
p9516
aVyou must look at me just the way i am 
p9517
ag9504
aVnever look down on anybody  this is all  
p9518
aVonce you do not look up to anything or look down on anything 
p9519
aVyou will see everything just the way it is 
p9520
aVif you see everything just the way it is 
p9521
aVyou will navigate your life
p9522
aVthrough life effortlessly 
p9523
aV that s true 
p9524
aVthat is simple theory and easy enough to live by  
p9525
aVthank you  thank you sadhguru 
p9526
aVwith that  i think i would like to open the questions up to the house
p9527
aVand i am sure we have a volley of questions  which i can already see 
p9528
aVhands going up in the air 
p9529
aVi don t even know where to start  okay  yeah 
p9530
aV i ve worked hard for this  please 
p9531
ag8520
ag9531
aV you ve worked hard for this  okay  then i suppose hard work should never go unfounded 
p9532
aV hello 
p9533
aV is there a mike that is circulating  
p9534
aV okay  you can shout it 
p9535
aV yeah  if you have worked hard 
p9536
aVyou can scream loud  
p9537
aVyeah  there you go 
p9538
aV namaste sadhguru and hi karan johar 
p9539
aVi am thirty one 
p9540
aVi have kept myself single all my life  so that i could accomplish
p9541
aV no  no  you should go back there  it s  it doesn t come to me  the sound 
p9542
ag7920
aVmy name is rishabh  i am thirty one 
p9543
aVi ve kept myself single all my life  so i could accomplish  something big 
p9544
aVand you of all people should know how important and difficult it is 
p9545
aVimportant because to accomplish something big 
p9546
aVif you re single 
p9547
aVit helps without added responsibilities on your shoulders 
p9548
aVand difficult because
p9549
aV i know you are trying to speak from your heart
p9550
aVbut microphone works best here   
p9551
aV i just didn t want to be too loud  okay 
p9552
aVand difficult because  india 
p9553
aVthey keep asking you why you are still single 
p9554
aVi would like to space dive
p9555
aVand i have talked to a million people about this
p9556
aVand i have knocked on a hundred doors 
p9557
aVto turned down every single time
p9558
aVincluding the doors of isro  
p9559
aV i can t hear a thing 
p9560
aV including the doors of isro
p9561
aVand they said they don t have enough funds 
p9562
aV it s a very long question and we have not heard most of it 
p9563
aV i can t hear a thing actually 
p9564
aVi am feeling incap
p9565
ag7920
aV what is your question  sir 
p9566
aV okay  so my question is i would like to space dive
p9567
aV you would like to space 
p9568
aV space dive 
p9569
aVso it s basically going all the way up to space
p9570
aV you want to go to space 
p9571
ag9054
aV and diving from there 
p9572
ag9054
aV and tie what in space 
p9573
aV dive 
p9574
aV it s space dive 
p9575
aV oh  space dive 
p9576
ag8395
aV oh  you want to space dive 
p9577
ag8395
ag9054
aV so the thing is i have knocked on a hundred doors
p9578
aVonly to be turned down every single time
p9579
aVbecause even isro turned me down saying they don t have enough funds 
p9580
aVspace dive is important because
p9581
aVindia has gone leaps and bounds forward in space technology 
p9582
aVbut in the human space psychology it s way back 
p9583
aVmy question to you sadhguru is
p9584
aVmy biggest weakness is i like to live in danger 
p9585
aVmy question to you sadhguru is 
p9586
aVwhere do i find an organization that will help me with the discipline 
p9587
aVyoga and meditation that ll help me with this 
p9588
aV isha foundation

p9592
aVunderstand the importance of it 
p9593
aV hey  you

p9595
aVthat india needs a human space program 
p9596
aVfund it and make a movie out of it 
p9597
aVwhich has less drama 
p9598
aVless songs and more of how a person struggles to get the mission accomplished 
p9599
aVthank you very much 
p9600
aV okay  we got the question 
p9601

p9607
aVthat you were thirty one  
p9608
aVif i had money  the last thing i would do is give it to you to space dive  
p9609
aVthere s many things that i would do with that money

ag8542
aV  the boy is very serious 
p9621
aV yeah he is very serious about this  
p9622
aVi don't know  would you
p9623
aV so about you being single  
p9624
aVyou are sa
p9625
aVyou have saved one life  
p9626
aVand i want to tell you 
p9627
aVwhether you space dive  or you don t dive  or you nosedive  
p9628
aVall of us are born single and we die single 
p9629
aVtch  in between  what drama is  you do is up to you 
p9630
aVso you want to do a single act  or a double act  or a multiple act  it s up to you  
p9631
aVbut essentially  we are born single and we die single 
p9632
aVand if you want to space dive
p9633
aVthis is comic book stuff 
p9634
aVit means nothing 
p9635
aVdo not waste your life 
p9636
aVyou are a young man 
p9637
aVdon t waste your life thinking 
p9638
aV i want to space dive 
p9639
aVi want to do this and karan is going to fund it 
p9640
aVhe made is very clear 
p9641
aVhe has other ideas for his money and i am glad  
p9642
aV well  you get married  that s like space diving  
p9643
aVit s the same thing 
p9644
aVyou don t know where you are going  you are just diving  
p9645
aVyes  
p9646
aVthat s true 
p9647
aV namaskaram 
p9648
ag9648
aV when i told my teenage daughter about this program 
p9649
aVher immediate reaction was an excited wow 
p9650
aVshe is here with me and this program is everything we thought it would be 
p9651
aVquestion for you  karan  
p9652
aVwhat exactly inspired you to do this session with sadhguru 
p9653
aV whoa 
p9654
aV thank you ma am 
p9655
aV he did not say he is inspired  
p9656
aV i was 
p9657
aVand the lady definitely has it right 
p9658
aVit is because as i said somewhere that
p9659
aVthere are many questions that i constantly seek answers for 
p9660
aVi find myself in a dilemma between my emotions 
p9661
aVbetween my fears 
p9662
aVmy anxieties 
p9663
aVmy tussle internally between my letting go of religion
p9664
aVand holding on to what i understand of spirituality 
p9665
aVi haven t been able to seek too many answers through the books i have read
p9666
aVor the people i have heard 
p9667
aVto me  sadhguru has been a revelation in more ways than one
p9668
aVbecause he made many of my answers
p9669
aVthe answers that i was looking for resonate with my life 
p9670
aVand i think eventually  what we look for is deep resonance 
p9671
aVand anything that you attach yourself to  be  a spiritual energy 
p9672
aVa god perhaps 
p9673
aVa religion 
p9674
aVyou feel that you need to find answers within that resonance 
p9675
aVand i felt that my life resonated with everything that you said
p9676
aVand everything that you professed
p9677
aVand that s why i was very interested and excited to be part of this platform  
p9678
aVyes sir  i m sorry 
p9679
aVi was meant to go to you first 
p9680
aVbehind you  he s  sir 
p9681
aVi ll come back to you sir 
p9682
aVthe mike
p9683
ag9345
aVnamaskaram sadhguru 
p9684
aVhello karan 
p9685
aV hi 
p9686
aV there are two questions 
p9687
aVif the first one is answered  i don t need the second one s answer 
p9688
aVthis is a request  
p9689
aVcan i please get a hug from you  sadhguru  
p9690
aV hey  why don t you try him   
p9691
aV why am i a second in that line  
p9692
aV i didn t name the person 
p9693
aV what is your second question 
p9694
aVthe first is you want a hug  second is what 
p9695
aVyou can t
p9696
aVdon t go into a kiss then because  that might be detrimental 
p9697
ag8542
aVjust the presence of sadhguru for the first time in my life 
p9698
aVi just don t want to miss it 
p9699
aVi don't know when will i will get the chance next 
p9700
aVso if i could just 
p9701
aVi know it s a difficult one 
p9702
aV no  no  nothing difficult about it 
p9703
aVit is just that i have been working with people to make them understand
p9704
aVpeople  especially outside the country
p9705
aVand now unfortunately it s caught up here 
p9706
aV where is my hug  sadhguru 
p9707
aVcan i get my hug 
p9708
aVtch  you are turning something beautiful into something very ugly 
p9709
aVwhen you are in a certain state of inclusiveness 
p9710
aVif it became necessary  you embrace somebody 
p9711
aVit s a very beautiful act 
p9712
aVnow it s a commodity   where is my hug 
p9713
aVit s something  that you give and take 
p9714
aVit s not a transaction 
p9715
aVthis is what religion has done  
p9716
aVeverybody hugs three times  or four times  or whatever number of times 
p9717
aVthis is not what it is 
p9718
aVall the  the tenderness that a human being feels within himself or herself 
p9719
aVyou re destroying it and make it into some kind of act 
p9720
aVokay  i will hug you 
p9721
aVi ll hug every one of you 
p9722
aVwhat about it 
p9723
aVsweat exchange  
p9724
aVso  this is something we need to do 
p9725
aVand people also
p9726
aVin india  this happens 
p9727
aVthey grab my hand and 
p9728
aV sadhguru bless me  and they place it on their own head  
p9729
aVmy
p9730
aVblessing will not come like this 
p9731
aVblessing will come when you become receptive 
p9732
aVwhen you are in a certain way 
p9733
aVif it s blessed  something wonderful can happen out of it 
p9734
aVsomething tremendous can happen out of it 
p9735
aVyou grab my hand and   
p9736
aVwhat is that blessing 
p9737
aVand if you grab my hand or foot or you hug me forcefully 
p9738
aVthis is called molestation  
p9739
ag9070
aVyou got your jadu ki jhappi  
p9740
aVwe had  yes sir  yeah 
p9741
aV hello  namaskar sadhguru 
p9742
aVi know a hug is not possible but you cook very good dosa 
p9743
aVis that possible  
p9744
aV certainly not here  
p9745
aV i know 
p9746
aVno  my question is that when we cook 
p9747
aVif we have to get joy   \u000ajoy of cooking 
p9748
aVthen that joy is something which is internal and i cook for my joy 
p9749
aVbut when you are cooking for others  then you want to give them joy
p9750
aVand at times there is a conflict 
p9751
aVwho should win 
p9752
aV this is for him  
p9753
aV no sir 
p9754
aV no  no  it s for you only  
p9755
aVi have different things on my menu  
p9756
aV see  let us not make everything
p9757
aVthis is the most fundamental thing about being spiritual
p9758
aVor spiritual process means just this 
p9759
aVyou  essentially  spiritual process means just this 
p9760
aVthat you live here like only you exist 
p9761
ag8570
aVbecause you see everybody as yourself
p9762
aVand there is no issue 
p9763
aVpeople ask me 
p9764
aV sadhguru  wherever you go 
p9765
aVwhether it s 10000 people or 100000 people  how do you speak 
p9766
aV ah  well i am talking to them like i ve  if at i
p9767
aVif i had the habit   i don t have  
p9768
aVif i had the habit of talking in front of my mirror 
p9769
aVhow i would speak to myself 
p9770
aVthat s how i am speaking 
p9771
aVthere is no
p9772
aVyou  you  what i am doing is not some kind of oratory or discourse 
p9773
aVi am just talking like i would talk to myself
p9774
aVbecause i don t see anybody but myself 
p9775
aVso  spiritual process means just this 
p9776
aVthat in some way you became all inclusive  in your experience you became all inclusive 
p9777
aVso  one thing that has disappeared from your life is comparison and competition 
p9778
aVcomparison starts and then it transforms itself into competition
p9779
aVand then it goes into ugly things 
p9780
aVso even for something as alive and as beautiful as joy
p9781
aVjoy is 
p9782
aVjoy is the most important aspect of your life  you know 
p9783
aVthat is  joy means your experience of you being 
p9784
aVyour existence is fantastic 
p9785
aVyour experience of your existence has become beautiful 
p9786
aVthat s why you re joyful 
p9787
aVnow  i am not joyful because i make  
p9788
aVi make the best dosas  not you  okay   
p9789
aVnot because i make the best dosas 
p9790
aVnor will i be super joyful because i eat whatever the best things that you cook 
p9791
aVbefore i come into your restaurant  i ll be very joyful 
p9792
aVif you make something good  i will eat joyfully 
p9793
aVif you make something bad very joyfully i will push it aside 
p9794
aVbut with your good cooking or bad cooking  you can t steal my joy 
p9795
aVnor can you give my joy 
p9796
aVi want you also and everybody in the world become like this 
p9797
aVthat somebody else cannot determine
p9798
aVwhat happens within you  
p9799
ag8037
aV yes ma am 
p9800
aV  you are
p9801
aVyou are calling fundamental sense of slavery that you get into
p9802
aVwith beautiful names 
p9803
aVthis is dangerous 
p9804
aVso anyway  people are saying wonderful things about your cooking 
p9805
aVthey have not said anything about you 
p9806
aVbut they have said wonderful things about your cooking 
p9807
aVi would like to eat one day  
p9808
aVi don t know if i can afford it but 
p9809
ag9800
aVwe ll get a mike for you ma am 
p9810
aV namaste sadhguruji  my name is devika patel
p9811
aVand i d like to ask you a question because you re a mystic
p9812
aVand even otherwise 
p9813
aVplease don t say   i don t care 
p9814
aVbecause many people out here i m sure do 
p9815
aVmy question is  what do you think of reincarnation 
p9816
aVdo you believe in it and if so 
p9817
aVcan you elaborate on the subject
p9818
aVand let us know what you were in your last birth 
p9819
ag9064
aV now you ve already put strictures on me 
p9820
aVas to what i should not say 
p9821
aVfor me 
p9822
aVlast three lifetimes have been same work 
p9823
aVaround the same place
p9824
aVand a few people  handful of people  same people 
p9825
aVto such an extent
p9826
aVthat sometimes by mistake i end up calling them by old names 
p9827
aVbut you should not believe all this nonsense  
p9828
ag7832
aVbecause the moment you believe it 
p9829
aVyou will look at this person and little if they are friendly with you 
p9830
aV oh  maybe in my last life  
p9831
aVmy past life 
p9832
aVit is very good you don t remember a thing about anything
p9833
aVbecause in your present life 
p9834
aVyou are not able to handle the emotional tangles
p9835
aVand psychological involvements with people 
p9836
aVif you remember ten lifetimes 
p9837
aVyou would break your mind 
p9838
aVit takes an extraordinary sense of dispassion
p9839
aVto download many lifetimes of memory
p9840
aVand still not respond or react to those things
p9841
aVand simply see it for what it is 
p9842
aVin your present state  if such things happen 
p9843
aVit ll be a disaster 
p9844
aVbut anyway you should not believe these things
p9845
aVbecause you should not believe anything or anybody 
p9846
aVyou should not disbelieve them either 
p9847
aVnow  in such a large crowd
p9848
aVi have a huge reputation of being very logically correct
p9849
aVand now you re making me say such stupid things 
p9850
aVi m staking my reputation 
p9851
aVyou must understand that i wouldn t make that mistake 
p9852
aVbecause i don t gain anything by talking about this 
p9853
aVbecause you insisted that i should not dismiss it
p9854
aVbut essentially  what you re asking is  
p9855
aVlet me translate this question for you 
p9856
aVessentially what you re asking is  
p9857
aVwhen you say 
p9858
aV is there a past life or is there a future life 
p9859
aVwhat you re asking is 
p9860
aV beyond this body  is there something more 
p9861
aVthis is all you re asking 
p9862
aV after my death or before my birth  was there something else 
p9863
aVthis is the question  or you are asking 
p9864
aV what is the nature of my existence 
p9865
aVwell  that s my full time business 
p9866
aVto bring you to that experience as to what is the nature of your existence 
p9867
aVyou must come 
p9868
aVyou should not ask just a casual question here in mumbai and disappear 
p9869
aVnow you made me say illogical things in front of all these people 
p9870
aVnow you must invest some time to know what is the nature of your existence 
p9871
aVotherwise it s entertainment question  
p9872
aV i don t know  you have a color you like  
p9873
aVi don t know who to ask 
p9874
aV he is working hard but after him  i am afraid of hard working

aV when you get out of this hall  start walking south  
p9901
aVif it s a genuine question 
p9902
aVif it s a question which truly matters  you must seek 
p9903
aVi would have gone to the ends of the world 
p9904
aVif i found somebody  who could answer the billion questions i had 
p9905
aVif really it matters to you  the question  you must seek 
p9906
aVif you think going south is the answer 
p9907
aVif you don t think so  you shouldn t bother with me 
p9908
aVif you think so  you shouldn t waste a moment of your life
p9909
aVbecause i want everybody to at least be straight and in

p9930
aVand you are asking me  am i devoted to somebody

p9935
aVi am not against any of those things

p9937
aVall i am saying is you must have some integrity to your life 
p9938
aVwhen you ask a big question 
p9939
aVyou must make the investment  isn t it  of time and energy 
p9940
aVyou must invest life because to bloody answer this 
p9941
aVi ve invested my entire life  
p9942
ag9646
aV sadhguru  you had pointed out  there was
p9943
aVyes  to the lady right at the back 
p9944
aV that lady  please

p9947
aVwe re just going to the lady and then we ll get
p9948
aVwhere  who is that person 
p9949

aVhe is on  on it 
p9952
aV okay  you re on the mike  all right go ahead 
p9953
aV namaskaram sadhguruji  my question is 
p9954

p9955
aVto make it more blissful in this birth 
p9956
aV you got to change 
p9957
aV you have to 
p9958
aV you got to change  i said  
p9959
ag9957
aV there s nothing else  
p9960
aVyou think by doing something else  this  will become blissful 
p9961
ag7832
aVthis one  has to change to become blissful 
p9962
aV yes  the lady  has she got the mike 
p9963
aVyes  just reaching you ma am 
p9964
aV namaskar to one and all 
p9965
aVsir  my question is 
p9966
aVi get very attached easily
p9967
aVand now i feel i m very attached to my responsibilities 
p9968
aVso how do i break this bondage
p9969
aVand if i really want to do something for myself 
p9970
aVnot for anybody 
p9971
aVjust to feel the joy that i ve been listening to you 
p9972
aVif i want to really  really feel that joy 
p9973
aVhow do you i break the bondage of responsibilities
p9974
aVand move ahead
p9975
aVand how do i overcome my attachments 
p9976
aV oh   i want you to understand that
p9977
aVresponsibility is never a bondage 
p9978
aVresponsibility means you chose to respond to something wholeheartedly 
p9979
aVso it is never a bondage 
p9980
aVand how is it opposing your joy  i don t understand 
p9981
aVbecause to what extent you have the ability to respond 
p9982
aVonly to that extent you know life 
p9983
aVif you lose your ability to respond 
p9984
aVyou become dead 
p9985
aVin fact  somebody is dead means they ve lost all ability to respond  that s all it is 
p9986
aVso  don t ever think your responsibility is stopping you from being joyful 
p9987
aVif you had no responsibilities  
p9988
aVmany of you would be freaked to madness 
p9989
aVyou are fortunate you got something to dabble with 
p9990
aVnothing to do  i ll keep you in a room 
p9991
aVnothing to do  i ll feed you well 
p9992
aVyou ll go crazy 
p9993
aVyou must be glad there are distractions for your madness 
p9994
aVso  you must understand this 
p9995
aVif  if your experience of life is such that
p9996
aVif you sit here  you start enjoying your existence  
p9997
aVnot your thought 
p9998
aVnot your emotion 
p9999
aVnot your action 
p10000
aVyour existence if you start enjoying  
p10001
aVyou have a certain joy and blissfulness about your very existence 
p10002
aVthen all this jargon doesn t work 
p10003
aVif that one thing has not happened to you 
p10004
aVyou are in a desperate condition 
p10005
aVyou have to do a million things to know a little bit of pleasantness 
p10006
aVbut tell me sincerely 
p10007
aVgenuinely 
p10008
aVin a twenty four hour segment 
p10009
aVhow many moments of actual joy do you know 
p10010
aVmost people can count on their fingers 
p10011
aVmany people have nothing to count 
p10012
aVthey will say
p10013
aV oh  the day i got married  i was so happy 
p10014
aVthe day i got my job  i was so happy 
p10015
aVit happened  it s history 
p10016
aVbecause it is externally instigated 
p10017
aVotherwise by yourself you will become a wreck 
p10018
aVplease change this 
p10019
aVthen all these jargons and philosophies are irrelevant to you
p10020
aVbecause you know the joy of your existence 
p10021
aV thank you  
p10022
aVwe have one last question  yes sir 
p10023
aV hmm  haa  haa 
p10024
aVi m just going from this gentleman 
p10025
aVi ll come to you 
p10026
aVmaybe two
p10027
aVyes
p10028
aV sadhguru
p10029
aV i ll leave that to sadhguru 
p10030
aVafter this how many more he d like to answer   but yes 
p10031
aV sadhguruji namaskaram  karanji namaskaram 
p10032
ag9648
aV i m mohit saldana 
p10033
aVi ve come from karnal just to see you live and i m feeling blissfully blessed 
p10034
aVi didn t come with the question but now i have a question 
p10035
aVsadhguruji  you just made a mention that world does not know anything about you 
p10036
aVand that remains a fact 
p10037
aVeven then  any so body world who comes in little contact with you gets so much benefitted 
p10038
aVso when would you reveal 
p10039
aVor my question is  what does it take to become a arjuna for the yogi of highest order of our times 
p10040
aVour krishna  the you to reveal  
p10041
aVsorry if that question is still invalid 
p10042
aV this is
p10043
aVthis is difficult to articulate without sounding all wrong because
p10044
aVsee  everybody is working
p10045
aVor everybody is trying to live their life
p10046
aVwith different frames that they have created for themselves 
p10047
aVyou can call this mindsets 
p10048
aVyou can call this framework 
p10049
aVyou can call this family 
p10050
aVyou can call this society  you can call this ethics  morals  ideologies  whatever 
p10051
aVthese are all frameworks you created 
p10052
aVbut you understand 
p10053
aVa frame means you are putting a self imposed limitation upon yourself 
p10054
aVi can understand 
p10055
aVhe being a director producer 
p10056
aVhe s thinking of frames 
p10057
aVbecause he s thinking of capturing something for doing something else 
p10058
aVi m asking you a simple question 
p10059
aVdo you want to capture this life 
p10060
aVor do you want to experience this life 
p10061
ag8250
aV experience 
p10062
aV you want to experience this life  
p10063
aVyou re here to experience this life  and no other reason 
p10064
aVeverything else is secondary 
p10065
aVwhen i say life 
p10066
aVwhen i use the word life 
p10067
aVmost of you will think
p10068
aV oh  my work  family 
p10069
aVmy home  my car  my dog  that s not life 
p10070
aVthese are all accessories to life 
p10071
aVyou added all these accessories  believing that
p10072
aVwith these accessories  your life will get enhanced 
p10073
aVbut your money  your wealth  your family  your relationships 
p10074
aVthese are all just accessories  isn t it 
p10075
aVthe real thing is here  
p10076
aVnever experienced 
p10077
aVso  to first make somebody
p10078
aVi m  you know  there re many wonderful people around me 
p10079
aVthis is the biggest wealth i have 
p10080
aVi have some truly  absolutely fabulous people around me all the time 
p10081
aVthey won t let me pass through a single day
p10082
aVwithout tears of joy  love  ecstasy 
p10083
aVwithout witnessing this  a single day won t pass for me 
p10084
aVno matter which part of the world i am in 
p10085
aVi don t think there s better wealth in the world 
p10086
aVin the physical world  in the human societies  than that 
p10087
aVthat constantly you re surrounded by people 
p10088
aVwho are shedding tears of love and ecstasy 
p10089
aVhaving said that 
p10090
aVtheir experience might have become beautiful by being in a certain presence 
p10091
aVby realizing a few things 
p10092
aVbut still  they still have frameworks
p10093
aVbecause very few individuals have the sense of
p10094
aVa total sense of abandon to be here without framework 
p10095
aVas long as you re with the framework 
p10096
aVwe can add one drop here 
p10097
aVone drop there 
p10098
aVone more drop means it ll break 
p10099
aVso in my life 
p10100
aVif 
p10101
aVby the time i fall dead 
p10102
aVif i can share
p10103
aVmaybe one or two percentages of what i have known 
p10104
aVi think i m very fortunate 
p10105
aVbecause i m still looking 
p10106
aVi ve not given up on it 
p10107
aVthere can always be one or two individuals who ll come up 
p10108
aVwe have been working on them 
p10109
aVpreparing them 
p10110
aVso that somebody can exist here without any sense of frames 
p10111
aVwithout any sense of what will be lost 
p10112
aVthere are many people around me 
p10113
aVwho  you know 
p10114
aVin every action that they do  
p10115
aVthey re not saying it verbally  
p10116
aVin every action that they do 
p10117
aVthey show that they re willing to die for me 
p10118
aVi keep reminding them in a thousand ways 
p10119
aVdying for me is not the answer 
p10120
aVthat you are willing to allow this life  to happen in full flow 
p10121
aVthis is where the answer is 
p10122
aVbecause only if you re a full fledged life 
p10123
aVcan i share what s happening within me 
p10124
aVotherwise  i m talking about extending your frames 
p10125
aVgiving you a different frame which is more difficult to manipulate  
p10126
aVbut totally undoing the frames will need this 
p10127
aVthat you are a full fledged life 
p10128
aVwhen i say a full fledged life 
p10129
aVright now you have invested too much in your thought 
p10130
aVtoo much in your emotion 
p10131
aVyou look up to something 
p10132
aVyou look down on something 
p10133
aVyou like something 
p10134
aVyou dislike something 
p10135
aVin this state  it cannot be done 
p10136
aVi am working on people 
p10137
aVo lots of them 
p10138
aVand i m also scanning the world
p10139
aVbecause there could be s 
p10140
aVanybody somewhere 
p10141
aVbecause that will be a blessing 
p10142
aVnot to me  but to the world 
p10143
aVif  if there can be human beings  not one 
p10144
aVif there can be a thousand human beings on this planet 
p10145
aVor if can be 10000 human beings 
p10146
aVor a million human beings 
p10147
aVwho are just life 
p10148
aVno bull 
p10149
aVjust life 
p10150
aVbecause this is the only thing that you re aspiring for 
p10151
aVyou may think you want money 
p10152
aVyou may think you want pleasure 
p10153
aVyou may think you want something  
p10154
ag7832
aVyou are only wanting to  having a larger slice of life somehow  isn t it 
p10155
aVthat s all there is 
p10156
aVbecause that is all there is 
p10157
aVyou think money will get that 
p10158
aVeducation will get that 
p10159
aVlove will get that 
p10160
aVpleasure will get that 
p10161
aVbut essentially you want a larger slice of life 
p10162
aVso if you want in slices 
p10163
aVwe will cut it and serve it
p10164
aVbecause we have to keep you going 
p10165
aVotherwise you ll run away  
p10166
aVbut i want to see you 
p10167
aVa day when i can throw life at you just like that 
p10168
aVwithout making slices out of it 
p10169
aVthat would be a great day 
p10170
aVmake it happen  
p10171
aVbecause i want to change
p10172
aVi want to change the perception of what is street 
p10173
aVif you say street 
p10174
aVif you use the word street 
p10175
aVpeople will think booze 
p10176
aVpeople will think drugs 
p10177
aVpeople will think prostitution 
p10178
aVall the ugly things 
p10179
aVif we do the right things 
p10180
aVin the next twenty  twenty five years 
p10181
aVwe can change this 
p10182
aVthat street means beauty 
p10183
aVstreet means love 
p10184
aVstreet means meditativeness 
p10185
aVstreet means spiritual process 
p10186
aVstreet means the highest things 
p10187
aVwe can do this  if we are willing 
p10188
aVwe have the tools 
p10189
aVwe have the means 
p10190
aVwhy i m saying this is  never before
p10191
aVmany great beings have come 
p10192
aVbut nobody had the means that we have today 
p10193
aVa krishna came 
p10194
aVa gentle being  
p10195
aVwhen he spoke  only one man heard 
p10196
ag8713
aVand another man overheard  
p10197
aVwhen adiyogi shiva came 
p10198
aVonly seven people heard 
p10199
aVtoday we have the ability 
p10200
aVwe can sit here and speak to every human being on the planet 
p10201
aVnever before this was possible 
p10202
aVnow we have such an ability to communicate 
p10203
aVif we do not communicate the right things 
p10204
aVwe are committing a crime against humanity 
p10205
aVso when we have this kind of power to communicate 
p10206
aVwhatever is the highest dimension of life should become street 
p10207
aVi
p10208
aVmy essential work is this 
p10209
aVto bring down spirituality from mountaintops to street  
p10210
aVthat s why my language is little street  
p10211
aV not at all  with that 
p10212
aVi m sorry we won t be able to take any more questions 
p10213
aVwe ve reached the end of this conversation with the mystic
p10214
aVand thank you sadhguru 
p10215
aVthank you for your words  your wisdom

p10272
aS'what is your answer to tabelama'

p10275
aS'if you do not know something'
p10276
aS'if you realize you nano something'

p10300
aS'we put this put a tuprosss'
p10301
aS'or in other words'
p10302
aS'the basis of spirituality is a realization that i do not know'

aS'according to me sometimes'
p10380
aS'tusolnis the biggest disease that plagues humanity'
p10381
aS'a way of your own self'
p10382
aS'older there all kinds of idiots on the plane '
p10383
aS'yeah we well it many of them but'
p10384
aS'we must understand this'
p10385
aS'in the very nature of who we are it decide like this '

aS'do something stupid today '
p10387
aS'i yourintellientionbotheryouwhytididothist'

aS'well i have to say that you know i was a '

aS'i want to pestalizesalittlebuti was '
p10398
aS'prraeaboutthirtyminsable'
p10399
aS'and my father was verprtickeephi'
p10400
aS'and at that juncture of my life and before that'
p10401
aS'religion was organized in my life i was '
p10402
aS'i talked to me it was what '
p10403
aS'that the right thing to do was'
p10404
aS'am when he was in his last stage'
p10405
aS'the were things suggested to me '
p10406
aS'which were to me now completely ridiculous'
p10407
aS'into in going to a certain temple and feeding a cow of a certain color'
p10408
aS'and a you know and doing a certain ritual at all'
p10409
aS'and all those things that one did without even thinking'
p10410
aS'because as you said when you spoke about the its ondersplanet'
p10411
aS'i was definitely one of those in that state of my life'
p10412
aS'but sometimes you reach a critical stage '
p10413
aS'seek any kind of desperate measure '
p10414
aS'try to kind of hold on to any hope '
p10415
aS'even something that is advocated to that'
p10416
aS'who was against your green of intelligence or thought'
p10417
aS'to those people what is your advice'
p10418
aS'who have reached the end of their robena'
p10419
aS'in on and holding on to anything '

aS'so open'
p10422
aS'an unfounded esoladvice'
p10423
aS'so for all is set '
p10424
aS'emintlevases of these kind of aspeliions or actions '
p10425
aS'because people are just should scar of life'
p10426
aS'why is it so its a '

ag2415
aS'suppose you sat on a bicycle on stand and to'

aS'simply be lengforfunbut '
p10429
aS'came off the stamandsacarling'
p10430
aS'and it fast'
p10431
aS'the fear'
p10432
aS'very fast teter'
p10433
aS'the fundamental reason is '
p10434
aS'someone who knows how to ride a bicycle'
p10435
aS'fastertatgosthebetterthiis'
p10436
aS'but for someone who does not know how to ride a bicycle'
p10437
aS'the moment it moves tell will happen'
p10438
aS'so the fundamental thing is just this '

aS'it is a most basic institution in the making of a society '

aS"it's not a "

aS'it needs a a long desticionviteot before'
p10625
aS'a man becomes a man or a woman becomes a woman'
p10626
aS'there is a long fitdedwithve'
p10627
aS'the incibition of family is most important and '
p10628
aS'i did no question about that but '
p10629
aS'supposed to grow beyond that identity'
p10630
aS'but a whole lot of people just never grow beyond that did '

aS'the folowichothesaffa'
p10632
aS'and sometimes if there bonnincerdenplaces'

aS'they make the ndigonationsofa'

aS'you are supposed to grow out of that'

aS'as a child is most white that yoadidentiviedwith the family '
p10636
aS'another '
p10637

p10638
aS'because violitesthemostbasicientity'
p10639
aS'has to grow beyond that'
p10640
aS'so having said that'
p10641
aS'is it necessary that every father that every son has to have some kind of thanks'
p10642
aS'it is not about father and son'
p10643
aS'it is just old men being accommodated in the same home'
p10644
aS'any will at ten your father was godlike'
p10645
aS'so this problem started after you became '

aS'sixteen when you want to be a man and is not in a space'
p10647
aS'this big man is actemyingdometpice'
p10648

aS'space and was this'
p10650
aS'the konrectonightetodthehasfatherandsonbecause'
p10651
aS'now that i '
p10652
aS'it is no father then son '
p10653
aS'two men in the same house '
p10654
aS'is not in a space'
p10655
aS'this happens not just in human family'

p10661
aS'that the under one goes out or the older one goes up'
p10662
aS'this happens evlerav'
p10663
aS'because this is not a problem between pafatherlamsonetis '
p10664
aS'to men trying to share the same space'
p10665
aS'and the same woman called mother to one and wife to the other'
p10666
aS'to me'
p10667
aS'but that certainly breaks of a strong miss '
p10668
aS'dicountryeis operated with'
p10669
aS'because the problem was always meant to be two women in the same house and you '
p10670

aS'poblemlies the fact that two men gonbyunomedolia'

aS'its also the other thing that '

p11400
aS'love can also transfer itself into obsession'
p11401
aS'see '

aS'whatever is the most pleasant emotion within you '
p11429
aS'kepewil of bringing it on by yourself'

p11470
aS'simply because they are in a great love affair'
p11471

p11473
aS'now you in love with somebody here'
p11474
aS'that somebody may not even know that you love'
p11475
aS'but you can experience this as a '

aS'you dont need the support from the other person'
p11477
aS'this is an experience that s happening within you'
p11478
aS'love is within you if you '

p11513
aS'it s been caused from within '

aS'and once you understand this'
p11515
aS'why would you be walking on the street lovingly'
p11516
aS'why would you look at a tree lovingly'
p11517
aS'why would you look at a buffalo lovingly'
p11518
aS'why would do to e the cloud lovingly'
p11519
aS'because it is not something that i did '
p11520
aS'should i control it'
p11521
aS'why'
p11522
aS'with a good '
p11523
aS'this not at a danger'
p11524
aS'it doesnt get away '
p11525
aS'a almost everything that you experience'
p11526
aS'the more you exercise it the more edstaevilabletoyouwa'
p11527
aS'it s your love or joy or a or anger'
p11528
aS'the wall you exercised the moristavalibletwo'
p11529
aS"because it's aftralyouaremaking"
p11530
aS'it can tirdlyomyk'
p11531
aS'so when it you re making'
p11532
aS"why don't you enjoyed every moment of your "
p11533
aS'somebody s they re nobody s '
p11534
aS'and what is a problem '
p11535
aS'but the princito i think of the '
p11536
aS'the mother of of videos that legs a large part of humanity is expectation'
p11537
aS'i have a simple terlyithat i tried to expect less to a '
p11538
aS'so let me disappointed less '
p11539
aS'and i feel to cortearyourlexpectationas possibly the topesthing to do'
p11540
aS'because we constantly expect from relationships'
p11541
aS'from the work we do '
p11542
aS'ruydaiotielronger about this expectition'
p11543
aS'i have the highest expectation of every human being on the planet'
p11544
aS'and i know and i know they will disappoint me'
p11545
aS'i will die disappointed but joyfully disappointed'
p11546
aS'a asoitfldisaboointabeetisatlasteatserthatyouebincede '
p11547
aS'but that is not a the place to know on almostelasite'
p11548
aS'he these'
p11549
aS'things are not like that'
p11550
aS'to be joyful or miserable is essentially your choice'
p11551
aS"it s a choice that you're making within yourself"
p11552
aS'may be it an unconscious choice'
p11553
aS'anything that you do in costly'
p11554
aS'like now unconsciously my hand can fly'
p11555
aS'but what i can do unconsciously '
p11556
aS'i do the same thing definitely consciously also isn t it'
p11557
aS'this is the fundamental difference between being human and every other creature'
p11558
aS'we are not doing anything if and from what dedoing'
p11559
aS'the same things'
p11560
aS'reddoidlytlemoreconsciously '

aS'at the'
p11564
aS'these we leave '
p11565
aS'produseveliprousedtei'
p11566
aS'the '
p11567
aS'thing is we are doing it little more consciously'
p11568
aS'and then leave looked like another world by itself '
p11569
aS'tinkwiareabowdthowonl'
p11570
aS'because we can do the same silly little things little more consciously'
p11571
aS'so if i can not my hand and concseusl'
p11572
aS'i cannot a void consciously if i '
p11573
aS'and become joyful and conscious'
p11574
aS'i can also become joyful consciously'
p11575
aS'if i am joyful because of my choice'
p11576
aS'suppose disappointments are thrown at me'
p11577
aS'i will be joyfully disappointed '
p11578
aS'and my expectations of people are very very hot'
p11579
aS'i have an impossible epecision'
p11580
aS'so i am not ill die joyfully blissfully disappointed '
p11581
aS'because i know the native of the world where the '

p11621
aS'heres a need to constantly get more you know that what you have'
p11622
aS"there's no satisfaction and a place to stop"
p11623
aS'is that an end to need'
p11624
aS'no no they should'
p11625
aS'on'
p11626
aS'it is just that'
p11627
aS'now that you asking this question in '
p11628
aS'where you have realized that at every point of the '
p11629
aS'you thought this is it if this one thing happens and from filled'
p11630
aS'but the vitenexderyou realize this is not it this one motinginonemolting '
p11631
aS'you know that after ten years still the same state lontcentinso'
p11632
aS'means you are ready for you '
p11633
aS'this means you have a distorod that you re longing is not for more'
p11634
aS'your longing is for all you '
p11635
aS'in to expand is not just for more it is that a'
p11636
aS'on another word '
p11637
aS'your longing is in some way for infinite expansion'
p11638
aS'if you hamiyourdinfinlatexpanssion unconsciously'
p11639
aS'and if it finds a very basic physical expression'
p11640
aS'we called the sexueli'
p11641
aS'what you re trying to do is'
p11642
aS'something that is not you'
p11643
aS'with physical contact you are trying to make it a part of yourself'
p11644
aS"you know doesn't work"
p11645
aS'if you try emotionally we call this love'
p11646
aS'emotionally you trying to intmove something which is not you as a part of yourself'
p11647
aS'this is your lower fat'
p11648
aS'if you do it mentally this gets labeled as greed '
p11649
aS'is in conquest or here is simply shopping '
p11650
aS'if your good consciously then we call the you '
p11651
aS'you go in union'
p11652
aS'you re longing to expand in finightly'
p11653
aS'but because of little constipation in the head'
p11654
aS'you are going in in stomments'
p11655
aS'can you boiinstolemensandbecomeinfinelinteammas is a possible'
p11656
aS'can '
p11657
aS'one two three four and one day say infinity'
p11658
aS'no you will only become endless coming'
p11659
aS'so your longing is not for this much or that '
p11660
aS'your longing is for every'
p11661
aS'if you want everything you must understand that'
p11662
aS'you cannot do that physically'
p11663
aS'it when only happened in the diamonsen beyond physical'
p11664
aS'because physicality exists only because of defined but'
p11665
aS"but there is something within new which doesn't like this "
p11666
aS'which wants to stretch the '
p11667
aS'state the bat'
p11668
aS'states the bondaom'
p11669
aS'you are looking for boundlessness'
p11670
aS'but you are not cellaginincolitjis enough for conscious enough to admit '
p11671
aS'you want to borninstolments'
p11672
aS'now what you re looking is for boundlessness'
p11673
aS'if you want boundlessness'
p11674
aS'it can never ever happen to physical means'
p11675
aS"so one it doesn't happen to a physical"
p11676
aS'now you use the most connected word arldsspiitul'
p11677
aS'to the jewel does not mean looking up looking down '
p11678
aS'he s going there'
p11679
aS'it simply means your experience of life transcended the limitations of being just physical'
p11680
aS"because everything that s physical about you is an acquired qolity want isn't "
p11681
aS'this is just a piece of this land'
p11682
aS'what is a puriosasjustte heap of impressions of you gather'
p11683
aS'so what you have acquired can be or '
p11684
aS'can never be you'
p11685
aS'so this longing to have more'
p11686
aS'in more '
p11687
aS'the more '
p11688
aS'more something is not about those things'
p11689
aS'you are trying to find a dimension beyond physical nature'
p11690
aS'but because of constipation is not happening'
p11691

aS'only as long as the life that you are the mens in acedfor'
p11805
aS'that is it did not sprout and blossom'
p11806
ag10528
aS'then i delhi was expounding the science of you '

aS'then the seven sages who were with him'

aS'so he laughed and said you '
p11815
aS'cosmos i can pack it id you must tocceed'

aS'because your ideas of time and space and essentially because'
p11817
aS'living within the framework of your intellect'
p11818
aS'if you cross the bang'
p11819
aS'then there is no such thing as time and space'
p11820
aS'everything is here in a'

aS'i just come from a itecttateshavto six weeks '
p11830
aS'you can say maybe he was gita '
p11831
aS'so i said he was saying something silly'
p11832
aS'but i m fine'
p11833
aS'i am saying this because'
p11834
aS'you can fit the universe into your silly little logic '
p11835
aS'to this human being is too warwardly enamored with their own '
p11836
aS'to the missing the entire life'
p11837
aS'the gamut of phenomena that s happening in the existence is missed'
p11838
aS'because the only way you can axe anything '
p11839
aS'it has to fit into the square hole of your logic '
p11840
aS'and the thing that toeonteffitentyourmogecyewillegect'
p11841
aS'in this you resitethentarwassus'
p11842
aS'in this the rejected the magic of life'
p11843
aS'you have become a slave of logic'
p11844
aS'and completely missing the magic of life'

aS'in their understanding i sat there for many days or whatever'
p11863
aS'this idea of time and space is a very convoluted idea'
p11864
aS'simply before people are stuck in the framework of their logic'
p11865
aS'my work'
p11866
aS'my fundamental work is to take people'
p11867
aS'beyond the framework of logic into the true magic of existence'
p11868
aS'our own existence'

p11876
aS'what is the first thing you notice when you meet a bus'

aS'just everything'
p11878
aS'everything '
p11879

p11902
aS'i want to walk that line all the time '
p11903
aS'they are isterpring on it one we the '

aS'one thing so but people think'

p11907
aS'if there s no risk a anti'
p11908

aV thank you  
p12850
aV what a delight 
p12851
aVwhat a joy to have you here 
p12852
aVyou are among friends and it seems 
p12853
aVthat there are many who know of your work
p12854
aVand there are many who don t 
p12855
aV you are a highly educated man and i m 
p12856
aVbut i m devoid of education 
p12857
aVso you have to  
p12858
aV well  you know  as 
p12859
aV  make some allowances for me 
p12860
aV that s lovely of you to say 
p12861
aVi was so well educated 
p12862
aVi have rediscovered a joyful curiosity 
p12863
aVand while it is true i have many degrees after my name 
p12864
aVas i ve lost my hair and become more wrinkly  
p12865
aVi ve so enjoyed the spirit of joyful curiosity 
p12866
aVso in the spirit of hospitality 
p12867
aVin the spirit of joyful curiosity
p12868
aVand coming together across traditions 
p12869
aVi would love to hear your thoughts on a number of topics 
p12870
aVthe one that is near and dear to my heart 
p12871
aVas an educator
p12872
aVand as a physician and a pastor 
p12873
aVis this area of wellness and burnout 
p12874
aVphysicians today
p12875
aVa big study came out  
p12876
aVfifty four percent of physicians in america meet criteria for burnout 
p12877
aVand nurses are in the same boat 
p12878
aVand you re here at a medical school
p12879
aVand we re looking for answers
p12880
aVand we re looking for hope 
p12881
aVand so  to those fifty four percent of physicians who are burned out 
p12882
aVand the nurses and pas and nurse practitioners 
p12883
aVall of us in healthcare 
p12884
aVwhat would you say to them 
p12885
aV if we have to bring health 
p12886
aVeither to ourselves or to others 
p12887
aVone fundamental thing is 
p12888
aVyou bring a very profound sense of wholeness into you  
p12889
aVthe various dimensions of life that we are 
p12890
aVall of it is in sync and functioning well 
p12891
aVit s sad to hear that
p12892
aVphysicians are in a state of burnout 
p12893
aVhow would they cause health 
p12894
aVthey could sell more medicine 
p12895
aVbut they cannot cause health if they are in a state of burnout 
p12896
aVnow we re seeing  as modern medicine progresses 
p12897
aVcomes out with miracle after miracle 
p12898
aVresearch  all kinds of things 
p12899
aVbut people are not getting healthy 
p12900
aVmore people are getting sick than ever before 
p12901
aVa country like united states 
p12902
aVwhich is the most affluent country on the planet 
p12903
aVwhich essentially means you have a choice of nourishments 
p12904
aVevery human being has a choice of nourishment 
p12905
aVmost of the ailment that you see in other parts of the world
p12906
aVare nourishment related in some way
p12907
aVbecause the needed nourishment is not there at the right time
p12908
aVfor a whole lot of people on this planet 
p12909
aVbut in a country where there is a choice of nourishment  
p12910
aVi would say an excessive choice of nourishment  
p12911
aVa nation is spending three trillion dollars on healthcare 
p12912
aVthis is bigger than the budgets of major nations in the world 
p12913
aVindia s economy is around three trillion dollars 
p12914
aVyou re spending that much on healthcare of a quarter million people 
p12915
aVthis shows somewhere we have missed health 
p12916
aVmaybe we have an industry going but we have missed health 
p12917
aVwell  we can explain it in so many ways
p12918
aVbut doctors being under burnout
p12919
aVeverybody thinks their profession is the most difficult one 
p12920
aVif  if any individual human being is creating something that they really care for 
p12921
aVthere would be never any kind of burnout 
p12922
aVmyself and a whole lot of people around me 
p12923
aVwe are seven days of the week 
p12924
aVtwenty hours a day  three hundred and sixty five days 
p12925
aVthis s our schedule 
p12926
aVyou will not see me burned out 
p12927
aVmaybe sometimes i ll get physically exhausted 
p12928
aVmaybe i ll die of exhaustion one day 
p12929
aVbut definitely not of burnout or boredom 
p12930
aVthose two things will never happen to me 
p12931
aVwhy i m saying this is 
p12932
aVthe fundamental reason why this is happening is  
p12933
aVparticularly the physicians because
p12934
aVthere re various kinds of professions 
p12935
aVbut particularly when people go to a doctor 
p12936
aVin some way they re placing their life in his hands 
p12937
aVso when somebody is willing to place their life in your hands 
p12938
aVyou must treat it as a sacred duty 
p12939
aVit s not just a job 
p12940
aVit s not just a business 
p12941
aVit is a 
p12942
aVwhen somebody is willing to place their life in your hands
p12943
aVi m telling you  even people who live with you 
p12944
aVyour own wife and children or husband  is not willing to place their life in your hands completely
p12945
aV 
p12946
aVbut somebody  an unknown person comes and places his life in your hands 
p12947
aVi think it s a greatest privilege that somebody trusts you at that level 
p12948
aVthat they re willing to trust you with life 
p12949
aVyou could do right things or wrong things 
p12950
aVknowingly or unknowingly 
p12951
aVbecause nobody has figured the human body absolutely  all right 
p12952
aVwe know it to some extent 
p12953
aVso you may do any number of wrong things 
p12954
aVbut they placed their life into your hands 
p12955
aVi think
p12956
aVtraditionally  it was said like this in india 
p12957
aV in any given society 
p12958
aVif education 
p12959
aVmedicine
p12960
aVand spiritual process 
p12961
aVif it gets commercialized 
p12962
aVthat society will go down the drain 
p12963
aVi think we re doing this to the entire modern world 
p12964
aVall three are becoming commercialized 
p12965
aVthere s nothing wrong with commerce 
p12966
aVcommerce is a 
p12967
aVa transaction of give and take 
p12968
aVyou give me this  i ll give you that 
p12969
aVbut there are some things  which cannot be handled as just give and take 
p12970
aVif you bring this aspect of transaction into spiritual process 
p12971
aVinto education
p12972
aVand into medicine 
p12973
aVthen it turns ugly 
p12974
aVand that ugliness will definitely burn you out one way or the other 
p12975
aVabove all  what people are experiencing as burnout is  
p12976
aVfirst of all  they re doing something that they don t care for 
p12977
aVif they were genuinely doing something that they truly care for 
p12978
aVthere would be no burnout 
p12979
aVthe more opportunity you get to do it 
p12980
aVthe better it would be  isn t it 
p12981
aVeverything is towards a certain end 
p12982
aVthe joy of doing what you re doing is not there in one s life 
p12983
aVthis is not just for any one profession  it s for all professions 
p12984
aVbut particularly in a profession like this 
p12985
aVwhere it s a question of life and death for somebody else 
p12986
aVwhen it s a question of life and death for the person who is sitting in front of you 
p12987
aVit can't be a transaction for you 
p12988
aVwell  there is a business end to everything
p12989
aVbecause to make anything sustainable 
p12990
aVthere has to be a business end to it 
p12991
aVwe are not against the business end of it 
p12992
aVbut within yourself 
p12993
aVif you don t do it as a great offering to the person who is sitting in front of you  
p12994
aVof course  they will pay their fee 
p12995
aVbut within yourself  if you are not like this  
p12996
aVdefinitely you will burnout doing this kind of work 
p12997
aVotherwise  every day if you helped a person 
p12998
aVif in some way you made somebody s life 
p12999
aVtheir life better 
p13000
aVby the end of the day  should you be ballooned into a joyful state 
p13001
aVor should be in a state of burnout at the end of the day 
p13002
aVit should not be a burnout
p13003
aVif you genuinely experienced you have enhanced many lives around you 
p13004
aVthis is not about service 
p13005
aVthis is not about ideas of  i served this  i did this   
p13006
aVno 
p13007
aVthere is a joy within a human being
p13008
aVwhen they re able to touch another life 
p13009
aVwhy you are holding a few people dear to you as family is
p13010
aVbecause you believe you can touch their life in some way 
p13011
aVyou can make a difference 
p13012
aVthat is what is most important for a human being 
p13013
aVin every activity that we perform 
p13014
aVwhatever the nature of the activity 
p13015
aVhow profoundly we can touch someone else 
p13016
aVthis is what makes the big difference 
p13017
aVif you make a movie 
p13018
aVyou don t want to make a movie which nobody wants to watch  would you 
p13019
aVyou want people to watch this movie and come to tears  isn t it 
p13020
aVyou don t want to build a house that nobody wants to live in 
p13021
aVyou don t want to cook something that nobody wants to eat 
p13022
aVthese things you can do only because
p13023
aVin some way you are able to touch another life through your activity 
p13024
aVthis is most fundamental need within the human being 
p13025
aVand as a physician 
p13026
aVyou have a phenomenal opportunity of touching lives like very other 
p13027
aVvery few other professions can do 
p13028
aVand this should not lead to burnout
p13029
aVbut this is happening so because
p13030
aVwe re trying to treat it like a transaction 
p13031
aVand the most fundamental thing that we have not understood in this process is
p13032
aVthat human experience is caused from within 
p13033
aVnot from outside 
p13034
aVyour joy and misery 
p13035
aVyour pain and pleasure 
p13036
aVyour agony and ecstasy 
p13037
aVeven light and darkness right now is happening only within you 
p13038
aVit never happens around you 
p13039
aVwhat happens within you 
p13040
aVif you try to fix it by fixing what is around you 
p13041
aVyou will go bonkers in no time 
p13042
aVi am surprised why only fifty four percent  
p13043
aVbecause if you don t understand human experience is caused from within
p13044
aVespecially medical professionals 
p13045
aVwho in some way have delved into the nature of human physiology
p13046
aVand i believe to some extent the mind 
p13047
aVwe must know that every aspect of human experience comes from within 
p13048
aVand today 
p13049
aVmodern medicine especially 
p13050
aVunlike the traditional medicine 
p13051
aVis entirely chemical fixes for everything 
p13052
aVso you understand that both health and illness is happening because of chemistry 
p13053
aVjoy and misery is a certain chemistry 
p13054
aVdifferent types of chemistry 
p13055
aVecstasy and agony are different types of chemistry 
p13056
aVor in other words  we are a chemical soup 
p13057
aVthe question is only 
p13058
aVare you a great soup or a lousy soup  
p13059
aVnow if i give soup making ingredients to all of you 
p13060
aVdo you believe all of you will come with the same kind of soup 
p13061
aVhmm 
p13062
aVyou will come with hundred different varieties of soups 
p13063
aVso there is something called as the skill of soup making 
p13064
aVall of us have come with the same fundamental ingredients of life 
p13065
aVsee in how many ways we have become 
p13066
aVand only fifty four percent are getting burnt out 
p13067
aVhandling life so wrong 
p13068
aVhundred percent should be burnt out 
p13069
aV so let s talk about making soup  
p13070
aV so 
p13071
aV no  don t go into this area  i m a very good cook  
p13072
aV okay  we ll talk
p13073
aVso  this soup of life  if you will
p13074
aVso  you know  tonight 
p13075
aVthere is a nurse or a physician  who has come home
p13076
aVand they told a family member that their loved one just died 
p13077
aVor they treated a child who s undergoing chemotherapy 
p13078
aVor they were in a clinic
p13079
aVwhere they re taking care of someone who doesn t have enough insurance to cover that medication 
p13080
aVand so those good folks have come home
p13081
aVand their spirits are broken 
p13082
aVand they love what they do 
p13083
aVi think burned out physicians love what they do  
p13084
aVthey do 
p13085
aVand i like that metaphor of soup making 
p13086
aVwhat can we do 
p13087
aVand so what can we do  
p13088
aVwhat can that nurse  that physician assistant  that doc 
p13089
aVwhat 
p13090
aVsaturday morning comes around  they wake up  what should they do 
p13091
aV i  i can teach you a way of making your chemistry into a blissful chemistry 
p13092
aVthat means you re blissful by your own nature 
p13093
aVnot because of something that happened around you 
p13094
aVthis is exactly what i m saying 
p13095
aVwhat this question implies is 
p13096
aVwhat happens around you determines what happens within you 
p13097
aVthe significance of being human is this 
p13098
aVthat 
p13099
aV what happens within me  i can create around me 
p13100
aVif what happens around me makes me 
p13101
aVi am still in animal nature 
p13102
aVa human being means 
p13103
aV i do all the same things that the animal does
p13104
aVbut i can do all of it consciously 
p13105
aVthat is the big part of being human 
p13106
aVwell  you are born like any other creature 
p13107
aVyou grow up  you eat  you sleep  maybe you reproduce and you die one day 
p13108
aVthis is what every creature does 
p13109
aVthis is what you and me do 
p13110
aVbut we can do it consciously 
p13111
aVwhich includes your thought  your emotion  everything 
p13112
aVto put this very simply 
p13113
aVit amazes me that people are twenty  thirty  fifty  sixty years of age 
p13114
aVthey still do not know how to handle their thought
p13115
aVand how to handle their emotion 
p13116
aVthis is a huge disability in the world  
p13117
aVif you don t know how to use your hands 
p13118
aVwould you call that a disability 
p13119
aVif you don t know how to manage your thought 
p13120
aVhow to manage your emotion 
p13121
aVis it not a disability 
p13122
aVjust because everybody is in the same condition 
p13123
aVit does not become normal  
p13124
aVso  essentially 
p13125
aVyou are 
p13126
aVyou have made a choice of dealing with people 
p13127
aVwho are sick or dying 
p13128
aVit is a choice 
p13129
aVand it is a privilege that those who are unwell  
p13130
aVbeing unwell means
p13131
aVyou are no more hundred percent on your feet 
p13132
aVyou need somebody s help  
p13133
aVsuch people
p13134
aVand those who are dying in some way 
p13135
aVthey re willing to trust you and put their life into your hands 
p13136
aVit s a great privilege 
p13137
aVwell  in this 
p13138
aVthere are many things to do 
p13139
aVas you gave examples 
p13140
aVthat you have to convey something unpleasant to somebody 
p13141
aVsometimes you are not able to treat them
p13142
aVbecause either you have no time 
p13143
aVor they have no money or whatever 
p13144
aVthese are there 
p13145
aVi m not questioning this 
p13146
aVbut the most important aspect of this is 
p13147
aVif you want to bring well being to somebody 
p13148
aVyou must know how to be well  isn t it 
p13149
aVotherwise  how would you do it  i m asking 
p13150
aVhow 
p13151
aVhow would you create well being to someone
p13152
aVwhen you do not know how to be well 
p13153
aVwhat this implies is 
p13154
aV if i have to be well  the world has to be perfect 
p13155
aVwell  you re not going to be well  
p13156
aVbecause even if you re just two people in the family 
p13157
aVnot everything happens the way you think it should happen  isn t it 
p13158
aVhello 
p13159
aVyou can tell me  it s okay  
p13160
aVeven if you re just two people 
p13161
aVnot everything will ever happen to you hundred percent the way you want it 
p13162
aVfifty one percent if it s happening your way 
p13163
aVyou have the controlling stake  
p13164
aVanything more if you expect  you ll have a divorce  
p13165
aVyes 
p13166
aVso  outside will never happen hundred percent the way you want it 
p13167
aVor in other words 
p13168
aVif you expect the outside to be hundred percent the way you want it 
p13169
aVyou re just not equipped to live here in this world 
p13170
aVyes or no 
p13171
aVif you re expecting the external situations to go hundred percent my way 
p13172
aVobviously i m not equipped to live in this world 
p13173
aVyou know we are a volunteer organization 
p13174
aVover 4000 full time volunteers 
p13175
aVover three million part time volunteers 
p13176
aVevery day somebody is coming up to me and saying 
p13177
aV sadhguru  i can t take her anymore  i can't take it 
p13178
aVthis person  i can t work with this person 
p13179
aVthis man is like this  this woman is like that 
p13180
aVi tell them 
p13181
aV see  this is the kind of people that exist in the world 
p13182
aVif you think what you re doing is very significant 
p13183
aVyou ve got to work with these people 
p13184
aVhowever they are 
p13185
aVif you want to work with ideal people 
p13186
aVyou must go to heaven  and today   
p13187
aVthese are our realities 
p13188
aVif you truly see  genuinely see that
p13189
aV what i m doing is significant 
p13190
aVit s of significant 
p13191
aVit s significant enough to make difference in lives around me 
p13192
aVnow you have to do that work 
p13193
aVthe problem is not of the nature of your work 
p13194
aVyou just ask anybody  from the topmost job down to the most menial job 
p13195
aVeverybody complains about stress 
p13196
aVso stress is not about your job 
p13197
aVi must tell you this 
p13198
aVa few years ago  many years ago 
p13199
aVwhen i first came to united states 
p13200
aVwherever i went  people were talking about stress management 
p13201
aVi couldn t understand this
p13202
aVbecause in my understanding 
p13203
aVwe manage whatever is precious to us 
p13204
aVour family  our wealth  our business  our money 
p13205
aVwhy would anybody want to manage stress  
p13206
aVit took me a while to understand 
p13207
aVpeople have concluded that stress is a part of their life 
p13208
aVstress is not a part of your life 
p13209
aVit s just your inability to manage your own thought 
p13210
aVyour own emotion  your own energies and your own body 
p13211
aVif you knew 
p13212
aVif your mind took instructions from you 
p13213
aVwould you live in stress or in bliss 
p13214
aVplease tell me 
p13215
aV bliss 
p13216
aV what s your choice 
p13217
ag13166
aVsuch a simple thing is not happening because
p13218
aVyour mind is not even taking instructions from you 
p13219
aVif your intelligence turns against you  who the hell can save you  
p13220
aVso this anxiety  this stress is not about the job 
p13221
aVit is just that
p13222
aVour education systems are such 
p13223
aVthey are telling you how to conquer the world  you know 
p13224
aVhow to break an invisible atom 
p13225
aVhow to go beyond space 
p13226
aVbut they re not telling you a thing about this one  
p13227
aVthis  is the most complex  
p13228
aVif you want to call it a human mechanism  
p13229
aVthis  is the most complex and sophisticated mechanism you have seen 
p13230
ag13166
aV yes 
p13231
aV as a doctor  you know 
p13232
aVbut i m asking 
p13233
aVeven the doctors 
p13234
aVhave they read the user s manual  
p13235
aVhow to use this  
p13236
ag13007
aVjust by accident  something 
p13237
aVwhen you live by accident 
p13238
aVanxiety is natural 
p13239
aV so i was really interested in the title of your book  
p13240
aVinner engineering   
p13241
aVa yogi s guide to joy 
p13242
aVand those are some words that you don t usually see often so close together 
p13243
aVi m thinking about engineering 
p13244
aV and joy  
p13245
aV  and joy 
p13246
aV  and a yogi  and a yogi  
p13247
aV and a yogi  right 
p13248
aVengineering  yogi  you know 
p13249
aVand i like that word engineering 
p13250
aVyou need to know  there are some really 
p13251
aVsome of the top engineers at the university are in the audience tonight 
p13252
aV yesterday was the engineer s 
p13253
aV they re right there 
p13254
aV yesterday was the world engineer s day  
p13255
aV yeah  so what s the 
p13256
aVwhat s the theme of 
p13257
aVwhat would you say is the message of this 
p13258
aVi mean  i think you re getting at that 
p13259
ag13241
ag13242
aVwhat does that mean 
p13260
aV see  if you 
p13261
aVif you and me were here let s say a hundred years ago
p13262
aVor two hundred years ago 
p13263
aVhow the world was and how it is today 
p13264
aVit is almost another world 
p13265
aVit s not the same world 
p13266
aVyou wouldn t have recognized it  that s how much it has changed 
p13267
aVwhat changed this 
p13268
aVour ability to engineer external situations the way we want it 
p13269
aVwe could sit outside and do this
p13270
aVbut now we re sitting in this building because this is engineered for our comfort 
p13271
aVnow  engineering essentially means
p13272
aVmaking something just the way we want it 
p13273
aVwe made everything in the world the way we want it 
p13274
aVbut now fifty four percent burnout 
p13275
aVbecause we did not make this one thing  the way we want it 
p13276
aVif we made this one thing  the way we want it 
p13277
aVagain the same question  
p13278
aVwould you live blissfully or miserably 
p13279
aVif you made this  the way you want it 
p13280
aVyou would definitely make this blissful 
p13281
aVhighest level of pleasantness for yourself 
p13282
aVwhat you want for your neighbor may be debatable 
p13283
aVbut what you want for yourself is very clear  isn t it 
p13284
aVso  this is not happening because
p13285
aVwe have never approached inner well being in a scientific manner 
p13286
aVwe are thinking something else from somewhere is going to fix this 
p13287
aVif we want to be well  we looked up 
p13288
aVin india  they call this uparwala 
p13289
aVthat means the one above 
p13290
aVi m saying 
p13291
aVis it true that you are living on a round planet 
p13292
ag13159
aVis it a round planet that we are living on 
p13293
aV and on top of it  it s spinning 
p13294
aVif you look up  you re invariably looking up in the wrong direction  isn t it  
p13295
aVi m 
p13296
aVyou must go to australia  to look up the right way 
p13297
aVso i m saying we are simply even incapable of knowing what is up and down in this universe 
p13298
aVis it somewhere marked in this cosmos  
p13299
aVthis side up  
p13300
aVwe not only do not know  we cannot know  isn t it 
p13301
aVso we don t even know which is up  which is down 
p13302
aVwe do not know what is forward  what is backward 
p13303
aVwe really do not know what is east  what is west 
p13304
aVfor convenience  we made up things 
p13305
aVbut there is one thing that you can know  right now 
p13306
aVthere is a perspective 
p13307
aVthere is inward and there is outward 
p13308
aVwe have been just busy fixing the outside 
p13309
aVyou fix the outside as much as you want 
p13310
aVall you will get is comfort and convenience 
p13311
aVyou will not get well being 
p13312
aVif well being has to happen 
p13313
aVyou have to engineer your interiority the way you want it 
p13314
aVonly when this  becomes the way you want 
p13315
aVnow this will be joyful 
p13316
aV if outside becomes the way i want  there will be comfort 
p13317
aVyou have to admit this  
p13318
aVnever before in the history of humanity 
p13319
aVany other generation knew the kind of comforts and convenience
p13320
aVthat you and me are enjoying right now 
p13321
ag13171
ag13062
ag13231
aV we are the most comfortable generation ever 
p13322
aVbut we are whining like crazy  
p13323
aV let s talk about the inner life and the outer life 
p13324
aVone thing that strikes me as so powerful about your mission in the world is
p13325
aVthat you seem to successfully broker both of those worlds 
p13326
aV oh  bro  you must take off the word broker  
p13327
aV i guess 
p13328
aVhow to say 
p13329
aVyou successfully pursue both of those worlds 
p13330
aVif you will 
p13331
aVthe isha foundation educates the young and plants trees 
p13332
aVand then you also teach people about inner engineering 
p13333
aVand i think that could be a challenge for
p13334
aV we  in the west 
p13335
aVwe in the west perhaps love the outer world
p13336
aVand maybe at the expense of the inner world 
p13337
aVbut i d love to hear your perspective on that 
p13338
aV see all these massive projects of health 
p13339
aVeducation and ecology that we re doing in southern india
p13340
aVhave mainly happened only because of an inner experience 
p13341
aVthere re millions of people who had a powerful inner experience 
p13342
aVit s out of that we are able to generate this action 
p13343
aVbecause these massive projects are all completely done by a volunteer force 
p13344
aVvolunteers means 
p13345
aVnobody s trained for the job  
p13346
aVand 
p13347
aVand you cannot fire them for inefficiency  because they re volunteers  
p13348
aVat the same time 
p13349
aVeven if they re holding a key position 
p13350
aVat any time without notice they can just vanish  
p13351
aVyou manage an organization like this  you will go crazy in no time 
p13352
aVthat s my job  
p13353
aVso  having described my job 
p13354
aVwhich is a sure route to madness  
p13355
aVif i was not as well established as i am within myself 
p13356
aVit would have driven me bonkers 
p13357
aVbecause i ve managed businesses before
p13358
aVand at that time 
p13359
aVi used to wield my authority on people to get things going 
p13360
aVand the main thing was  they were on my
p13361
aVyou know 
p13362
aVi was doing the payment for them 
p13363
aVthat was the main control 
p13364
aVnow i don t make any payment for anybody 
p13365
aVeverybody is not paid 
p13366
aVnobody is paid 
p13367
aVin fact  they spend their own money and come and do everything 
p13368
aVto keep them going is essentially the inner engineering 
p13369
aVbecause there is a powerful experience within 
p13370
aVwhich drives them to do all this work 
p13371
aVit is 
p13372
aVit is unfortunate that people always trying to divide the world 
p13373
aVyou must understand this 
p13374
aVthat the very basic nature of human intellect is this
p13375
aVhuman intellect   you know  all of you  
p13376
aVthe sharper it is  the better it is  isn t it so 
p13377
aVyou should agree with me  
p13378
aVthe sharper it is  the better it is  i think  intellect 
p13379
aV i actually wanna talk about being a prophet 
p13380
aV hey  don t go that far  let s finish the project  
p13381
aV let s go there 
p13382
aVso  because one of the things about sort of
p13383
aVbe mindful of the inner life 
p13384
aV mhmm  
p13385
aVyou cannot be mindful of the inner life 
p13386
aVnow you talked about being a prophet 
p13387
aVnow i can say no  
p13388
aV so i don't think 
p13389
aVi wouldn t say you re a prophet 
p13390
aVi m talking about the judeo christian tradition of prophecy 
p13391
aV oh 
p13392
aV  so in the hebrew bible  in the old testament 
p13393
aVthere is the role of those who speak truth to power 
p13394
aVwho speak out against injustice 
p13395
aVwho sacrifice themselves for a cause because of injustice 
p13396
aVand there in that narrative 
p13397
aVthere is anger and there is rage 
p13398
aVand there are significant groups of people in the world 
p13399
aVin our country 
p13400
aVwho have due cause to be angry about the world  
p13401
aVthe refugee 
p13402
aVthe ethnic minority 
p13403
aVthe poor 
p13404
aVand one thing about inner engineering
p13405
aVand sort of finding peace within oneself 
p13406
aVthe other side of that coin is 
p13407
aVyou know what 
p13408
aVis there ever a time to be angry 
p13409
aVto march 
p13410
aVto be enraged at the injustice of the world 
p13411
aVwhat would you say to that 
p13412
aV you know che  i know you 
p13413
aVthis is not a popular name in america 
p13414
aVche guevara said   if you are in rage  you are one of us 
p13415
aVi said   if you are out of rage  you re one of us   
p13416
aVif you re really out of rage 
p13417
aVyou re definitely one of us 
p13418
aVbecause you think there is a reason for your anger 
p13419
aVwhich is a wrong perception 
p13420
aVif you look at it 
p13421
aVpeople get terribly angry with their loved ones 
p13422
aVthere s a whole lot violence within the homes
p13423
aVbecause they get terribly angry with their loved ones 
p13424
aVsomebody that they re living with 
p13425
aVand they have a good reason to get angry 
p13426
aVbecause she did not cook the breakfast properly 
p13427
aVor the dog peed where it s not supposed to pee 
p13428
aVor i have seen people yelling and screaming and breaking their clubs on a golf course 
p13429
aVwhere they re just having a good time  
p13430
aVso i m saying everybody has a reason to be angry 
p13431
aVanger means just this 
p13432
aVwhen you re angry
p13433
aVas a doctor  you know today that when you re angry 
p13434
aVliterally you re generating poison in the system  
p13435
aVliterally 
p13436
aVif you are poisoning yourself internally
p13437
aVand when you re angry 
p13438
aVyou know you do the most idiotic things in your life 
p13439
aVwhen you turn back and see  you can t believe you did it 
p13440
aVbut most idiotic things happen when you re angry 
p13441
aVso i m asking 
p13442
aVis it 
p13443
aVis anger an intelligent expression of human life
p13444
aVor an idiotic expression of human life 
p13445
ag13159
aVidiotic 
p13446
aVso that s all you need to know  
p13447
aVthe next time you re angry  you just know you re stupid 
p13448
aVbecause you re turning against yourself 
p13449
ag13071
aV but  i will tell you 
p13450
aVthe reason why this anger has been eulogized is 
p13451
aVin a moment of anger 
p13452
aVsome people who were sleeping all their life propelled themselves into action
p13453
aVand that action produced some results 
p13454
aVyes  that can happen 
p13455
aVit may so happen  you know 
p13456
aVthat if i throw a stone at you 
p13457
aVinstead of hitting you 
p13458
aVit hit the apple in the tree and the apple fell into your hands 
p13459
aVbut that s by accident 
p13460
aVgenerally  if i throw a stone 
p13461
aVyour head will crack 
p13462
aVthat s what is supposed to happen 
p13463
ag13166
aVso i got angry and something got done 
p13464
aVso i think anger is a great way of doing things 
p13465
aVso when you re angry  you yell and fume at somebody 
p13466
aVi m asking all of you 
p13467
aVhow many of you enjoy being yelled at and fumed by somebody else 
p13468
aVwhether it s your boss 
p13469
aVor your husband 
p13470
aVor your wife 
p13471
aVor your parents or anybody 
p13472
aVyou really thoroughly enjoyed this  
p13473
ag13159
aVdid you 
p13474
aV no 
p13475
ag13475
aVand what makes you think somebody else enjoys it 
p13476
aVthey endure you 
p13477
aVthey don t enjoy you 
p13478
aVand when they re done  they re done  
p13479
aVso  it doesn t matter
p13480
aVwhether the anger happened to a man that you call as a prophet 
p13481
aVbecause we have a way of eulogizing everything
p13482
aVwhich 
p13483
aVwith which we have a distance of time 
p13484
aVsuddenly anything which is over 1000 years becomes sacred in most people s mind 
p13485
aVbut whatever is happening right now 
p13486
aVhowever great it is 
p13487
aVthey don t have the intelligence to recognize this 
p13488
aVpeople are saying the past things are great
p13489
aVsimply because everybody else is saying it 
p13490
aVnot because they truly recognize 
p13491
aVbut we are coming to a time 
p13492
aVif you don t do it 
p13493
aVyour children will do this 
p13494
aVthat is 
p13495
aVa time is coming in the world 
p13496
aVwhere unless it makes sense
p13497
aVit doesn t come 
p13498
aVit doesn t matter from what source it comes from 
p13499
aVeven if god comes and speaks here 
p13500
aVthe next generation will reject it
p13501
aVunless it makes sense to them 
p13502
aVthis is a good development because
p13503
aVinstead of authority being the truth 
p13504
aVtruth is becoming the authority 
p13505
aVit s a good way to go 
p13506
aVbut once this happens 
p13507
aVquestions are going to rise  
p13508
aVall kinds of questions 
p13509
aVwith all due respect to every religious tradition on the planet
p13510
aVi come from a land 
p13511
aVwhich has immense traditions 
p13512
aVunbelievable 
p13513
aVmost 
p13514
aVmost people in the world 
p13515
aVmost indians are not even conscious of this 
p13516
aVhow many traditions  how many ways are there in that land 
p13517
aVwhen mark twain came to india 
p13518
aVhe said   anything that can ever be done either by man or god has been done in this land 
p13519
aVbecause the exploration is so incredible 
p13520
aVbut with all due respect to all of them 
p13521
aVi say this 
p13522
aVthat if you raise three fundamental questions 
p13523
aVninety percent of the scriptural knowledge on the planet will collapse 
p13524
aVi m sorry 
p13525
aVbut this is the truth 
p13526
aVif you ask three pertinent questions 
p13527
aVyou will see ninety percent of the scriptural knowledge on the planet will just collapse 
p13528
aVit can t stand scrutiny 
p13529
aV so what are the three questions  
p13530
aV you are not a scripture  so why should i  
p13531
aV oh no  you said ask three questions 
p13532
aV yes  the fundamental questions 
p13533
aVif you ask  simply 
p13534
aVyou  see  the fundamental thing is this  
p13535
aVyou don t know where you came from 
p13536
aVyou don t know where you will go 
p13537
aVyou can believe 
p13538
aVif we work hard enough on you 
p13539
aVwe can make you believe anything 
p13540
aVyou must know this 
p13541
aVi was just talking to a group of people in nashville  tennessee 
p13542
aVwhere our center is 
p13543
aVi was just telling them a joke 
p13544
aVin the joke 
p13545
aVi referred to god as him 
p13546
aVimmediately  a few ladies stood up and said 
p13547
aV do you believe god is a man 
p13548
aVi said   whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa 
p13549
aVi know what i ve gotten into  you know  
p13550
aVi said   i was just telling you a joke 
p13551
aVthey said   it doesn t matter  you said him 
p13552
aVnow this is a debate in america  
p13553
aVis god a man or a woman 
p13554
aVi think this time in the election they re trying to settle that issue  
p13555
aVbut where we come from 
p13556
aVwe have no such issue 
p13557
aVwe have a man god 
p13558
aVwe have a woman god 
p13559
aVwe have a cow god 
p13560
aVwe have an elephant god 
p13561
aVwe have a snake god 
p13562
aVwe have a bird god 
p13563
aVwe have a dog god 
p13564
aVwe have every kind 
p13565
aVcrawling ones 
p13566
aVcreeping ones 
p13567
aVflying ones  all kinds  
p13568
aVbecause we are a very wise culture 
p13569
aVwe foresaw all the future problems that may arise  
p13570
aVand there is also a debate 
p13571
aVwhich in the last election they tried to settle 
p13572
aVbut it did not settle  i think 
p13573
aVpeople are debating in southern churches  
p13574
aVis god black or white 
p13575
aVit s a big serious debate happening 
p13576
aVpeople really debating about this  
p13577
aVis god white or black 
p13578
aVwell  you know idi amin  the uganda man 
p13579
aVidi amin declared   god is black 
p13580
aVi agree with him because
p13581
aVif a white man can have a white god 
p13582
aVwhy can t a black man have a black god 
p13583
aVbut you know  these people do not know 
p13584
aVbecause in these parts of the world  only messiahs 
p13585
aVprophets  sons  others came 
p13586
aVthey don t know 
p13587
aVin india  we know god is brown  
p13588
ag13166
aVbecause god himself visited india nine times 
p13589
aVare you aware of this  
p13590
aVyou didn t know 
p13591
aVgod visited india nine times  himself 
p13592
aVindians are very proud of this 
p13593
aVbecause god visited us himself nine times
p13594
aVand he sent his son and messenger and others and others to other places  
p13595
aVi keep reminding them  that s because
p13596
aVgod wanted to do the job hands on with indians  
p13597
aVhe couldn t trust anybody else with indians  
p13598
aVhe came nine times and he failed  
p13599
aV let s  let s talk about 
p13600
aV no  coming to belief   i m saying
p13601
aVwe can make people believe anything
p13602
aVif you work upon them from their childhood  
p13603
aVanything  believe me 
p13604
aVyou just have to work hard enough
p13605
aVand make them believe this  that  everything 
p13606
aVbelief gives you a confidence without clarity 
p13607
aVconfidence without clarity is a disaster on this planet 
p13608
aVthere is no substitute for clarity 
p13609
ag13609
aVbut if you have confidence  you can just do something just like that 
p13610
aVsometimes it works 
p13611
aVeven if you re not clear 
p13612
aVyou can simply do something and it ll work 
p13613
aVcan i tell you a joke 
p13614
aV please 
p13615
aV this happened in new york city 
p13616
aVtch 
p13617
aVlate afternoon 
p13618
aVa eight year old boy came back from school 
p13619
aVhe had a very progressive mother 
p13620
aVobviously she was single  
p13621
aVi m saying they couldn t 
p13622
aVnobody catch up with her  
p13623
aVhe came home and he asked 
p13624
aV momma  is god man or woman 
p13625
aVshe thought about all the gender issues
p13626
aVand the coming election and everything
p13627
aVand then she thought about it for a while and she said 
p13628
aV both 
p13629
aVthe boy went into deep thought 
p13630
aVafter a little while  the boy came back and asked 
p13631
aV momma  is god black or white 
p13632
aVagain she thought about all the racial issues in the country
p13633
aVand after considering this at length  she said 
p13634
ag13629
aVthe boy went into very deep thought 
p13635
aVthen after some time  he came back and asked 
p13636
aV momma  is god straight or gay 
p13637
aVshe again thought about it and then she said 
p13638
ag13629
aVthe boy jumped in joy 
p13639
aV i got it  i got it 
p13640
aVit s michael jackson   
p13641
aVso how 
p13642
aVhow we arrived at our belief has cultural backing 
p13643
aVevery culture has made up their own stuff 
p13644
ag13233
aVdo we genuinely know where we came from and where we re going 
p13645
aVif you re so clear where you re going 
p13646
aVthat is for an appointment with the creator 
p13647
aVi don t think you should postpone the appointment 
p13648
aVyou must take it today  isn t it 
p13649
aVbut that s not true 
p13650
aVif death is next moment  you don t want to go 
p13651
aVif you are so sure
p13652
aVonly that fanatic who blows himself up seems to be sure 
p13653
aVeverybody else has a doubt  isn t it 
p13654
aVevery s  working intelligence has a doubt 
p13655
ag13171
aVif you have frozen your intelligence with overriding belief systems 
p13656
aVthen you re going  
p13657
aVevery other working intelligence 
p13658
aVif death is next moment 
p13659
aVthere is hesitation or no 
p13660
aVfor sure  isn t it 
p13661
aVbecause you really don t know where you re going 
p13662
aVyou can believe what you want 
p13663
aVbut you really do not know 
p13664
aVbelief is of social significance 
p13665
aVto some extent of psychological significance 
p13666
aVbut existentially it means nothing 
p13667
aV can i ask your thoughts on this 
p13668
aVin some ways  in many ways  we are the inheritors of our traditions
p13669
aVand they can  and they do influence us and shape us 
p13670
aVis there a positive role for the traditions from whence we come 
p13671
aVfor example 
p13672
aVif i m gonna try to inner engineer my inner life
p13673
aVand try to get some direction and meaning and faith and hope and values 
p13674
aVi can t do it alone 
p13675
aVand there are rich traditions 
p13676
aVhindu traditions 
p13677
aVjudeo christian traditions 
p13678
aVmuslim traditions
p13679
aVthat give some context 
p13680
aVsome meaning 
p13681
aVsome structure upon which to anchor my life 
p13682
aVwhat do you think about that 
p13683
aVdo we throw away all the traditions
p13684
aVand inner engineer our lives
p13685
aVor can we use these traditions 
p13686
aV as you said  to anchor our lives 
p13687
aVnow that is 
p13688
aVthat is the decision that every human being has to make 
p13689
aVdo you want to be anchored
p13690
aVor do you want to set sail 
p13691
aVthat is a decision that everybody has to make 
p13692
aVif you re looking for confidence 
p13693
aVif you re looking for stability 
p13694
aVthen you have to anchor yourself to something 
p13695
aVif you re looking to go far 
p13696
aVthen anchoring will not help 
p13697
aVtraditions 
p13698
aVall traditions  
p13699
aVwith all due respect to all of them  
p13700
aVparticularly traditions that are coming from india and also elsewhere  
p13701
aVi m  i m not in any way an expert on  to make a comment on the traditions
p13702
aVthat you re talking about
p13703
aVbut essentially  tradition means this  
p13704
aVwhat somebody did yesterday is today s culture and tradition 
p13705
aVwhat you do today is tomorrow s culture and tradition 
p13706
aVi m asking you 
p13707
aVhow much of what we re doing today in this world and in this country
p13708
aVis consciously cultured 
p13709
aVbut all the rubbish that we do 
p13710
aVwill become tomorrow s culture and tradition of this land 
p13711
aVisn t it so 
p13712
ag13159
ag13231
aV i m saying  do you believe that people who lived here 1000 years ago
p13713
aVwere such super human beings 
p13714
aVthey did everything perfectly and you re doing everything wrong 
p13715
aVit s not so 
p13716
aVthey were also just people like you 
p13717
aVwe have a way of eulogizing everything
p13718
aVwith which we have a certain distance of time 
p13719
aVbut are they of no value 
p13720
aVnot true 
p13721
aVthere re a whole lot of things 
p13722
aVwhole lot of things
p13723
aVthat we as human beings simply know today 
p13724
aVwhich is thanks to the traditions in which we have grown up 
p13725
aVwe cannot say no 
p13726
aVbut if you want to know this life  which is myself 
p13727
aVno tradition is 
p13728
aVtradition can inspire you 
p13729
aVtradition can put you in a direction 
p13730
aVtradition cannot take you there 
p13731
aVbecause this has to happen now  to you  only then it s a living reality for you 
p13732
aVotherwise you will read in a book and believe it 
p13733
aVbut how do you know this works 
p13734
aVi m saying it should work 
p13735
aVpeople ask me 
p13736
aV sadhguru  how do we know whether we have met a real teacher or a guru or not 
p13737
aVi just tell them 
p13738
aV look at his face  whether it s worked for him  what he s talking  
p13739
aVhas it worked for him 
p13740
aVthat s all the question 
p13741
aVif it s worked for him  it doesn t matter what it is 
p13742
aVyou must go with him because it s worked for him 
p13743
aVif it s not worked for him  what is the point 
p13744
aVdead tradition 
p13745
aV so one of the traditions here in a medical school 
p13746
aVin a western medical school 
p13747
aVis the tradition of the evidence  
p13748
aVshow me 
p13749
aVin this tradition 
p13750
aVwhich is only really maybe two or three hundred years old 
p13751
aVthe randomized controlled trial 
p13752
aVthe cohort study  the  all of that 
p13753
aVand it s good 
p13754
aVthat s how we ve gotten cures for pneumonia
p13755
aVand drugs to help alleviate pain
p13756
aVand it s all been done through this pursuit of the evidence 
p13757
aVthe evidence 
p13758
aVand also i m a pastor
p13759
aVand i fully embrace the life of the spirit
p13760
aVand the truth that we find in our faith traditions 
p13761
aVand i love that tradition 
p13762
aVbut i do recognize a tension 
p13763
ag13331
aVbetween the truth that we discover in the lab
p13764
aVand the truth that we discover in our spirit 
p13765
aVand i love that tension 
p13766
aVi think that s a great way to live in a way 
p13767
aVthat sort of loving and joyful pursuit that is
p13768
aVboth the truth that i see around me and the love that grows in my heart 
p13769
aVbut i do recognize the tension 
p13770
aVwhat is your perception of that 
p13771
aV see  when we talk about the evidence based approach 
p13772
aVit is not a tradition 
p13773
aVwhen it happened 
p13774
aVwhen the renaissance happened  it was breaking of all traditions 
p13775
aVtill then  because it was written in a book 
p13776
aVbecause a certain authority was espousing it 
p13777
aVwe said   this is it 
p13778
aVwhen medical science evolved from jenner  to others 
p13779
aVthe fundamental thing was they broke all tradition 
p13780
aVso now if that is becoming a tradition 
p13781
aVi m very sorry 
p13782
aVbecause this was an exploration 
p13783
aVan exploration cannot be traditional 
p13784
aVan exploration means you re constantly trying to step into new terrain 
p13785
aVthat s what an exploration is 
p13786
aVbut if that has become traditional 
p13787
aVthen we are treading the same track and thinking it s exploration 
p13788
aVthis evidence based approach has done wonders to many many things
p13789
aVno question
p13790
aVbut this entire process is dependent upon human intellect 
p13791
aVthis is what  we are just coming into
p13792
aVwe went off little bit
p13793
aVhuman intellect by nature
p13794
aVi am just asking you
p13795
aVwould you like it sharp or blunt
p13796
aVif you want sharp
p13797
aVif you have a sharp instrument let's say you have a knife in your hand
p13798
aVwhat could you do to this flower
p13799
aVwith a knife 
p13800
aVyou could cut it finely if you want but
p13801
aVyou can cut into pieces
p13802
aVthat's exactly what the intelligence does
p13803
aVwhatever you give it it will cut it open and try to see
p13804
aVthe way of evidence based science is disection fundamentally
p13805
aVwell  even in the medical school  i m sure
p13806
aVwe re
p13807
aVin the pathology labs we are opening up 
p13808
aVfortunately the dead  
p13809
aVbut if you really want to know somebody 
p13810
aVsomeone whom you love very much 
p13811
aVif you really want to know them 
p13812
aVi think you should dissect them to know them 
p13813
aVwould it work like that 
p13814
aVno  obviously 
p13815
aVso  there is one dimension of life 
p13816
aVwhich is physical in nature 
p13817
aVwhere dissection will work 
p13818
aVbut what is physical about you 
p13819
aVthe body that you carry 
p13820
aVis an accumulation that you gathered over a period of time 
p13821
aVit s just the food that you ve eaten 
p13822
aVit is actually a piece of the planet 
p13823
aVmost people don t get this when they re walking 
p13824
aVbut the countless number of people who walked on this planet before you and me 
p13825
aVthey are all topsoil today 
p13826
aVyou and me also will be topsoil 
p13827
aVunless your friends choose to bury you real deep  
p13828
aVfearing that you may raise from the dead  
p13829
aVthis is just the soil  isn t it 
p13830
ag13159
ag13617
aVthis is just the soil that you walk upon 
p13831
aVso this is an accumulation 
p13832
aVwhat you gather 
p13833
aVwhat you accumulate 
p13834
aVyou can claim   it is mine 
p13835
aVyou cannot say   it s me  isn t it 
p13836
aVright now  as i m speaking 
p13837
aVi say   this is my glass 
p13838
aVyou will think 
p13839
aV oh  sadhguru seems to have a problem  
p13840
aVbut let s listen  everybody says he s wise   
p13841
aVafter some time i ll say   this is me 
p13842
aVthen you will say   let s go home   
p13843
aVbecause if i claim this is me  you know it is 
p13844
aVit qualifies for madness  isn t it 
p13845
aVwhatever you acquire 
p13846
aVyou can say   this is mine 
p13847
aVbut if you say   this is me  this is madness 
p13848
ag13171
aVare there any psychiatrists 
p13849
aVdo i  do this 
p13850
aVdoes this qualify  
p13851
aVit does 
p13852
aVso  every day you re doing this 
p13853
aVfood appeared on your plate  you said   this is my food 
p13854
aVyou ate it and then you say   it s me 
p13855
aVthis is madness 
p13856
aVbut you have enormous company  
p13857
aVand we believe in democracy 
p13858
aVwhatever the majority says must be right 
p13859
aVso  it is going on 
p13860
aVbut the moment you believe something that is not you as yourself 
p13861
aVyou kind of lost it 
p13862
aVyou re derailed from life 
p13863
aVso  turning inward does not mean dissection 
p13864
aVturning inward does not mean contemplation
p13865
aVbecause the content of your body
p13866
aVand the content of your mind is an accumulated substance  isn t it 
p13867
aVyou gathered it from outside 
p13868
aVwhat you gather from outside can be yours
p13869
aVbut can never ever be you 
p13870
aVso  we re talking about inner engineering 
p13871
aVnot as twisting and turning the body 
p13872
aVnot about taking on new attitudes of love or generosity  compassion 
p13873
aVwhatever great values and emotions that a human being can have 
p13874
aVi see all that as a consequence of a certain way of being 
p13875
aVrather than looking at it as a means to get somewhere 
p13876
aVeverywhere  people are talking about whatever 
p13877
aVsee  if you deprive somebody of something for a period of time 
p13878
aVsimply qualities will raise to heaven 
p13879
aVtoday  anywhere you go  people are talking 
p13880
aV peace of mind is the ultimate goal of human life 
p13881
aVwhy 
p13882
aVbecause they re freaked out in their minds  
p13883
aVwhy would peace be the highest goal 
p13884
aVbecause you re talking about judeo christian thing 
p13885
aVthe origin of where it came from
p13886
aVi happened to be in tel aviv 
p13887
aVi am to 
p13888
aV30 in the evening 
p13889
aVi was flying in from atlanta 
p13890
aVbecause of some delays in the flights 
p13891
aV00 in the evening 
p13892
aVso  i m quickly changing in the airport
p13893
aVbecause in these thirty five years 
p13894
aVi ve not been late to a single appointment 
p13895
aVi don t want to break that 
p13896
aVso i m rushing 
p13897
aVand i am famished
p13898
aVbecause i m traveling an american airline
p13899
aVand there s nothing edible on the plane  
p13900
aVi m super hungry
p13901
aVand i rush to the venue 
p13902
aVand to my joy 
p13903
aVi find the talk is in a fine restaurant 
p13904
aVlife can t get better  
p13905
aVso as i went in 
p13906
aVpeople are greeting me and one man comes up and says 
p13907
aV shalom 
p13908
aVi ask him   what does it mean 
p13909
aVhe says   this is the highest way of greeting 
p13910
aVi said   well  that s your opinion  but what does it mean 
p13911
aVhe said   no  this is the highest way of greeting 
p13912
aVi said   that s all right  but what does the word mean 
p13913
aVhe said   it means peace 
p13914
aVi said   why would peace be the highest way of greeting 
p13915
aVunless you re born in middle east   
p13916
aVin south india 
p13917
aVyou come up to me in the morning and say   peace 
p13918
aVi ll say   what s wrong with you   
p13919
aV i d like to get back to the practice of medicine
p13920
aVjust for a question really 
p13921
aVi tell my gang 
p13922
aVwhom i adore
p13923
aVmy residents 
p13924
aVmy students are close to my heart 
p13925
aVi adore them 
p13926
aV all gangs are like that  
p13927
aV and i say 
p13928
aVi say medicine is easy 
p13929
aVmedicine is easy
p13930
aVbut healing is hard because in medicine 
p13931
aVwe have our potions and if we don t know an answer 
p13932
aVwe do a test and if we don t know the 
p13933
aVwhat the test means  we consult somebody 
p13934
aVand so medicine  in some ways 
p13935
aVwe can distill it down 
p13936
aVwe can make it easy 
p13937
aVbut healing 
p13938
aVhealing is really where the art of medicine lies 
p13939
aVand healing is where the spirit and the love and the suffering
p13940
aVand the treatments and the surgery 
p13941
aVthat s where it all comes together 
p13942
aVhow would you propose that we adopt a healing attitude 
p13943
aVhow do we bring the spirit of healing
p13944
aVinto the experience of the bedside 
p13945
aV please  all of you 
p13946
aVdon t be offended by what i say
p13947
aVbut you must look at this properly 
p13948
aVif i 
p13949
aVi  i don t 
p13950
aVbut if at any time 
p13951
aVif it becomes necessary i must go to a hospital 
p13952
aVi just want efficient treatment 
p13953
aVi don t want love 
p13954
aVbecause i m not deprived like that 
p13955
aVnow unfortunately 
p13956
aVwe are creating a population
p13957
aVwhere everywhere people are talking about love 
p13958
aVwe are deprived like this because
p13959
aVearly age deprivation of love will tell right through your life 
p13960
aVit is very important 
p13961
aVwe need to understand
p13962
aVthat there is something more to this life 
p13963
aVthan the acquired body 
p13964
aVwe have a body  which we acquired 
p13965
aVthere s something more 
p13966
aVthere is a whole tradition in india
p13967
aVunfortunately  it s rapidly vanishing because of variety of changes
p13968
aVthat are happening in the society 
p13969
aVotherwise  how a mother should deal with a child
p13970
aVtill the child is four and a half years of age 
p13971
aVin the 
p13972
aVin the vernacular languages 
p13973
aVit says that she should wrap herself around the child 
p13974
aVin every possible way 
p13975
aVnot
p13976
aVbecause the food that you give the child 
p13977
aVthe milk that you give the child is not the only nourishment 
p13978
aVthe child needs to be wrapped with motherhood 
p13979
aVthen only this child will grow as a full fledged child 
p13980
aVotherwise  it will grow as a deprived child 
p13981
aVbut modern societies 
p13982
aVwe are going to a place  which is almost impossible to deliver this 
p13983
aVit s simply not possible 
p13984
aVin the way we have structured our families 
p13985
aVit s simply not possible to do that 
p13986
aVso  having said that 
p13987
aVwhen people come to a hospital 
p13988
aVthey should just look forward to efficient treatment 
p13989
aVnow we re looking for love 
p13990
aVwe should have found it somewhere else 
p13991
aVat least we should have bought a dog  
p13992
aVif you couldn t find anybody 
p13993
aVdog is  you know 
p13994
aVif you get yourself a dog  twelve years guaranteed love affair 
p13995
aVguaranteed 
p13996
aVdoesn t matter how badly behaved you are 
p13997
aVstill it s guaranteed 
p13998
aVit ll not work with any human being  
p13999
aVthere s a whole lot of management to do with human beings 
p14000
aVif you get a dog 
p14001
aVhowever badly behaved you are 
p14002
aVyou are a drunk  you behave badly 
p14003
aVyou beat him  do what you do 
p14004
aVbut the dog still loves you
p14005
aVguaranteed love affair 
p14006
aVso  those of you who are looking for love wherever you go 
p14007
aVdog is a good solution  
p14008
aVwhen you go to a hospital 
p14009
aVyou don t expect your doctor to love you 
p14010
aVjust do what he has to do  
p14011
aV so that is fascinating 
p14012
aVbecause i think patients come to their doctors 
p14013
aV this  this is the unfortunate
p14014
aVthis is the unfortunate reality  that s what i m saying 
p14015
aVpeople come to a hospital and looking for love  
p14016
aVwrong place  
p14017
aV so when i was a
p14018
aVwhen i was a medical student 
p14019
aVi was the pastor of a church here in town
p14020
aVand i would write my sermons on hospital notepaper 
p14021
aVthis was before emrs  
p14022
aVso i m writing my sermon at the nurse s station
p14023
aVand my attending physician came up to me and he said 
p14024
aV doolittle  physicians are the priests of today 
p14025
aVi said   what 
p14026
aVwhat do you mean 
p14027
aVthat s offensi  i wasn t sure what 
p14028
aVwas he joking
p14029
aVwas he serious 
p14030
aVand he was serious  
p14031
aVin the sense that people come to their doctor and they have pain
p14032
aVand maybe it s back pain 
p14033
aVmay be it's pain in their hearts
p14034
aVand i think people come to their physician
p14035
aVand they look for absolution
p14036
aVacceptance  forgiveness 
p14037
aVthey look to feel well again 
p14038
aVand perhaps the critique of modern medicine is that
p14039
aVwe are trained to give a pill but people want more 
p14040
aVand it s interesting that you bring this up that in modern medicine
p14041
aVthe expectation should be efficient care  safe care 
p14042
aVand that s what we re trying to do too 
p14043
aVbut i do think 
p14044
aV there is a healing
p14045
aV maybe the world is becoming more secular
p14046
aVand they don t know where to turn
p14047
aVand so people look to their healthcare provider
p14048
aVfor all of it 
p14049
aVwhat do you think 
p14050
aV see  it s not about being secular or non secular 
p14051
aVa whole lot of human beings are feeling lonely 
p14052
ag13231
aV right from their childhood  they ve suffered loneliness 
p14053
aVfor variety of reasons 
p14054
aVchanges have happened in family structure 
p14055
aVchanges have happened in the social structure 
p14056
aVthe communities of the past have broken 
p14057
aVso  there is a certain loneliness 
p14058
aVwhere even if they go to a  their car mechanic 
p14059
aVthey want to be loved  
p14060
aVyou must go to your physician
p14061
aVjust the way you went to a car mechanic 
p14062
aVsomebody who knows how to fix the car 
p14063
aVthat s important 
p14064
aVwhether he loves you or not is not your business 
p14065
aVbut when you talk about healing 
p14066
aVthere s another dimension 
p14067
aVwe re preparing people like this 
p14068
aVi m bringing up hundreds of people 
p14069
aVwhere we have identified in the yogic culture
p14070
aVi mean  in the yogic science  
p14071
aVthe fundamental life energy manifests itself in five different ways 
p14072
aVfive fundamental ways 
p14073
aVthese five
p14074
aVout of these five 
p14075
aVthis is called as
p14076
aVprana vayu 
p14077
aVsamana vayu 
p14078
aVapana 
p14079
aVudhana
p14080
aVand vyana 
p14081
aVin this  there is one dimension called samana vayu 
p14082
aVwhich is very healing 
p14083
aVso  before we introduce any kind of medical knowledge to a person 
p14084
aVwe put them on very serious inner work
p14085
aVto generate a certain level of samana vayu 
p14086
aVwhere a physician develops such a level of vitality 
p14087
aVif he walks into the room 
p14088
aVeverything should light up 
p14089
aVthis is very important 
p14090
aVphysicians are walking into the patient s room with a grave face 
p14091
aVgrave is one thing that you should not point at when somebody is sick  
p14092
aVgrave is one thing that you don t show a patient 
p14093
aVa physician should generate such a level of vitality
p14094
aVand life and healthfulness about themselves 
p14095
aVanything they touch will get better  naturally
p14096
aVnot because of love  not because of compassion 
p14097
aVpeople  you know 
p14098
aVyesterday i was being interviewed by a young lady
p14099
aVand she said 
p14100
aV sadhguru  we must  you know 
p14101
aVeverything should happen out of compassion 
p14102
aVi asked her   are you married 
p14103
aVshe said   yes  my husband is waiting in the reception 
p14104
aVi said   suppose when you go there after this interview 
p14105
aVyou realize
p14106
aVthat your husband married you on a compassionate basis  
p14107
aVwould you like it 
p14108
aVshe said  no   
p14109
aVthen why do you want it for me  
p14110
aVi don t need it too 
p14111
aV so can i ask you with 
p14112
aVso for the isha foundation 
p14113
aVwith the thousands of full time volunteers
p14114
aVand the millions of part time volunteers 
p14115
aVwhy do you think they come 
p14116
aV tools of transformation 
p14117
aVthe tools are subjective in nature 
p14118
aVsee  right now 
p14119
aVwe as human beings are dominating this world
p14120
aVonly because of our ability to use tools 
p14121
aVotherwise  a pack of dogs would take care of you 
p14122
aVforget about the tigers and the lions
p14123
aVpoor tigers and poor lions  who need to be saved right now 
p14124
aVonly because of our ability to use tools  isn t it 
p14125
aVand all the tools that we developed are 
p14126
aVnow as a doctor 
p14127
aVmaybe you re using a microscope 
p14128
aVwe have a microscope  only because we are ability 
p14129
aVour ability to see 
p14130
aVto enhance that we have a scope 
p14131
aVwe have a telescope only to enhance our vision in some other way 
p14132
aVwe have a telephone because we can hear 
p14133
aVwe have a microphone because we can speak 
p14134
aVwe have a bicycle because we can walk 
p14135
aVif we were made like trees 
p14136
aVwould we have invented a bicycle  i m asking 
p14137
aVevery tool that we created is only in  to enhance the already existing faculties to a higher level  isn t it 
p14138
aVeverything 
p14139
aVeverything that we invented is just this  all the tools 
p14140
aVthe tools are very important 
p14141
aVwhen i refer to the spiritual dimension as tools 
p14142
aVsome of our people will feel offended around me and say 
p14143
aV sadhguru  don t say it  it is more than our life 
p14144
aVdon t use the word tool 
p14145
aVthen i tell them 
p14146
aV you come to the yoga center 
p14147
aVthree days i will give you plumbing job 
p14148
aVno spanner  no wrench  no nothing 
p14149
aVyou do it with your hands 
p14150
aVyou can use your teeth  
p14151
aVyou will see all your ten nails will be gone 
p14152
aVthen a few teeth will be gone after three days 
p14153
aVthen you come to me  i will give you a spanner 
p14154
aVwill you worship the spanner or no 
p14155
ag13707
ag14155
aVit is the tools 
p14156
aVsimilarly  to turn inward 
p14157
aVto extend dimensions which you re you re
p14158
aVevery one of you have known peace in your life at some moment 
p14159
ag13159
aVyou must tell me yes or no 
p14160
aV you have known joy in your life 
p14161
aV you have known bliss in your life 
p14162
aV you have known ecstasy in your life 
p14163
aVlove in your life 
p14164
aVyou are capable of all these things 
p14165
aVonly thing is it s not sustainable 
p14166
aVone moment there  one moment here  one moment there  one moment here  
p14167
aVthis is the only problem  isn t it 
p14168
aVsuppose i gave you a tool 
p14169
aVsubjective tool
p14170
aVwith which you can remain blissful every moment of your life 
p14171
aVis it of great value to you  i m asking 
p14172
aV so  these millions of people 
p14173
aVthey have tasted the tools of transformation 
p14174
aVone thing i have done to them is  
p14175
aVi have confused the hell out of them  
p14176
aV so what is that tool of transformation 
p14177
aVhow would you describe that 
p14178
aV this is the first tool 
p14179
aVfirst thing is  you must get confused  
p14180
aVyes  because you are talking about anchoring  that s why i m saying this 
p14181
aVconfusion means you realize that you do not know  isn t it 
p14182
aVi m asking  with all this exploration of science 
p14183
aVdo we know even one single atom in its entirety 
p14184
ag13159
aVdo we 
p14185
ag13007
aVthen what s our problem in saying we don t know 
p14186
aV i do not know  is an immense possibility 
p14187
aVnow  you re trying to destroy  i do not know 
p14188
aVwith all kinds of beliefs 
p14189
aVwhy don t you say   i do not know 
p14190
aVif you truly realize  i do not know 
p14191
aVyour intelligence will be in a active and super alert state every moment of your life 
p14192
aVthe moment you believe  it sleeps 
p14193
aVit lets you sleep 
p14194
aVbut people are not willing to go through this 
p14195
aVthey want something 
p14196
aVtell them something  they want to believe and say   i m fine 
p14197
aVi want to sleep tonight 
p14198
ag13007
aV i do not know 
p14199
aVif you see  i do not know 
p14200
aVthe longing to know 
p14201
aVthe wanting to know 
p14202
aVthe seeking to know will happen to you 
p14203
aVeverything that you do not know  you just believe
p14204
aVbecause somebody said so 
p14205
aVeven if it is true
p14206
aVright now  i m going to tell you what is the truth 
p14207
aVbut it s not in your experience 
p14208
aVso what is the options that you have 
p14209
aVyou can believe me or you can disbelieve me  isn t it 
p14210
aVif you believe me  you will not get any closer to truth 
p14211
aVif you disbelieve me  you will not get any closer to truth 
p14212
aVit is just that if you believe me  you will have a positive story to tell 
p14213
aVif you disbelieve me  you will have a negative story to tell 
p14214
aVbut you will not move an inch existentially 
p14215
aVpsychologically  it will give you comfort 
p14216
aVso this is something you must decide 
p14217
aVare you looking for solace 
p14218
aVor are you looking for a solution 
p14219
aVif you re looking for solution  then you need tools to turn inward 
p14220
aVif you re looking for solace  believe something 
p14221
aV so if the first step is  i don t know 
p14222
aVwhat do you do then 
p14223
aVwhat happens after that  
p14224
aV see  this happened to me when i was just four  four and a half years of age 
p14225
aVsuddenly one day  i realized i don t know a thing 
p14226
aVi was only about four and a half years of age 
p14227
aVif somebody gave me a glass of water 
p14228
aVi would just sit like this for three four hours at a stretch
p14229
aVbecause i wouldn t know what is water 
p14230
aVi m telling you  even today you don t know what is water 
p14231
aVit is the only substance  which is in all the three states on the planet 
p14232
aVtwo thirds of your body is water 
p14233
aVtwo thirds of the planet is water 
p14234
aVbut you don t know what it is 
p14235
aVwe know how to use it but we don t know what it is 
p14236
ag13712
aVwe know how to use this water in so many ways
p14237
aVbut we do not know what it really is 
p14238
aVbecause we do not know what really anything is for that matter 
p14239
aVso if i found a leaf 
p14240
aVi would simply sit like this for six seven hours 
p14241
aVif i sat up in the bed 
p14242
aVentire night i would be staring at the darkness 
p14243
aVmy dear father  who is a physician  
p14244
aVstarted thinking i need psychiatric evaluation
p14245
aVhe started saying   this boy has lost it 
p14246
aVhe s just staring at something all the time 
p14247
aVmy problem is  i look at this and i don t know this 
p14248
aVi m not able to shift my attention to that 
p14249
aVi m just looking here still 
p14250
aVhe thought he could educate me 
p14251
aVhe tried 
p14252
aVso  there is a rule  strict rule in the house
p14253
aV00  dinner time  you 
p14254
aVall the children  four of us siblings 
p14255
aVwe have to sit and read some textbook 
p14256
aVi open my textbook like this  
p14257
aVi find a little speck on the paper 
p14258
aVi just look at the paper   
p14259
aVthis speck keeps me engaged for two hours 
p14260
aVi sit like this  absolutely total attention 
p14261
aVwithout reading a word 
p14262
aVi went through school like this 
p14263
aVi was very consistent 
p14264
aVi always got six zeros in every test  
p14265
aV so if  if it s not shalom 
p14266
aVor compassion or love  
p14267
aV it is just life 
p14268
aV  it s just  what would you  is that what you say the meaning of 
p14269
aV it s just life 
p14270
aV  the meaning  the purpose 
p14271
aV no  no 
p14272
aV  your purpose of life  is life  what would you say 
p14273
aV the purpose of life is life itself 
p14274
aV yeah 
p14275
aV is  life itself is a large enough phenomena it doesn t need another meaning 
p14276
aVonly because human beings have not experienced life 
p14277
aVthey re just a bundle of thoughts  emotions 
p14278
aVideas  opinions 
p14279
aVidentities and prejudices 
p14280
aV sadhguru 
p14281
aV because of this  they re looking for a meaning
p14282
aVbecause they re psychological scape has overshadowed the existential life that they are 
p14283
aVright now  all that they re experiencing is a minimalistic mind  not life 
p14284
aVif you look at life 
p14285
aVwhat is the nature of life 
p14286
aVas you sit there 
p14287
aVwe are breathing for sure 
p14288
ag13159
aV those who are not will need medical attention  
p14289
aVwe re breathing 
p14290
aVbreathing means in some way  this life  is in communication with the entire atmosphere 
p14291
aVin fact  this 
p14292
aVthis green  you know 
p14293
aVproject greenhands of planting trees 
p14294
aVthe entire movement was instigated like this by me 
p14295
aVi took a bunch of people 
p14296
aVabout 3 4000 people came 
p14297
aVi said   all of you should come 
p14298
aVthey came  i arranged a meeting in a village 
p14299
aVthere was a big tree  a rain tree  a few  three  four trees were there 
p14300
aVlarge trees 
p14301
aVbut i arranged the meeting around eleven o clock in the hot sun in southern india 
p14302
aVso i stood there and i am speaking to them  they are all   sitting like this 
p14303
aVslowly as the sun gets hotter  hotter  they re just wilting away 
p14304
aVand i m speaking and speaking something  telling them stories
p14305
aVand i m watching how they re just wilting away 
p14306
aVsee  walking in the sun is one thing 
p14307
aVif you simply sit there  it ll just burn you down 
p14308
aVthey re just thinking 
p14309
aV what s happened to sadhguru 
p14310
aVhe s become like this  heartless   
p14311
aVthen after about an hour and a half  when they re really going down 
p14312
aVthen i say   get up all of you  and i  then i walk them under the shade of the tree 
p14313
aV ahh 
p14314
aVyou know what a tree is only if you sit in the sun  in hot sun  for an hour and a half  two 
p14315
aVthen walk under the tree 
p14316
aVit feels like paradise 
p14317
aVthey all    hahh 
p14318
aVi made them sit down and said 
p14319
aV see  what you exhale  the trees are inhaling  what the trees exhale  you are inhaling 
p14320
aVlook at this 
p14321
aVone part of your lung is hanging out there 
p14322
aVand i created a process with which they could experience this 
p14323
aVthey just sat there like this with tears in their eyes
p14324
aVand that is it  project greenhands  twenty seven million trees they have planted 
p14325
aV yeah  very nice 
p14326
aV now you can t stop them  
p14327
aVthey re planting and planting
p14328
aVbecause now they see it s a part of them 
p14329
aVis it not true that you exist here as a part of everything else 
p14330
aVit is just that it s a privilege 
p14331
aVthough you are a speck in the universe 
p14332
aVless than a speck 
p14333
aVstill we are given an intellect 
p14334
aVwe have been given senses of perception 
p14335
aVwe can experience this like an individual 
p14336
aVbut in reality 
p14337
aVif you observe yourself 
p14338
aVyou cannot exist by yourself even for a  a nanosecond  isn t it 
p14339
aVthe entire universe is supporting you 
p14340
aVso the only way life can happen is an inclusive way 
p14341
aVso yoga means just this 
p14342
aVthe word yoga means union 
p14343
aVunion means the boundaries of what is inward and outward  you took it away 
p14344
aVthere is no such thing as you and the other 
p14345
aVif you sit here 
p14346
aVwe can do an experiment actually 
p14347
aVi don t know if time allows 
p14348
aVif you sit here and suppose for one moment 
p14349
aVyou experienced all these people here as a part of yourself 
p14350
aVlike you experience the five fingers of your hand 
p14351
aVhow is that possible 
p14352
aVwell  what is this body today  yesterday it was not your body  isn t it 
p14353
aVit was food 
p14354
aVtoday it s become body 
p14355
aVso something that is not you  became you  how 
p14356
aVright now  there is water  this is not you 
p14357
aVif i drink it  does it become me 
p14358
aVdefinitely does 
p14359
aVso what is it that i have done 
p14360
aVi included it into the boundaries of my sensations 
p14361
aVwhat is within my boundaries of sensation  i experience as myself 
p14362
aVwhat is outside of my boundaries of sensation is not me 
p14363
aVnow  the yogic system 
p14364
aVwe developed a way that if you keep your energies in a certain level of exuberance 
p14365
aVnow you will see your sensory body will expand 
p14366
aVif your sensory body became as large as this hall
p14367
aVand you experienced all these people as yourself 
p14368
aVafter that do i have to tell you 
p14369
aV love them 
p14370
aVdon t hate them 
p14371
aVdon t kill them 
p14372
aVdon t harm them 
p14373
aVbe compassionate 
p14374
aVwould teachings be necessary for you 
p14375
aVif you experience something as a part of yourself 
p14376
aVafter that you don t need any morality 
p14377
aVyou don t need any ethic 
p14378
aVyou don t need any values 
p14379
aVwhat is you  you will always handle it right 
p14380
aVwhat is you  it is of the highest concern to you 
p14381
aVif you experienced everyone and everything as yourself 
p14382
aVthis is what yoga means 
p14383
aVif one is in such a state of union 
p14384
aVthen you call him a yogi 
p14385
aVif you turn and twist your body and hang upside down  you are not a yogi 
p14386
aVyou are just doing circus  
p14387
aVyes  unfortunately  people think by turning and twisting they re doing yoga 
p14388
ag13007
aVyoga means you sat here 
p14389
aVyou experience the entire universe as yourself  
p14390
aVnot as a hallucination but as a living experience 
p14391
aVnot in the firmament of your mind but existentially you know this is you 
p14392
aVnow you don t need any policy 
p14393
aVyou don't need any morality 
p14394
aVyou don t need any scripture 
p14395
aVyou don t need any guidance from anywhere 
p14396
aVyou will conduct this  sensibly
p14397
aVto the best of your intelligence and capability 
p14398
aVand that s all a human being can do 
p14399
ag14281
aVso we ve reached 
p14400
aV my question is touching back to the point which you brought up about the belief 
p14401
aVcan you tell a little bit more about
p14402
aVwhat s the difference between belief and faith  
p14403
aV you re trying to gather more information  
p14404
aV as much as i can in one hour 
p14405
aV that is the biggest problem 
p14406
aVyou can gather as much as you want  you could
p14407
aVif you gather a lot  you ll become fat 
p14408
aVbut you will not feel enhanced 
p14409
aVthe only thing that every life is seeking is to enhance itself to its fullest possible level 
p14410
aVwhether you take a worm  or an insect  or a bird or a tree 
p14411
aVall of them want to become full fledged life 
p14412
aVonly problem is 
p14413
aVwe know what is a full fledged worm 
p14414
aVwe know what is a full fledged insect 
p14415
aVwe know what is a full fledged tree 
p14416
aVbut we don t know what is a full fledged human being 
p14417
aVnow you think by acquiring more and more 
p14418
aVi don't know what information you gathered 
p14419
aVbut by acquiring more and more 
p14420
aVyou will not become more 
p14421
aVit has not happened  isn t it 
p14422
aVpeople thought by acquiring money 
p14423
aVby acquiring wealth 
p14424
aVby acquiring knowledge they will become more 
p14425
aVthey have not become more 
p14426
aVthey re still hankering for the same things 
p14427
aVso  by acquiring more information 
p14428
aVyou will not become enhanced 
p14429
aVit is just that if you approach information sensibly 
p14430
aVyou will become more hungry 
p14431
aVif you approach information as a way of projecting yourself as better than somebody else 
p14432
aVthen you will think you have attained to something 
p14433
aVthis is what happens by acquiring information 
p14434
aVonly in comparison  it s valuable 
p14435
aVif you have certain level of information 
p14436
aVyou need somebody around you who doesn t know it for you to be looking smart 
p14437
aVyes  
p14438
aVtoday  it s become a fashion 
p14439
aVbefore they go to a dinner party  they will google out
p14440
aVthat galaxy z67  how many million light years is it 
p14441
aVso when you go to a dinner party 
p14442
aVjust like that casually you throw around  
p14443
aV you know the galaxy z67 
p14444
aVit is you know how many light years 
p14445
aVthis many light years 
p14446
aVwho the hell cares  
p14447
aVbecause we don t even know in our experience what is a light year  
p14448
aVit is only a mathematical calculation 
p14449
aVit is not really anybody s experience 
p14450
aVthere is no human being on this planet  past or present 
p14451
aVwho s ever experienced a light year 
p14452
aVthere s no such thing 
p14453
aVit is only a mathematic calculation
p14454
aVto somehow come to terms with the immeasurable dimensions of the existence 
p14455
aVwe re trying to somehow quantify it 
p14456
aVso that it comes into our understanding 
p14457
aVbut nothing comes into our understanding 
p14458
aVas science explores more and more 
p14459
aVit is only getting more confounded 
p14460
aVthe only reason why science is surviving is
p14461
aVbecause it s throwing out useful technologies on the side 
p14462
aVif that was not there 
p14463
aVscience is far more confused in hundred years of exploration than it ever was before 
p14464
aVbut that s a good sign 
p14465
aVif they had made stupid conclusions 
p14466
aVthey would be a one more religion 
p14467
aVscience is confounded today 
p14468
aVthe top physicists in the world are saying 
p14469
aV we not only do not know 
p14470
aVwe know we will never know 
p14471
aV  this is a good sign because
p14472
aVthis means your intelligence will remain on an explorative mode all the time  
p14473
aVon an active mode 
p14474
aVnot in a sleep mode 
p14475
aVso  when
p14476
aVwhen the top scientists declare 
p14477
aV we will not know 
p14478
aVit is not a hopeless situation 
p14479
aVit is a great situation that people have come to this 
p14480
aVthat they understand if you go through physical means 
p14481
aVit doesn t matter how much you explore  it ll go on endlessly 
p14482
aVhow much information you have  you will not get any better 
p14483
aVyou will get only more burdened by this 
p14484
aVthings will happen on the side  technologies will come 
p14485
aViphone will become seven  eight  twelve  all right 
p14486
aVbut still  the way you talk to people is not going to change  
p14487
aVwhat you say will not change 
p14488
aVyour relationships will not change 
p14489
aVtechnology can go through the ceiling
p14490
aVbut nothing of you will be enhanced 
p14491
aVso  more information 
p14492
aVmore information is not going to help 
p14493
aVall i want you to take  
p14494
aVthe takeaway for you
p14495
aVbecause you want to take away something   
p14496
aVthe takeaway for you is
p14497
aVif you truly  genuinely  
p14498
aVit s not simply a thought  
p14499
aVallow this to sink into you in the next few days 
p14500
aVthat if you pay attention to anything 
p14501
aVa leaf 
p14502
aVa flower 
p14503
aVwater 
p14504
aVpeople 
p14505
aVdog 
p14506
aVanimals 
p14507
aVanything  anything 
p14508
aVif you pay enough attention to anything around you 
p14509
aVeven the closest people around you 
p14510
aVif you pay enough attention to them 
p14511
aVyou will see you don t know a damn thing about anything 
p14512
aVon the surface  you seem to know everything 
p14513
aVbut if you pay sufficient attention 
p14514
aVyou don't know a thing about anything 
p14515
aVknowledge is a very limited sphere of life 
p14516
aVignorance is boundless 
p14517
aVenjoy that  
p14518
aV so  in the spirit of boundless ignorance 
p14519
aVdoes anyone else have any questions 
p14520
aVthere s a lot 
p14521
aVmaybe someone
p14522
aV she has the microphone  yeah  
p14523
aV yeah  you got the mike  go ahead 
p14524
aV hello 
p14525
aVthank you very much for a wonderful lecture
p14526
aVand you re definitely very smart man  
p14527
aVmy question is 
p14528
aV that s the worst insult anybody has thrown at me  
p14529
aV he started by saying he doesn t know anything 
p14530
aVthat was his whole 
p14531
aV maybe this is the main sign of a smart person 
p14532
aVso my question is that you mentioned before that
p14533
aVjust belief without clarity is not a good thing 
p14534
aVand i m absolutely impressed by amount of volunteers 
p14535
aVlike millions of the volunteers 
p14536
aVi cannot even imagine how many people come flown in and not volunteer
p14537
aVand so it s a lot 
p14538
aVdo you think they are all driven by clarity and search for clarity 
p14539
aVor they believe that once they will do inner engineering 
p14540
aVthey will work on the process of gaining joy
p14541
aVand eventually they will have a positive story with you
p14542
aVor the positive story  as you mentioned before 
p14543
aVthank you 
p14544
aV see  if 
p14545
aVfor any human being to do something 
p14546
aVeither it should have worked for them 
p14547
aVor it should have worked for somebody around them 
p14548
aVif you want to buy a car 
p14549
aVeither you will test drive it and see whether it works for you
p14550
aVor you ll ask the opinion of your friend who is driving that particular car 
p14551
aV is this been good for you 
p14552
ag13171
aVso i must tell you  a  as a rule 
p14553
aVfor the first twenty  twenty one years of my existence as a teacher 
p14554
aVas a rule 
p14555
aVi never appeared in the media  
p14556
aVnever once   
p14557
aVto a point  where media started writing about me 
p14558
aV he s running some kind of a secret school  
p14559
aVbecause i refused to meet the media 
p14560
aVno advertisement 
p14561
aVno any kind of posters 
p14562
aVnot even a brochure 
p14563
aVonly by word of mouth  millions of people came 
p14564
aVbecause once it works for somebody 
p14565
aVthey want it to work for their family 
p14566
aVtheir friends and things 
p14567
aVthat s how it happened 
p14568
aVin the last fifteen years or sixteen years now  
p14569
aVfifteen actually  
p14570
aVfrom 2001 is when you have heard about me all over
p14571
aVbecause we re making a lot of noise in the last fifteen years 
p14572
aVbecause these projects 
p14573
aVwhich we started as small endeavors in the local area 
p14574
aVcaught on so well and they became such major projects of planting trees 
p14575
aVeducation  health
p14576
aVwe are active in 53 000 villages 
p14577
aVso  it needs enormous support 
p14578
aVotherwise this can't be done 
p14579
aVfor a  a non religious movement 
p14580
aVwhich doesn t offer any miracles like this
p14581
aVnever before  as i know  in the last two hundred  three hundred years 
p14582
aVnever before  a spiritual movement has caught on this kind of following 
p14583
aVwhere no ticket to heaven 
p14584
aVno miracles 
p14585
aVno any kind of stuff 
p14586
aVonly thing i m telling them is 
p14587
aVbadgering them that you are the source of all your troubles  
p14588
aVnobody else but you 
p14589
aVbut millions are gathering 
p14590
aVwhich is very  fantastic because
p14591
ag13198
aVabout thirty years ago  when i conducted programs 
p14592
aVover eighty five percent of the people came because of health reasons  
p14593
aVphysical  mental ailments 
p14594
aVtoday  on an average 
p14595
aVonly about twelve percent of the people are coming for health reasons 
p14596
aVthe rest are coming because they re seeking 
p14597
aVthey want to know 
p14598
aVthey want to experience 
p14599
aVthey want their lives to be touched in a deeper way than the way it is touched right now 
p14600
aVthis is a phenomenal change that you re seeing in the world 
p14601
aVit s never before  i think 
p14602
aVonly twelve percent are coming for health reasons 
p14603
aVbut at one time 
p14604
aVover eighty percent were coming for health reasons 
p14605
aVwhich is a big shift 
p14606
aV any other question 
p14607
aVmaybe someone from up above there 
p14608
aVyou re right there in the front 
p14609
aVcan you shout your question out 
p14610
aV i was wondering if physical ailments or health related physical ailments
p14611
aVcan be cured by or at least helped by yoga 
p14612
aV there are 
p14613
aVwe must understand  there are two kinds of ailments 
p14614
aVin the yogic system  we look at health issues as two ways 
p14615
aVone is caused by external organisms 
p14616
aVwhich i think modern medicine has handled in a phenomenal way 
p14617
aVin fact  the birth of modern medicine happened mainly
p14618
aVbecause of the epidemics and pandemics  which were happening at that time 
p14619
aVwhere it would wipe out populations 
p14620
aVit is that which inspired people to experiment
p14621
aVand do the things that they did 
p14622
aVand when they found solutions  that is when suddenly the 
p14623
aVthe trust of the population shifted from one to another 
p14624
aVsimply because they could eliminate epidemics
p14625
aVand these were caused by external organisms 
p14626
aVbut seventy percent of human ailments are on self help 
p14627
aVthat is  they cause it to themselves in so many ways 
p14628
aVfor whatever reasons  knowingly  unknowingly 
p14629
aVthey do it to themselves 
p14630
aVthis seventy percent of ailments that people cause to themselves
p14631
aVcan be undone from within 
p14632
aVbut if you have an infection 
p14633
aVyou must go to the doctor 
p14634
aVif you have pneumonia  you must immediately go to the doctor  
p14635
aVdon t try to do yoga  
p14636
aVnow  are there instances 
p14637
aVwe have thousands and thousands of people 
p14638
aVi would say hundreds and thousands of people 
p14639
aVwho walked out of their ailments
p14640
aVwithout ever being treated for them 
p14641
aVwe don t treat people for yoga 
p14642
aVi must tell you this because we are in a medical institution 
p14643
aVa bunch of doctors from united states came to our yoga center 
p14644
aVwe were 
p14645
aVwe have a yogic hospital 
p14646
aVso  about twelve of them 
p14647
aVlargely from this michigan area 
p14648
aVand they came and stayed for three days 
p14649
aVand on the fourth day  they were very upset and they wanted to leave 
p14650
aVi was very busy  i couldn t meet them
p14651
aVand somebody came and told me 
p14652
aV sadhguru  all these doctors are very upset  they want to go 
p14653
aVi said   what happened 
p14654
aV they are just very upset that there is no yogic hospital here 
p14655
aVyou told them there is yogic hospital  they think there is no yogic hospital 
p14656
aVthen i said   okay  let me see them   
p14657
aVthen i saw them 
p14658
aVthey were really upset 
p14659
aVthey were angry  they were f 
p14660
aVthey felt cheated that there is no yogic hospital here 
p14661
aVwhere are the patients 
p14662
aVwhere are the uniformed nurses and doctors walking up and down 
p14663
aVi said   see 
p14664
aVat that time  on that day  maybe there were over seventy patients 
p14665
aVbut i said   i thought i ll put them to good use
p14666
aVand i was making them work in the gardens   
p14667
aVnobody should ever understand sickness is a reward 
p14668
aVthey must want to get out of it as quickly as possible 
p14669
aVright now  we re treating patients in such a way 
p14670
aVpeople would want to be sick
p14671
aVwhenever they want attention 
p14672
aVnot just that 
p14673
aVone important part of the yogic treatment is 
p14674
aVwhat is called as bhuta shuddhi 
p14675
aVthis means syncing and purifying the elements within you 
p14676
ag14504
aVearth  water  air  fire and space 
p14677
aVthese five dimensions you can work on 
p14678
aVthis is the fundamentals of yoga 
p14679
aVso one of the most important thing is 
p14680
aVi want them barefoot  with open hands  to work in the garden 
p14681
aVto just get in touch with the earth 
p14682
aVbe outside 
p14683
aVget in touch with the air  water  earth 
p14684
aVhalf their ailments are gone 
p14685
aVtreatment is there little bit 
p14686
aVrest is all just connection with the world around
p14687
aVbecause this  is a composite of all these things 
p14688
aVyou remove yourself and keep yourself in a completely alien atmosphere 
p14689
aVwhere you re not in touch 
p14690
aVyou re four inches above the ground all the time  
p14691
aVyou will lose contact with what makes your life 
p14692
aVit s the very soil  which you re carrying as your body 
p14693
aVis it not important that it needs to be touched
p14694
aVwith its origins 
p14695
aVno  you re looking up 
p14696
aVno  your life happens from this planet 
p14697
aVthere are other dimensions to it  of course 
p14698
aVbut physical health and the physical nature around you
p14699
aVare very closely related 
p14700
aVif you don t connect them 
p14701
aVhealth is an accident for most people 
p14702
aVtoday  i see america probably has the highest incidents of allergies
p14703
aVis that so 
p14704
aVam i right 
p14705
aVvery high 
p14706
aVthis is mainly because they re removed from everything that s natural 
p14707
aVthey re not in touch with anything that is natural 
p14708
aVeverything is tampered with 
p14709
aVthose who are living in the open 
p14710
aVeven in america 
p14711
aVi m sure they have no allergy 
p14712
aVthey have no issue of any kind 
p14713
aVthey re doing fine 
p14714
aVi think the homeless people are the most healthy people in the end  
p14715
aVthey re enduring all kinds of you know  variations in weather
p14716
aVand still managing pretty well without healthcare  
p14717
aV we probably have time for one more question 
p14718
aVin the back  right there  shout it out 
p14719
aV how to look for internal peace 
p14720
aV how to 
p14721
ag14720
aV whoa  whoa 
p14722
aVyou just came in    
p14723
aV sorry 
p14724
aVwas that internal peace or eternal peace 
p14725
aV internal 
p14726
aV internal peace 
p14727
aV okay  now  
p14728
aVwe  we ve gone through this  anyway 
p14729
aVwhether it s peace  or happiness  or joy  or love or whatever 
p14730
aVit can only be internal 
p14731
aVit can t be external 
p14732
aVnow  there are many ways to address this 
p14733
aVbut one simple way is just this  
p14734
aVyou just have to learn where the keyboard is
p14735
aVfor this big computer of your mind 
p14736
aVright now  you don t know where the keyboard is 
p14737
aVyou re punching it somehow    something works 
p14738
ag13007
aVif you know where the keyboard is 
p14739
aVyou would type out the right things  isn t it 
p14740
aVfundamentally  it s just that your mind is not taking instructions from you 
p14741
aVdon t ask for peace 
p14742
aVdon t ask for joy 
p14743
aVdon t ask for love 
p14744
aVjust you have to understand the mechanics of
p14745
aVhow this body and this mind works 
p14746
aVand then you cause whatever you want 
p14747
aVif you like turmoil  cause it 
p14748
aVif you want love  cause it 
p14749
aVif you want hate  cause it  that s up to you 
p14750
aVbut i trust you  that if you are capable of causing pleasantness or unpleasantness within you 
p14751
aVyou will choose the highest form of pleasantness for yourself 
p14752
aVi trust you on that one 
p14753
aVnow that  you know  it started with this fifty four percent of doctors suffering 
p14754
aVwhich is unfortunate 
p14755
aVdoctors  all said and done  are rendering a very key aspect of service to any given society 
p14756
aVit s very important that they are well 
p14757
aVi  i would like to make this offering 
p14758
aVthat the doctors who are interested in this 
p14759
aVwe would like to offer them the tools of inner engineering 
p14760
aVso that they go out as truly healthy  joyful
p14761
aVlife which is full of vitality 
p14762
aVthat their very presence is an inspiration for health 
p14763
aVfor everybody who comes in touch with them 
p14764
aVthis must happen 
p14765
aVotherwise  what are we talking about health 
p14766
aVwe re talking medicine 
p14767
aVmedicine is a business 
p14768
aVhealth is an aspiration for every human being 
p14769
aVif this fundamental aspiration is not fulfilled 
p14770
aVyou cannot lead a human being to any other aspiration 
p14771
aVright now  there is some trouble in your body 
p14772
aVi will talk about enlightenment 
p14773
aVare you interested  i m asking 
p14774
ag13007
aVyour back is aching  i will talk enlightenment 
p14775
aVyou re not interested 
p14776
aV will my backache go 
p14777
aVthat s the only question  isn't it 
p14778
aVbecause body has this power 
p14779
aVunless you keep your body in such a way
p14780
aVthat you don t know whether it is here or not 
p14781
aVthis is what yoga means that your body becomes like breeze 
p14782
aVif you sit here  you don t know whether your body is here or not 
p14783
aVotherwise  if you sit here for one and a half hours 
p14784
aVyour body says   i must go to the bathroom 
p14785
aVyour body says   i must drink 
p14786
aVyour body says   i must do something 
p14787
aVbecause it is in a state of compulsive needs 
p14788
aVif you bring it to ease on all levels 
p14789
aVyou will not know whether body is here or not 
p14790
aVif you are in such a state 
p14791
aVyou re not even conscious whether it s here or not 
p14792
aVyou have no gender issues 
p14793
aVyou don t care whether you re a man or a woman right now 
p14794
ag13166
aVit should not matter  i m saying 
p14795
aVthere re only two places  where your gender should matter  
p14796
aVbathrooms and bedrooms  
p14797
aVnowhere else 
p14798
aV and some people even debate that 
p14799
aVwhich  you go to which bathroom  
p14800
aVit doesn t matter which bathroom 
p14801
aVso just it s the bedroom  
p14802
aV everything is under debate  
p14803
aVbut i m saying  to move the body from compulsive needs
p14804
aVto a place where it is like a stepping stone 
p14805
aVnot an impediment for your life
p14806
aVright now  the compulsiveness of the body is making people do all kinds of things in the world 
p14807
aVpeople are not able to raise to a place 
p14808
aVwhere they can do something other
p14809
aVthan the compulsive things that every other creature does 
p14810
aVsimply because they ve not kept their body as it should be kept 
p14811
aVthis body can be upgraded to a place 
p14812
aVwhere it will function like an antenna 
p14813
aVwhich will download the cosmos 
p14814
aVeven if that doesn t happen to you right now 
p14815
aVthe physicians of the world 
p14816
aVat least they must become an embodiment of health and vitality 
p14817
ag14765
aVwhatever is needed from our end 
p14818
aVwe re willing to do for yale and you sir  doolittle 
p14819
aV thank you so much 
p14820

aS'their waious kinds of professions'

aS'but particularly when people go to a doctor'

aS'in some way they re placing their life in his hands'

aS'somebody s willing to place their life in your hands'

aS'your own wife and children or husband is not willing to place of life in your hands comlitly'
p14923
ag14828
aS'but somebody an unknown person comes and places his life in your hands'

aS'i think its segretdisproviligethatsomebody trussyou at that level'

aS'that the willing to trust you with life'
p14926
aS'you could orecttingsoronthings'
p14927
aS'nongyfthamongly'
p14928
aS'because nobody has figured the human worry absolutely all right'
p14929
aS'a knowing to some extent'
p14930
aS'so you may do any number of wronpthings'
p14931
aS'but they placed their life into a hands '
p14932
aS'think'
p14933
aS'traditionally it was said like this in india '
p14934
aS'in an in society'
p14935
aS'if education'
p14936
aS'medicine'
p14937
aS'an spirtchilprocess '
p14938
aS'it gets commercialized '
p14939
aS'society will go down the drain'
p14940
aS'i think we re doing this and time modern world'
p14941
aS'all the and becoming commercialized'
p14942
aS'there s nothing wrong with commerce'
p14943
aS'commerce is a'
p14944
aS'a transaction of give take'
p14945
aS'you go in this ill give you that'
p14946
aS'but there are some things which cannot be handled as just give and take if you'
p14947
aS'bring this aspect of transaction into spiritual process'
p14948
aS'into education'
p14949
aS'and into medicine'
p14950
aS'then it turns ugly'
p14951
aS'and that ugliness will definitely burn or one were to other'
p14952
aS'of all what people are experiencing as burnout is first '
p14953
aS"or theyre doing something that they don't care for if the "
p14954
aS'genuinely doing something that they truly care for'
p14955
aS'there would be no but the '
p14956
aS'opportunity you get to do it the better '
p14957
aS"be isn'pie "
p14958
aS'thing is to words as erainend'
p14959
aS'the joy of doing what you re doing is not there in one s life'
p14960
aS'this is not just for any one profession it s for all professions but'
p14961
aS'pardiglatlyinaprfession like this'
p14962
aS'we its a question of life under for somebody else'
p14963
aS'when it s a question of life and death for the person who sitting in plant of you'
p14964
aS'it can be of trancection for you'
p14965
aS'well this is a business end to everything'
p14966
aS'because to make anything sustainable '
p14967
aS'has to be a business and god'
p14968
aS'we are not against the business end of it'
p14969
aS'but within yourself '
p14970
aS'so dont do it as a great offering to the person was sitting and tlentofew'
p14971
aS'of course they will pay their fee'
p14972
aS'but within yourself if you are not like this'
p14973
aS'definitely you will burnout doing this kind of work'
p14974
aS'otherwise every day if you help a person'
p14975
aS'if in some way you made somebody life the'
p14976
aS'better'
p14977
aS'the end of the day we should you be belompd into a joyful state'
p14978
aS'i should be in a state of burnout a band of the day'
p14979
aS'it should not be a on '
p14980
aS'if you generally expedients you have an hence many lives aa '
p14981
aS'this is not a out surveys '
p14982
aS'is not a our ideas of ysovethis i did this'
p14983
aS'no'
p14984
aS'there is a joy within a human being'
p14985
aS'when they re able to touch another life why'
p14986
aS'you are holding a few people dear to as family ease'
p14987
aS'because you believe you can touch their life in some way to be '
p14988
aS'difference that'
p14989
aS'what is most important for human being '
p14990
aS'in every activity that we perform'
p14991
aS'waanitie of the activity'
p14992
aS'how profoundly we can put somewhere else'
p14993
aS'this is what makes the big difference'
p14994
aS'if you make a movie'
p14995
aS"you don't want to make a more way which nobody wants to watch would you"
p14996
aS"you want people to watch this movie and come to tears isn't it "
p14997
aS'you know an a billahouse that nobody wants to live in'
p14998
aS'you do want to cook something that nobody wants to eat'
p14999
aS'these things you can do only because '
p15000
aS'some way you are able to touch another life pro activity'
p15001
aS'this is most fundamental need within the human being'
p15002
aS'and as a physician'
p15003
aS'you have a phenomenon opportunity of touching lives like very other'
p15004
aS'very few other professions can do'
p15005
aS'and this was not live to burn up '
p15006
aS'this is happening so because'
p15007
aS'leatlaingpocreated like a transaction'
p15008
aS'and the most fundamental thing that we have not understood in this process '
p15009
aS'that human experience is can caused from within'
p15010
aS'not from outside '
p15011
aS'your joy and misery'
p15012
aS'open and gleishure'
p15013
aS'you are a banana'

aS'if you try to fix it by fixing what is around you'
p15018
aS'gobombcersinnotime'
p15019
aS'i am surprised why only fifty four percent '
p15020
aS'because if you don t understand human experience is caused from millin'
p15021
aS'especially medical professionals who'
p15022
aS'in some way have dealt into the nature of human visioli'
p15023
aS'and i believe to some extent the mind we must'
p15024
aS'or that every aspect of human experience comes from gileno'
p15025
aS'and '
p15026
aS'modern medicine is '
p15027
aS'unlike the traditional made'
p15028
aS'is entirely camimefixes for everyting'
p15029
aS'so you understand that both held a illness is happening because of cheese'
p15030
aS'joy and misery is a certain chemistry'
p15031
aS'if in taps of cimmistry'
p15032
aS'he s in agony are different tabpsofchimmistry'
p15033
aS'or in other words we are a chemical soup '
p15034
aS'the question is '

p15086
aS'which includes your thought your emotion everything'
p15087
aS'to put this very simply'
p15088
aS'it amazes me that people are twenty thirty fifty sixty years of age'

p15097
aS'just because everybody is in the same kind'
p15098
aS'so he does not become normal '
p15099
aS'so essentially'
p15100
aS'you are'
p15101
aS'you have made a choice of dealing with people'
p15102
aS'who are sick or dying '
p15103
aS'it is a juice '
p15104
aS'and it is a privilege that those who unwell'
p15105
aS'being unwelmins'
p15106
aS'you are no more hundred percent on your feet'
p15107
aS'you need somebody help'
p15108
aS'such people'
p15109
aS'and those who are dying in some way'
p15110
aS'they re willing to trust you on put their life and to '
p15111
aS'to great pilege '
p15112
aS'in this'
p15113
aS'there are many things to do '
p15114
aS'you were exam'
p15115
aS'said you have to convey something and lets in for somebody'
p15116
aS'sometimes you are not able to see them '
p15117
aS'i see this you have no time'
p15118
aS'or they have no money or whatever '
p15119
aS'is it there'
p15120
aS'i m not qustninglis'
p15121
aS'but the most important aspect of the '
p15122
aS'if you want to bring well being to somebody'
p15123
aS"you must know how to be well isn't it"
p15124
aS'to lewis how wontutoattarmask'
p15125
aS'how'
p15126
aS'how would you be create well being to someone'
p15127
aS'when you do not know how to be well'
p15128
aS'what this implies is'
p15129
aS'if i have to be well the world has to be perfect'
p15130
aS'well you not going to be well '
p15131
aS'because even if you re just two people in the family'
p15132
aS'not everything happens the way you think it should happen isn t it '
p15133
ag2415
aS'who can tell me to '
p15134
aS'even if you just to people'
p15135
aS'not everything will ever happen to you hundred percent the way you want it'
p15136
aS'fifty one percent if its happening you '
p15137
aS'you have the controlling stake anything'
p15138
aS'if you expect you have a does '
p15139
aS'it '
p15140
aS'so outtidewenever happen hundred percent the way you want it'
p15141
aS'or in other words'
p15142
aS'if you expect the outside to be hundred percent the way you want it'
p15143
aS'you just not equipped to live here in this water as a '
p15144
ag15065
aS'expecting tags external situations deal and it percent my way'
p15145
aS'obviously i m not equipped to live in this world'
p15146
aS'we are a wolentyeroganization'
p15147
aS'or four thousand full time willing'
p15148
aS'so it to a milandpartanvolantes'
p15149
aS'every day somebody is coming up to me is '
p15150
aS'do i cant take her in a my contticit'
p15151
aS'this person i can work with this person'
p15152
aS'this man is like this this woman is like that'
p15153
aS'i tell them'
p15154
aS'see this is the kind of people that exist in the world if you'
p15155
aS'what you re doing is at a significant '
p15156
aS'work with these people '
p15157
aS'there '
p15158
aS'you want to work with ideal people'
p15159
aS'you must go to heaven and today '
p15160
aS'these are our realities'
p15161
aS'if you truly see gene '
p15162
aS'what i m doing is significant'
p15163
aS'it oh significant if'
p15164
aS'ignliicantenoftomake difference in lives around me'
p15165
aS'now you have to do that work'
p15166
aS'the problem is not of the nature of your work'
p15167
aS'but is to ask anybody from the topmost job down to the most menial job'
p15168
aS'everybody complains about stress'
p15169
aS'so stress is not about your job '
p15170
aS'tell this '
p15171
aS'to usable many as a '
p15172
aS'fast came to united states'
p15173
aS'wherever i went people were talking about stress management'
p15174
aS"i couldn't understand this"
p15175
aS'because in my understanding'
p15176
aS'we manage whatever is precious to us '
p15177
aS'family or we owe business a money'
p15178
aS'why would anybody want to manage stress '
p15179
aS'it took me a while to understand people have'
p15180
aS'concluded that stress is a part of their life'
p15181
aS'stress is not a part of your life'
p15182
aS'he suggestiourinabbiity to manage your own to'
p15183
aS'eelonamolshonyouroenitiesandorownbody '
p15184
ag14984
aS'if your mind took instructions from you'
p15185
aS'would you live in stress or in bliss'
p15186
aS'is to'
p15187
ag2415
aS'is'
p15188
aS'yes'
p15189
aS'so a simple thing is not happening because'
p15190
aS'your mind is not even digging instructions from you'
p15191
aS'if you are in verliinstans against you who the hancansiru'
p15192
aS'so this anxiety this stress is not about the job'
p15193
aS'it is just that'
p15194
aS'our education systems are such'
p15195
aS'they are telling you how to conquer the world you know'
p15196
aS'how to break an invisible atom'
p15197
aS'how to go beyond space'
p15198
aS'but did not telling you a thing about this one'
p15199
aS'is the most complex'
p15200
aS'the showanderqolitahumanmecanismth'
p15201
aS'the most complex and sofasticatedmacimachanismyouhaveseen'
p15202
ag15189
aS'yes as a doctor you '
p15203
ag14984
aS'but i m asking'
p15204
aS'even the doctors'
p15205
aS'had a day the led the uses manual'
p15206
aS'how to use this'
p15207
aS'nothing'
p15208
aS'just by accident something'
p15209
aS'when you live by accident'
p15210
aS'anxieties natural '
p15211
aS'so i was really interested in the title of your i '
p15212
aS'in her egedering'
p15213
aS'but you is guide to joy'
p15214
aS'and those are some words that you don t usually see often so close together i in '
p15215
aS'engineering i enjoy '
p15216
ag14840
aS'you '
p15217
aS'here are a a '
p15218
aS'and the older '
p15219
aS'and sonerinyoeyonow '
p15220
aS'i like that word engineering '
p15221
aS'and you need to know there are some really '
p15222
aS'some of the tieeginearsattheuniversyartheiy'
p15223
aS'yesterday was the end '
p15224
aS'there yes '
p15225
aS'a world engineers day '
p15226
aS'so what '
p15227
aS'as the them '
p15228
aS'so what would you say is the message of '
p15229
aS'so inkourgananha'
p15230
aS'inner engineering'
p15231
aS'you ve is gone '
p15232
aS'well it does that and '
p15233
aS'see '
p15234
aS'so if you and me were here let the hundred years ago '
p15235
aS'at two hundred years sigl '
p15236
aS'the word was and how it is to '
p15237
aS'it is almost another world'
p15238
aS"it's not the same "
p15239
aS'you wouldn t have recognized it that s how much it dischanged'
p15240
aS'what changed this'
p15241
aS'or i believe to engineer extra not situations the way we want '
p15242
aS'we could sit outside and do this'
p15243
aS'but now we re sitting in this building because this is engineered for our comfort'
p15244
aS'now engineering essentially means'
p15245
aS'making something just a way we want it '
p15246
aS'everything in the world the way we want it'
p15247
aS'but now fifty four qestendbonot'
p15248
aS'because we did not make this one thing the way we want it '
p15249
aS'if we made this one thing the way we want it '
p15250
aS'and the same curschin'
p15251
aS'live blissfully or miserably'
p15252
aS'if you made this the way you want it you would'
p15253
aS'definitely make this misfl '
p15254
aS'level of pleasantness for yourself'
p15255
aS'what you want for your neighbor may be debatable but what'
p15256
aS'for yourself is very clear esentit'
p15257
aS'so this is not happening because'
p15258
aS'we have never approached in a well being in a scintoficmanner'
p15259
aS'we are thinking something else from somewhere is going to fix this'
p15260
aS'if you want to be well we looked up'
p15261
aS'in india they call it a perwallo'
p15262
aS'aminsetofonabal'
p15263
aS'i m saying'
p15264
aS'is it true that you are living on a round planet hello'
p15265
aS'the '
p15266
aS'tovounplanetthadweaelivingon'
p15267
aS'and unmtapofhitdids spinning '
p15268
aS'if you look up you re inrelibly looking up in the wrong direction '
p15269
aS'and the '
p15270
aS'you must go to australia to look up the right way '
p15271
aS'saying we are simply even incapable of knowing what is up and i am in the genius'
p15272
aS'is it some we walk an thiscos'
p15273
aS'must decide up'
p15274
aS"we not only do not know we cannot know res'tit"
p15275
aS'so vidondivannorwhich is up which is down'
p15276
aS'we do not know what is forward what is backward'
p15277
aS'we really do not know what is east what is west for '
p15278
aS'is we made up things'
p15279
aS'but it is one thing that you can know red '
p15280
aS'it is a perspective'
p15281
aS'there is inward and there is outward'
p15282
aS'we have been just busy fixing the outside'
p15283
aS'you fix the outside as much as you want all '
p15284
aS'get is comfort and convenience'
p15285
aS'you will not get well by'
p15286
aS'if weling has to happen'
p15287
aS'you have to engineer you into our de the way you want it '
p15288
aS'and this it becomes the way you want'
p15289
aS'now this will be joyful'
p15290
aS'if our time becomes the way i want they will become foot '
p15291
aS'have to admit this'
p15292
aS'now before in the history of humanity'
p15293
aS'any other generation knew the kind of comforts and convenient'
p15294
aS'that you and me i enjoyed right '
p15295
aS'i sutnl '
p15296
ag2415
aS'we '
p15297
aS'the most comfortable denervition ever i '
p15298
aS'whining like crazy '
p15299
aS'so lets take a a the interlign and the owolf '
p15300
aS'one thing that strikes me as so powerful about so mission in the world is '
p15301
aS'you seem to a sucatiliroertothofthose '
p15302
aS'so bro you must take off the word broker'
p15303
ag14840
aS'i say '
p15304
aS'i sustasilyahpursuedbotofthose werealso '
p15305
ag15217
aS'is a vaationatyufisisteyunynplanstrees'
p15306
aS'and then you also teach be more a about inner engineering'
p15307
aS'and i think that could be jaungefor '
p15308
aS'we in the west'
p15309
aS'we in the west perhaps love the '
p15310
aS'i may at the expense as the inermeral '
p15311
aS'i love to hear your metal '
p15312
aS'see all this a massive projects of help'
p15313
aS'education and ecology that we re doing in southern india how '
p15314
aS'i happened only because of an inner experience'
p15315
aS'the millions of people or had a powerful in the experience it'
p15316
aS'of that were a will to generate this action'
p15317
aS'because these massive projects are all completely done by a waluncerforce'
p15318
aS'while enters means '
p15319
aS'nobody s trained for the job this is a '
p15320
ag14828
aS'and you cannot fire them for inefficiency of the wall '
p15321
aS'at the same time'
p15322
aS'even if their honingakeepos '
p15323
aS'at any time without notisedicanjustlanes'
p15324
aS'you manage an organization like this you go crazy in no time '
p15325
aS'as it up i do '
p15326
aS'having disglab my job'
p15327
aS'it is a sure route to madness '
p15328
aS'if i was not as well as a list i am within myself'
p15329
aS'it wolavedoenmeboners'
p15330
aS'is our managed businesses before '
p15331
aS'and at that time i '
p15332
aS'we met authority and people to get things going '
p15333
aS'and the main thing was they were on my'
p15334
aS'in a'
p15335
aS'i was doing the payment for them '
p15336
aS'a man control '
p15337
aS"now i don't make any pemint for anybody"
p15338
aS'everybody is not paid '
p15339
aS'is paid'
p15340
aS'in fact they spend it all money and come and do everything'
p15341
aS'to get them going is essensirly the inner engineering'
p15342
aS'because there is a powerful experience within '
p15343
aS'which drives them to do all this work'
p15344
aS'it is '
p15345
aS'unfortunate that people always trying to do wide the world'
p15346
aS'you must understand this'
p15347
aS'that the very basic nature of human intellect is this'
p15348
aS'human intellect you know all of you the '
p15349
aS'it is the better it is sent at all'
p15350
aS'you hold egivitmer'
p15351
aS'so the shaper is the better it is i think intellect '
p15352
aS'i asslywantotalkaboutbeanomprot '
p15353
aS'and one with that forelitterandotprojectti'
p15354
aS'so the '
p15355
aS'because one of the things is a vawiahsir '
p15356
aS'linefulloftheitteryfe'
p15357
aS'you can'
p15358
aS'manfulloftheintatlife'
p15359
aS'now you talked about being a prophet '
p15360
aS'antenna'
p15361
aS'so then i '
p15362
aS'i i i cesourrihav '
p15363
aS'wtodaerisanaaloro'
p15364
ag15048
aS'and in the yroviaholeinheojestythereare'
p15365
aS'there is the role of those who speed trustehow'
p15366
aS'tea against injustice'
p15367
aS'who a sacrifice themselves for a cause because of injustice'
p15368
aS'and there in that herituve'
p15369
aS'there is an and there is rage '
p15370
aS'there are segnetadhingroszofpemoein '
p15371
aS'all in our hand '
p15372
aS'who has a do gostheanabahweral'
p15373
aS'on the rain the '

p15377
aS'robuyinpecewithinoneself '
p15378
aS'the other side of that one'
p15379
aS'so what is the '
p15380
aS'a time to be all'
p15381
aS'to that is a march'
p15382
aS'to be in ray at the injustice of the world'
p15383
aS'how would you say i said that'
p15384
aS'in a chat and now you this is not'
p15385
aS'poplofname in a maker'
p15386
aS'tegriaveroseadif you re engrade your one has '

aS'so if you are out of rage you on us '
p15388
aS'i should really out of rage'
p15389
aS'definitely one of us '
p15390
aS'you think there is a reason for your in'
p15391
aS'which is a wrong perception'
p15392
aS'if you look at it'
p15393
aS'people get terribly angry with a loud ones'
p15394
aS'all on wilancewithinthe homes'
p15395
aS'as they get tetoblly angry with their lodone'
p15396
aS'somebody to delivinwept '
p15397
aS'have a good reason to get angry'
p15398
aS'because she did not cook the breakfast properly on the'
p15399
aS"dogpedwhereit's not supposed to be"
p15400
aS'i have seen people yelling and screaming and breaking their clubs on a golf course where the'
p15401
aS'having a good time '
p15402
aS'saying everybody has a reason to be angry'
p15403
aS'anger means just this'
p15404
aS'when your any as a '
p15405
aS'the you know today that when you re angry'
p15406
aS'lipily you generating poison in the system'
p15407
aS'italy'
p15408
aS'poisoning yourself internally'
p15409
aS'and when you re angry'
p15410
aS'you know you do the most tydortithinks in your life'
p15411
aS'when you turn back and see you can t believe you did it'
p15412
aS"but most yderticthings happen when you're angry"
p15413
aS'so i m asking '
p15414
ag14829
aS'anger an intelligent expression of human life'
p15415
aS'or a nedeorticexpression of human life'
p15416
aS'hello '
p15417
aS'i do '
p15418
aS'to the toloeetoknow '
p15419
aS'the next time you re angry you just know you re stupid '
p15420
aS'because you re turning against yourself'
p15421
aS'but'
p15422
aS'i i tell the reason'
p15423
aS'this anger has been eagistd ease'
p15424
aS'in a moment of anger'
p15425
aS'some people who were sleeping all their life propelled themselves into action'
p15426
aS'and that action produced some results'
p15427
aS'yes that can happen'
p15428
aS'it may so happen in all'
p15429
aS'that if i throw a stone at you'
p15430
aS'is of hitting you'
p15431
aS'it hit the appolinetry and the happolfellinyourhans'
p15432
aS'but that we axcolent '
p15433
aS'denderlyfitrowastol'
p15434
aS'your head we track'
p15435
aS'what is supposed to happen '
p15436
ag2415
aS'so i got angry and something got done'
p15437
aS'so i think anger is a great way of doing things'
p15438
aS'so when you re angry you yell and you are somebody '
p15439
aS'asking all issue'
p15440
aS'how many of you enjoy being yelled at and fumed by somebody else'
p15441
aS'here the i '

aS'your wife '
p15444
aS'parents said anybody'

aS'of '
p15447
aS'did you '
p15448
ag2415
aS'no '

aS'hello'
p15683
ag14828
aS'i am saying do you believe that people who lived here thousandersil'
p15684
aS'what such huporsilperedhuman being'
p15685
aS'they did everything perfectly and you re doing everything wrong'
p15686
aS'not a'
p15687
aS'devereontoduspeoplelike you'
p15688
aS'we have a way of elodizing ever'
p15689
aS'thing with which we have a certain distance of time '
p15690
aS'are they of no all you '
p15691
aS'not true'
p15692
aS'that a whole lot of things '
p15693
aS'lot of things that '
p15694
aS'we as human being simplynoberday'
p15695
aS'bites thanks to the traditions in bitrehodonap'
p15696
aS'we can not in all'
p15697
aS'but if you wonder not this life it as myself'
p15698
aS'no tradition is'
p15699
aS'i can inspire you'
p15700
aS'peitiancan put you in a delecti'
p15701
aS'tradition cannot take you there'
p15702
aS'because this has to happen now to you only then it s a living reality for you'
p15703
aS'otherwise you will read in a book and believe it'
p15704
aS'but how do you know this works'
p15705
aS'i am saying it should work people'
p15706
aS'he said '
p15707
aS'how do we know whether we have met a real teacher on a boodowarnot'
p15708
aS'i just tell them'
p15709
aS'look at his face whether it s worked for him what he s talking '
p15710
aS'has it worked for him'
p15711
aS'the question'
p15712
aS"if it will tell him it doesn't matter what"
p15713
aS'you must go at him because his work for him'
p15714
aS'if it s not worked for him what is the point'
p15715
aS'dead tradition'
p15716
aS'so one of the traditions here in a man '
p15717
aS'westerlusall'
p15718
aS'is the traditional of the as'
p15719
ag14840
ag14829
aS'only li may be two or three hundred years old'
p15720
aS'the ranomyseenoltrial'
p15721
aS'coorstedytherolive'
p15722
aS"it's good "
p15723
aS"that's how i got sures or you know no "
p15724
aS'troistehotelevieapain'
p15725
aS'so another this persuesoltheevistat '
p15726
aS'he has '
p15727
ag14828
aS'only a embrace the life of the spirit'
p15728
aS'and and the truth that we find in our faith raises and i love'
p15729
aS'a true'
p15730
aS'it s a reognicehattentionyewlobe'
p15731
aS'be the truth'
p15732
aS'that we discover in the lab at the truth '
p15733
aS'to discover a in our '
p15734
aS'and a i i a '
p15735
aS'i think that is as a grave oh i said granwayaliinawa '
p15736
aS'sort of my a joy all or so'
p15737
aS'is both the true that i see around me and a lie rose in my heart'
p15738
aS'i do reonezehentene'
p15739
aS'who is your porseinthad'
p15740
aS'so when my talk about the evidence based approach'
p15741
aS'it is not a tradition'
p15742
aS'when it happened'
p15743
aS'when that anyone happened it was breaking of all taditions'
p15744
aS'till then because it was written in a book'
p15745
aS'because a ceddinatolity was espousing it'
p15746
aS'with a visisit '
p15747
aS'when medical signs i walk from jenner to others'
p15748
aS'the fundamental thing was they era all tradition'
p15749
aS'so now if that is becoming a tradition'
p15750
aS'i am very sorry'
p15751
aS'because this was an exploration'
p15752
aS'an exploration cannot be traditional'
p15753
aS'an exploration means you re constantly trying to step into new tellana'
p15754
aS'that s what an exploration is'
p15755
aS'but if that has become traditional'
p15756
aS'then we are treading the same track and thinking it s exploration this'
p15757
aS'evidence based approach has done wonders to many many things'
p15758
aS'not quesionsion'
p15759
aS'but this entire process is dependent upon the human intellect'
p15760
aS'a who re just coming to '
p15761
aS'i went off a little bit '
p15762
aS'human intellect by nature '
p15763
aS'i was just asking'
p15764
aS'would you like a charporbloct'
p15765
aS'hello you wnderedchapl'
p15766
aS'if you have a sharp entmantletser you have a knife in your hand'
p15767
aS'what could you know with this flower'
p15768
aS'with a knife '
p15769
aS'and i finally if you want me to'
p15770
aS'a cut it into pieces'
p15771
aS'thats exactly what the intellect us'
p15772
aS'whatever you give it it will cut it open and tried to see the '
p15773
aS'of evidence based science is disection fundamentally '
p15774
aS'well even in the medical school i m sure'
p15775
ag15297
aS'the paolity labs we are opening up'
p15776
aS'fortunately the dead '
p15777
aS'but if you really want to know somebody'
p15778
aS'someone whom you love very much '
p15779
aS'who really want to know them '
p15780
aS'think you should dissect them to know that'
p15781
aS'what it looks like that'
p15782
aS'no obviously'
p15783
aS'so there is one dimension of like'
p15784
aS'which is physical in nature'
p15785
aS'red dysectionwilwolke'
p15786
aS'but what is physical about you'
p15787
aS'body of the two cat is a '
p15788
aS'comilation that you gathered over a bit of time'
p15789
aS'a food the oveton '
p15790
aS'ulipiesof the planet most'
p15791
aS"i don't get this when they re walking"
p15792
aS'but the countless number of people who walked on this planet before you and me'
p15793
aS'they are on top site '
p15794
aS'you and me also will be topsoil'
p15795
aS'unless your friends choose to bury you real deep '
p15796
aS'fearing that you may rise from the dead'
p15797
aS'this is just the soil is at ip'
p15798
ag2415
ag2415
aS'this is just the soil that you walk upon'
p15799
aS'so this is an ehimently'
p15800
aS'what you gather'
p15801
aS'what you accumulate '
p15802
aS'a plan it is mine'
p15803
aS"you cannot say it's me isn't it"
p15804
aS'right now i am speaking'
p15805
aS'i said this is my glass'
p15806
aS'you would think'
p15807
aS'or so the gilsems to have a problem'
p15808
aS'but lets listen everybody says his wife'
p15809
aS'after some time i so this is me'
p15810
aS'then you will telletico '
p15811
aS'as if i claim this is me you know it is'
p15812
aS'it qualifies for madness these '
p15813
aS'whatever you acquire'
p15814
aS'you can say this is mine'
p15815
aS'but if you say this is me this is madness'
p15816
aS'yes son'
p15817
aS'i had any saecettwish '
p15818
aS'to this '
p15819
aS'this qualify '
p15820
ag2415
aS'so every day you re doing this'
p15821
aS'food appeared on your plate you said this is my food'
p15822
aS'you ate and then you say to me'
p15823
aS'this is my best'
p15824
aS'but you have enormous company '
p15825
aS'and we believe in democracy'
p15826
aS'whenever the madority safe must be like'
p15827
aS'so it is going on'
p15828
aS'but the moment you believe something that is not you as yourself'
p15829
aS'you can lost it '
p15830
aS'you would be a a from life'
p15831
aS'so turning inward does not mean dissection'
p15832
aS'turning inward does not mean contemplation'
p15833
aS'because the content of your body'
p15834
aS'and the content of your mind is an ecamelytosubstetse isnt '

aS'changes that are happening in the society'
p15934
aS'otherwise how a mother should deal with the child'
p15935

p16785
aVon this guru poornima 
p16786
aVmy best wishes and blessings to all of you 
p16787
aVthe significance of this day 
p16788
aVin terms of exploring human possibilities 
p16789
aVis unparalleled
p16790
aVbecause it s on this day a little over 15 000 years ago 
p16791
aVthat adiyogi
p16792
aVfor the first time chose to turn himself
p16793
aVinto a means of transmission 
p16794
aVtransmitting a dimension which was unheard of till then 
p16795
aVpredating all religion 
p16796
aVpredating all ideologies 
p16797
aVfor the first time 
p16798
aVhe brought this possibility into human life that
p16799
aVif you are willing to strive 
p16800
ag16800
aVyou can cross all the limitations that have been set upon you
p16801
aVby your own means or by nature 
p16802
aVyou can transcend all this if you are willing to strive 
p16803
aVhe not only said this 
p16804
aVhe not only opened up this possibility 
p16805
aVhe expounded the entire science and technologies
p16806
aVand various methods and practices
p16807
aVthrough which an individual human being can rise beyond all limitations 
p16808
aVthe idea of transcendence
p16809
aVonly happened on this day 
p16810
aVthe idea of transcendence was first brought into
p16811
aVto the human race only on this day 
p16812
aVso this day has always been celebrated
p16813
aVas one of the most significant days
p16814
aVfor those who are aspiring to be something more than who they are right now 
p16815
aVtell me one person
p16816
aVwho is not aspiring to be something more than what he or she is right now 
p16817
aVit is just that
p16818
aVeach person is aspiring to be something more
p16819
aVwithin the limitations of what they know 
p16820
aVone person s idea of something more may be money 
p16821
aVanother person s idea of something more may be wealth 
p16822
aVanother person s idea of something more may be knowledge 
p16823
aVlove 
p16824
aVpleasure 
p16825
aVbut there is no human being
p16826
aVwho is not aspiring to be something more than what they are right now 
p16827
aVthe aspiration is universal 
p16828
aVthe currency employed for this aspiration may be of various kinds 
p16829
aVnow the question is  
p16830
aVhow many who aspire for this something more 
p16831
aVrealize that more is not going to fulfill this being  
p16832
aVif you get that something more that you are aspiring for today 
p16833
aVtomorrow you will aspire for something more 
p16834
aVif that happens  something more
p16835
aVbecause this  is not aspiring for more 
p16836
aVthis is aspiring for all 
p16837
aVso he brought this awareness to start with 
p16838
aVwith the seven sages who gathered around him 
p16839
aVtoday  they are celebrated in this country as sapta rishis
p16840
aVand they in turn brought it to humanity in so many different ways 
p16841
aVthe significance of the day is that 
p16842
aVthat it is a shift
p16843
aVit is the first full moon day after the shifting of the solstice 
p16844
aVthis time 
p16845
aVcertain calendar adjustments have moved it to the second 
p16846
aVbut normally it is the first full moon day 
p16847
aVit is also a time when the sun begins to move southward in relation
p16848
aVwith this planet on which we are 
p16849
aVso  it is also a time 
p16850
aVwhich is a time
p16851
aVwhich is best for receiving grace for variety of reasons 
p16852
aVso  this day was one day 
p16853
aVwhich was universally celebrated in this part of the world at one time 
p16854
aVthis system of celebrating guru poornima
p16855
aVand becoming available to grace
p16856
aVgot dislocated only after the british took over
p16857
aVand made sure that you have to go to office on that day  
p16858
aVso  this grand celebration that used to happen across the country
p16859
aVin this entire region  not just in india
p16860
aVkind of got little dislocated
p16861
aVbecause it is a day when you have to go to work 
p16862
aVso things got disturbed 
p16863
aVbut still 
p16864
aVin this country at least 
p16865
aVstill millions and millions of people are conscious that
p16866
aVthis is a day of grace 
p16867
aVthis is a day they can easily become available to grace
p16868
aVand hence it s lived on 
p16869
aVa time has come in the history of humanity 
p16870
aVwhere our ability to do things in the outside world
p16871
aVhas almost become superhuman 
p16872
aVwhen i say superhuman 
p16873
aVi want you to understand 
p16874
aVa thousand years ago or even a hundred years ago 
p16875
aVwhat an individual human being could do
p16876
aVand what an individual human being can do today 
p16877
aVsimply because of the aid of science and technology 
p16878
aVis literally superhuman 
p16879
aVi am sure a hundred years ago 
p16880
aVif you pulled out something from your pocket and spoke to somebody in america right now 
p16881
aVpeople would definitely think you are superhuman or more 
p16882
aVbelieve me 
p16883
aVif you had a cellphone hundred years ago 
p16884
aVyou could have claimed you re god
p16885
aVand they would have believed it 
p16886
aVyou just got your phones too late  
p16887
aVso  once humanity is empowered like this on various levels 
p16888
aVit s extremely important that
p16889
aVraising of human consciousness becomes of paramount importance 
p16890
aVand raising of human consciousness essentially means this 
p16891
aVthat your longing to expand 
p16892
aVwanting to be something more
p16893
aVyou find a vehicle through which you can expand limitlessly 
p16894
aVso  adiyogi on this day transmitted
p16895
aVone hundred and twelve ways
p16896
aVin which one can expand limitlessly 
p16897
aVhundred and twelve ways  
p16898
aVenough variety for you  
p16899
aVif you don t like one  you can pick the other  
p16900
aVone hundred and twelve ways in which you can attain to a limitless expansion 
p16901
aVso  here we are on this day
p16902
aVand i am supposed to hang out  
p16903
aVwhen we generally say hangout we mean just 
p16904
aVit s a gossipy session 
p16905
aVso no problem 
p16906
aVbecause when it comes to inner dimensions 
p16907
aVyou can only gossip because 
p16908
aVyou cannot talk about it 
p16909
aVyou can only talk around it 
p16910
aVso  we can only gossip 
p16911
aVso  it s appropriate  we just hanging out with you 
p16912
aVplease
p16913
aV the very first question in our google hangout session is
p16914
aVfrom an online participant called cyrus from maryland  usa 
p16915
aVand cyrus  question sadhguru is
p16916
aVthat many people firmly believe that people do not require a guru to become enlightened 
p16917
aVrather  they believe that the power to become enlightened lies within us
p16918
aVand is within our control 
p16919
aVis it realistic to think that we can achieve enlightenment without a guru 
p16920
aV in maryland 
p16921
aVnow 
p16922
aVif we have to learn something as simple as abc  alphabets 
p16923
aVtwenty six only in english language  
p16924
aVsamskrit  has fifty four 
p16925
aVtamil has two hundred odd 
p16926
aVtwenty six only 
p16927
aVtwenty six alphabets 
p16928
aVhow many of you believe that
p16929
aVif you did not have a teacher 
p16930
aVyou would have learnt these twenty six alphabets 
p16931
aVthat s the answer   
p16932
aVand especially if you want to walk an uncharted path 
p16933
aVnew terrain 
p16934
aVif you go into new terrain 
p16935
aVit is sensible to take instructions  believe me 
p16936
aVotherwise 
p16937
aVyou could try an adventure
p16938
aVbut even those who adventure 
p16939
aVthese days use a gps 
p16940
aVearlier  they used maps or they listened to the locals 
p16941
aVthose who do not want to listen to another human being who has already walked the terrain
p16942
aVand think they can do it by themselves
p16943
aVnothing wrong 
p16944
aVi am not saying they cannot  they can  why not 
p16945
aVafter all  you are only trying to walk the inner territory 
p16946
aVit s just that
p16947
aVwhat you could do in a short span of time 
p16948
aVyou may do it in a million years 
p16949
aVif i ask you
p16950
aVi think almost all of you are wearing a watch 
p16951
aVthis is not some rocket science 
p16952
aVjust a watch 
p16953
aVthey have been ticking around for hundreds of years now 
p16954
aVi will give you all the parts of this watch 
p16955
aVdismantle and give it to you 
p16956
aVput it together  let me see 
p16957
aVno  no 
p16958
aVi am not asking you to manufacture a watch 
p16959
aVit s all there 
p16960
aVwe ll dismantle it and give it to you 
p16961
aVput it together let me see 
p16962
aVwe will give you a manual  how to do it 
p16963
aVplease do it and see  let me see 
p16964
aVyou will have a watch but you won t tick  
p16965
aVsimilarly on the spiritual path 
p16966
aVwithout guidance you want to go  
p16967
aVall the best  
p16968
aVno problem 
p16969
aVit s just that unnecessary 
p16970
aVunnecessary hardship you will create for yourself 
p16971
aVif you like it the hard way   fine 
p16972
aVwhat s the problem 
p16973
aVsome people like suffering 
p16974
aVthey think nothing good can come out of life unless you suffer 
p16975
aVif you are
p16976
aVif you are that kind  it s all right 
p16977
aVbut my intention
p16978
aVmy intention is people should walk this path blissfully 
p16979
aVjoyfully  
p16980
aVecstatic if it s possible  
p16981
aVif you want to go on a tour joyfully 
p16982
aVbetter to go on a guided tour 
p16983
aVbelieve me  
p16984
aVplease 
p16985
aV our next question is from the international cricketing legend
p16986
aVand well loved indian batsman virender sehwag  
p16987
aV oh  he speaks with his bat  
p16988
aVit s a technology issue 
p16989
aVit s not him  okay  
p16990
aV i m afraid i will have to read the question while we sort out the audio issue 
p16991
aVthe question is  
p16992
aVwhy don t people just share their knowledge sadhguru 
p16993
aVwhy do they withhold it 
p16994
aVwhy don t they share it the way you do 
p16995
aV oh 
p16996
aVthis is the age of intellectual property  
p16997
aVsomebody even wants to patent yogasanas 
p16998
aVyou can patent the asana
p16999
aVbut still you can t get into it  
p17000
aVyou may have patented all the difficult asanas
p17001
aVbut can you get into it   that s the question 
p17002
aVso  we have come to a place in the world 
p17003
aVwhere everything is monetized 
p17004
aVeverything has a commercial angle to it 
p17005
aVso  because of that 
p17006
aVas people have been miserly with money 
p17007
aVnow they are miserly with knowledge 
p17008
aVbecause you know  knowledge is money 
p17009
aVso they are miserly with that because it s money in some way 
p17010
aVso  this monetizing of everything can really destroy many things in this world 
p17011
aVin this culture  we always fixed it like this  
p17012
aVspiritual process 
p17013
aVhealth related things
p17014
aVand education 
p17015
aVthese three things should never be commercialized 
p17016
aVeverything else can be commercialized 
p17017
aVthese three things should always be offered  
p17018
aVthe question is only about the qualification of the recipient 
p17019
aVall kinds of people come and say 
p17020
aV i want to go 
p17021
aVi want to do this 
p17022
aVi want to do that 
p17023
aVtwo days later  they won't be here 
p17024
aVso  the question is only about the qualifications of the recipient 
p17025
aVif that one thing is ensured 
p17026
aVknowledge should be offered
p17027
aVirrespective of commercial interests that are involved in it 
p17028
aVbut today  everything is commercialized
p17029
aVand in many ways  you can t help it
p17030
aVbecause the whole momentum is in that direction 
p17031
aVvirender may be willing to share his knowledge 
p17032
aVhe may teach ten different people
p17033
aVhow to hold the bat 
p17034
aVhow to hit the ball 
p17035
aVhow to stand 
p17036
aVhow to do this 
p17037
aVhow to do that 
p17038
aVbut how many will go about scoring double centuries after double centuries  
p17039
aVbecause to get a qualified recipient is not easy 
p17040
aVit s not easy 
p17041
aVknowledge may be there 
p17042
aVwhen it comes to experiential knowing 
p17043
aVhow many people are willing to receive it 
p17044
aVeverybody says   yes 
p17045
aVi every day meet people  
p17046
aV all the way  sadhguru  i want to go all the way   
p17047
aVtomorrow morning 
p17048
aVthey are crying because somebody said something 
p17049
aVthey want to leave 
p17050
aVday after tomorrow morning 
p17051
aVtheir uncle s daughter s birthday they want to go  
p17052
aVi am not saying there s anything wrong with your uncle s daughter  
p17053
aVall i am saying is your interests are many 
p17054
aVthat means you are not going anywhere 
p17055
aVyou can dabble with many but there must be one direction to life 
p17056
aVotherwise you are not going far 
p17057
aVyou re going to wander around here 
p17058
aVif you want to go  penetrate through something and go a distance 
p17059
aVyou need some one pointedness 
p17060
aVpeople come here 
p17061
aVthey say   sadhguru  you give me any kind of sadhana 
p17062
aVi am willing to die  sadhguru   
p17063
aVi say   don t die  hold it  
p17064
aVi am willing to offer anything  but hold it 
p17065
aVwe will see  we will go step by step 
p17066
aVthree days later  they come and say
p17067
aV sadhguru  you know sadhguru  i have
p17068
aVi have found somebody sadhguru 
p17069
aVi think for lifetimes this person must have been waiting for me 
p17070
aVi saw this girl and phoo   
p17071
aVnow  now there is a spiritual angle to it 
p17072
aV it looks like for lifetimes we have known each other   
p17073
aVif you have known somebody for lifetimes
p17074
aVand you didn t make it 
p17075
aVit s best you keep away from them 
p17076
aVbecause for most people 
p17077
aVtheir direction of life keeps changing every other day 
p17078
aVit s hard to offer anything 
p17079
aVit s all bits and pieces 
p17080
aVof course  there are also people who think 
p17081
aVsee knowledge is not something that you own because
p17082
aVknowledge is not about you 
p17083
aVknowledge is about the creation 
p17084
aVabout the nature of the creation 
p17085
aVwhat is already there is what you have absorbed 
p17086
aVyou didn t invent it 
p17087
aVyou didn t come up with it 
p17088
aVyou only saw it 
p17089
aVthis is why the language in this country is very clear 
p17090
aVwhen it comes to any kind of spiritual dimension 
p17091
aVwe are only talking about realization 
p17092
aVrealizing means something that was always there 
p17093
aValways right here 
p17094
aVbut you were so stupid you didn t see it 
p17095
aVtoday you saw it 
p17096
aVi realized 
p17097
aVi did not attain 
p17098
aVi did not arise 
p17099
aVi did not climb somewhere 
p17100
aVi just realized 
p17101
aVbut the thing was always here 
p17102
aVso  what is here all the time as truth
p17103
aVcannot belong to somebody 
p17104
aVnobody can stop you from it
p17105
aVbut those who have access  
p17106
aVif they have truly accessed  
p17107
aVthey will never block you 
p17108
aVthey will never hold back 
p17109
aVonly those who have accumulated from books and stuff 
p17110
aVthey will hold back
p17111
aVbecause any accumulated stuff is limited
p17112
aVand it will get over 
p17113
aVif you give away everything  it will get over
p17114
aVtomorrow morning  you won t know what to do 
p17115
aVso  you will hold it and be miserly because you have gathered it 
p17116
aVwhat is gathered you can hold back 
p17117
aVwhat you have realized you cannot hold back because it s an endless run 
p17118
aVyou only constantly wishing
p17119
aVthere is somebody here  who can soak it up as fast as you can give it 
p17120
aVthat is the problem 
p17121
aVthe problem is of lack of receptivity  not of holding back   
p17122
aVif you really know 
p17123
aVbut if you have acquired knowledge
p17124
aVyou will be miserly
p17125
aVbecause you can only acquire that much 
p17126
aVyou don t want it  don t want it to get over 
p17127
aVknowledge is like money again  
p17128
aVit can get over  
p17129
aV our next question comes from bryn 
p17130
aVwho is a circus performer and teacher based in france 
p17131
aVi m afraid i have to read this question as well
p17132
aVwhile the technical difficulties are being sorted out 
p17133
aVbryn s question is  
p17134
aVpeople living in western societies have many distractions at every corner 
p17135
aVhow do we maintain a focus in our daily lives
p17136
aVto best receive what you have to offer 
p17137
aV oh  the distraction is not only in the west  
p17138
aVfor those who want to be distracted  there is distractions everywhere 
p17139
aVnot only in the west 
p17140
aVand not just today  even a thousand years ago
p17141
aVpeople were still distracted  believe me 
p17142
aVdon t think thousand years ago 
p17143
aVeverybody was focused and fantastic  
p17144
aVno 
p17145
aVthey were just as good as you or as bad as you  
p17146
aVthey were also hanging out in small groups  
p17147
aVnow we are hanging out globally  
p17148
aVso  what is that one thing i have to do
p17149
aVto be focused or to be able to receive what is offered 
p17150
aVvery simple  
p17151
aVjust remind yourself 
p17152
aVtomorrow morning  when you wake up in the morning 
p17153
aVjust check  
p17154
aVstill alive 
p17155
aVbecause every day over a million people die on this planet 
p17156
aVyou woke up tomorrow morning 
p17157
aVover a million people did not wake up tomorrow morning
p17158
aVwill not wake up tomorrow morning  believe me 
p17159
aVyou woke up  just check   you re still there  
p17160
aVgreat  isn t it 
p17161
aVyou re still alive 
p17162
aVcan you at least smile 
p17163
aV oh i am still alive   great 
p17164
aVjust check those three four five people who really matter in your life 
p17165
aVcheck if all of them are alive
p17166
aVbecause if one million people die 
p17167
aVat least ten million people lost somebody who is dear to them  isn't it 
p17168
aVso all those who are  who really matter for you 
p17169
aVyou are alive  they are alive   fantastic today 
p17170
aVit s a great day  isn't it  
p17171
aVdon t take this lightly  this s not a joke
p17172
aVbecause 
p17173
aVi am reminding you of this
p17174
aVbecause most of you think 
p17175
aV other people die  
p17176
aVah  not me 
p17177
aVit s only others who die 
p17178
aVno  no  you and me will die 
p17179
aV sadhguru  i am asking a spiritual question 
p17180
aVyou re reminding me of morbid things 
p17181
aV  no  nothing morbid about it 
p17182
aVdeath is the one common denominator among all of us  isn't it 
p17183
aVyes 
p17184
aVone thing common about us 
p17185
aVwhether you are black  white  blue  yellow 
p17186
aVwhatever kind you are 
p17187
aVman  woman or other six genders  
p17188
aVwhatever you may be 
p17189
aVone common denominator among all of us is 
p17190
aVwe will die one day 
p17191
aVtch  look at the universality of death  
p17192
aVonly when you remind yourself that you are mortal 
p17193
aVwanting to know something beyond the physicality of who you are
p17194
aVbecomes an active process 
p17195
aVyou will become receptive
p17196
aVonly when you know the body that you carry 
p17197
aVthe psychological drama that you are going through 
p17198
aVall this is going on 
p17199
aVbut  one day  pup  it will end 
p17200
aVvery easily  it will end  believe me 
p17201
aVyou just have to wait  
p17202
aVsee  you don t have to do anything to achieve death 
p17203
aVjust have to wait 
p17204
aVboth for yours and others 
p17205
aVpeople come and say 
p17206
aV sadhguru this guy  my enemy i can t bear it 
p17207
aVi say   just wait  
p17208
aVyou don t have to take the trouble  just wait   
p17209
aVone way or the other you will get rid of him 
p17210
aVeither he will die or you will die laughter applause 
p17211
aVso  do this every hour  tch
p17212
aV30 
p17213
aVoh  i am still alive  great   
p17214
ag17213
aVyou know how many people died on the planet 
p17215
aV but it s not me  right now 
p17216
aVnow  if you are continuously conscious of your mortal nature 
p17217
aVyou will become one hundred percent alive
p17218
aVto the spiritual dimension of who you are 
p17219
aVonly because somewhere 
p17220
aVit s not that intellectually you do not know 
p17221
aVbut experientially you are immortal  you know 
p17222
aVbecause when i look at the number of shoes you have bought  
p17223
aVit looks like you are going to live for 10 000 years  
p17224
aVnumber of clothes and shoes  when i look at them 
p17225
aVit looks like lot of people are planning for 1 000  10 000 years of life 
p17226
aVno  no  no  it s a brief life 
p17227
aVif you know it s a brief life
p17228
aVand you are definitely mortal
p17229
aVwe will try to stretch it with yoga 
p17230
aVtch  hmm 
p17231
aVwe will try to stretch it and make it little longer  but 
p17232
aVanyway  you will die 
p17233
aVif you are conscious of this every moment of your life
p17234
aVinitially  because you are in europe 
p17235
aVbecause particularly you are in europe
p17236
aVand you have always believed you are immortal  
p17237
aVit may be little struggle in  in the beginning 
p17238
aVbut still  remind yourself every minute that  i am mortal 
p17239
aVi ll die someday and maybe it s today 
p17240
aVcome to ease with death 
p17241
aVthen the longing to know what is beyond this physical nature
p17242
aVwill burst forth within you 
p17243
aVonce this longing comes 
p17244
aVyou are one hundred percent receptive to everything that i represent  
p17245
aV the next question comes from divya bharathi ramaswamy 
p17246
aVwho is doing an ma in computer science in zurich  switzerland 
p17247
aV is she talking kind or no   
p17248
aV  namaskaram sadhguru  my question is  
p17249
aVwould marriage be only a hindrance if someone  spiritually     especially women 
p17250
aVand also  for someone who has gone through    yourself 
p17251
aVwhat would you say  from your experience  
p17252
aV something about would marriage be a hindrance  something  okay
p17253
aV 
p17254
aVis marriage a hindrance for one s spiritual journey 
p17255
aVsee  marriage is not a commodity that you carry on your head 
p17256
aVbut many people carry it on their head 
p17257
aVit s just an arrangement 
p17258
aVso that socially  there is some sense to the way
p17259
aVyou fulfill the needs that you have 
p17260
aVa human being has needs  
p17261
aVphysical 
p17262
aVpsychological 
p17263
aVemotional 
p17264
aVfinancial 
p17265
aVsocial 
p17266
aVvarious kinds of needs 
p17267
aVto fulfill these things in a dignified manner 
p17268
aVwe came up with something called marriage 
p17269
aVso that it is fulfilled within a framework 
p17270
aVyour desires don t run wild
p17271
aVand disturb everything in the society 
p17272
aVsome kind of a framework
p17273
aVso that it can be conducted in a sensible manner 
p17274
aVnow you have raised this to heaven
p17275
aVbecause somebody told you 
p17276
aV marriages are made in heaven   
p17277
aVonly the unmarried ones think so  
p17278
aVso it s just two people  all right 
p17279
aVnow  spiritual process is about turning inward 
p17280
aVcan i turn inward with somebody else  
p17281
aVmarriage is an arrangement to fulfill certain aspect of your life 
p17282
aVdon t complicate life by thinking 
p17283
aV we will walk together on the spiritual path 
p17284
aVthere is no such thing
p17285
aVbecause spiritual path is not 
p17286
aVnot the path that you take into the velliangiri mountains 
p17287
aVthat you want to walk together 
p17288
aVeven if you go to velliangiri mountains 
p17289
aVplease don t walk hand in hand  
p17290
aVit s a narrow pathway
p17291
aVand it s not an appropriate way to walk in the forest  
p17292
aVyou can walk in the park hand in hand 
p17293
aVyou can go shopping hand in hand 
p17294
aVyou can sit in a cinema hand in hand 
p17295
aVyou can t turn inward hand in hand  
p17296
aVnow  does it mean to say someone who is married 
p17297
aVwhat it
p17298
aVlet s understand this 
p17299
aVsomeone who is married means
p17300
aVsomeone who s made an official arrangement for their needs in life 
p17301
aVa formal arrangement for simple needs that a human being has 
p17302
aVwhich are biological 
p17303
aVwhich are psychological 
p17304
aVwhich are social  many things 
p17305
aVso  these arrangements that you have made 
p17306
aVconduct these arrangements gracefully 
p17307
aVso there will be time and space for you to turn around 
p17308
aVif you pay excess attention to these arrangements 
p17309
aVthen turning around will not be possible 
p17310
aVthis does not mean if you are alone  you will do it 
p17311
aVif you are alone  you may be always looking out  
p17312
aVyou will spend your entire time and life looking out for somebody 
p17313
aVthat will also not help 
p17314
aVif you think your desires 
p17315
aVyour longings
p17316
aVand your needs
p17317
aVcan be well handled by an arrangement of marriage  
p17318
aVall right 
p17319
aVdon t try to raise it to heaven 
p17320
aVit doesn t happen in heaven  believe me 
p17321
aVand if heaven is making so many mistakes  
p17322
aVthen we will have to seriously reconsider many things  
p17323
aVso  of course in india 
p17324
aVwe don t blame it on the heaven 
p17325
aVwe do our own calculations 
p17326
aVof all the arrangements of stars and planets and everything 
p17327
aVwe match all the planets and stars very well 
p17328
aVit s very easy to match stars because
p17329
aVthey never fought ever  
p17330
aVbut to match these two people  
p17331
aVthat nobody has managed 
p17332
aVexcept those two people if they are sensible  
p17333
aVif they are sensible  they can manage it 
p17334
aVnobody else can match these two people  
p17335
aVpriests have tried 
p17336
aVgods have tried 
p17337
aVghosts and goblins have tried 
p17338
aVit s not worked and not worked and not worked 
p17339
aVtwo sensible people  they can manage 
p17340
aVif both of them understand the limitations of the arrangement
p17341
aVand the possibilities of the arrangement 
p17342
aVthey can conduct it sensibly 
p17343
aVif you try to raise it to heaven 
p17344
aVyou will see it will for sure crash 
p17345
aVso  your marriage has nothing to do with your spiritual process
p17346
aVbecause your spiritual process is an inward journey 
p17347
aVbut one dimension of this is  
p17348
aVto walk alone  people falter 
p17349
aVactually  this question was asked to gautama the buddha 
p17350
aV is it better to walk alone or in company 
p17351
aVgautama looked and said 
p17352
aV it s better to walk alone than to walk with a fool   
p17353
aVbecause gautama   not me  okay   
p17354
aVgautama believes only a fool will marry you  
p17355
aVit s him 
p17356
aVnot me  okay  
p17357
ag16985
aV this is a question that comes from stephanie in malaysia 
p17358
aV namaskaram sadhguru 
p17359
aV namaskaram  the first one who is speaking clearly  
p17360
aV having been to various international forums and met many great leaders 
p17361
aVwhere do you see the world heading 
p17362
aVfor the better or worse 
p17363
aV oh   let me correct that question a bit 
p17364
aVyes  i ve been in international forums  met many leaders 
p17365
aVyou added  great  leaders  
p17366
aVso  many leaders   not always so great 
p17367
aVyes  there are a few great leaders  no question about that 
p17368
aVwhere is the world heading  
p17369
aVthere are many possibilities
p17370
aVbecause we have capabilities and technologies 
p17371
aVwhich no other generation could ever dream of 
p17372
aVwill our capabilities turn against us
p17373
aVor will they work for us is the big question 
p17374
aVif all the human capabilities 
p17375
aVwhich are so hugely enhanced
p17376
aVbecause of technology
p17377
aVeverything that an individual human being could do
p17378
aVhas expanded manifold 
p17379
aVin this enhanced state
p17380
aVand our numbers have increased tremendously 
p17381
aVin the beginning of twentieth century 
p17382
aVwe were just about 1 5 billion people 
p17383
aVtoday we are 7 3 billion people 
p17384
aVthe united nations making predictions that by 2050 
p17385
aVwe will be 9 7 billion people 
p17386
aVif all these people get educated  get technologically empowered 
p17387
aV9 7 billion people or nearly 10 billion people on this planet
p17388
aVis for sure going to be a disaster 
p17389
ag17184
aVwe can make arrangements and arrangements 
p17390
aVwe can improve the arrangements 
p17391
aVwe can make more energy saving machines 
p17392
aVwe can recycle the shit  
p17393
aVyes  
p17394
aVwe can do all this
p17395
aVbut if we don t come to our senses with human populations 
p17396
aVthere s going to be
p17397
aVi want you to just imagine 
p17398
aVhow the world will be
p17399
aVif the population almost goes up by fifty percent tomorrow 
p17400
aVjust imagine your town  how it will be
p17401
aVif fifty percent population increases tomorrow morning 
p17402
aVor in other words 
p17403
aVno matter what we create 
p17404
aVno matter how much we strive 
p17405
aVwhether
p17406
aVwhatever we build 
p17407
aVeverything is going to be insufficient
p17408
aVbecause the planet is going to be insufficient 
p17409
aVof course  we are looking at planets
p17410
aVwhich could sustain life outside of this solar system 
p17411
aVwe ve found two three very promising planets 
p17412
aVit s just a little  you know  not in the walking distance   
p17413
aVa few 
p17414
aVfew thousand or a million light years away 
p17415
aVgreat planets  i believe 
p17416
aVbut this is the thing 
p17417
aVbut nobody wants to address this issue 
p17418
aVeverybody wants to talk about cosmetic solutions 
p17419
aVnot address the basic problem of expanding human population 
p17420
aVi was in a conference and i said 
p17421
aV see  unless you 
p17422
aVunless you reduce the human footprint on the planet 
p17423
aVthere is no solution for anything 
p17424
aVthen they asked me a brilliant question 
p17425
aV how do you reduce the human footprint 
p17426
aVi said   you have to reduce the number of feet  
p17427
aVthat s the only way   
p17428
aVso  right now 
p17429
aVit doesn t matter what others think 
p17430
aVall of you who are here
p17431
aVand those of you who re hanging out with me 
p17432
aVwe can take it upon ourselves
p17433
aVthat we will not push the human population 
p17434
aVyou can have a dog  
p17435
aVshe is there   
p17436
aVa husband and wife were having a debate  
p17437
aVwhether to have a child or not 
p17438
aVthe husband wanted a child 
p17439
aVthe wife hesitating because
p17440
aVshe will lose the shape of her body and you know 
p17441
aVfor a husband 
p17442
aVhaving a baby is simple  
p17443
aVbut for the woman 
p17444
aVit s too many things involved 
p17445
aVso  debate was going on
p17446
aVand then they came and the debate moved into an area where 
p17447
aV should we have a baby or should we get a dog   
p17448
aVthen they could not decide 
p17449
aVthey went to a counselor 
p17450
aVthey put their problem in front of him 
p17451
aVso  he said 
p17452
aV you got to just make up your mind 
p17453
aVwhether you want to ruin the carpets or your life   
p17454
aVi am not saying children are bad  they are wonderful 
p17455
aVbut it s just too many 
p17456
aVwe as human beings 
p17457
aVwe are wonderful but we are too many 
p17458
aVwe re so many that the insect population is going down  
p17459
aVno  no  it s not a joke  it s very  it s very threatening 
p17460
aVif the insect population disappears  the planet will be destroyed 
p17461
ag17184
aVthe worms disappear 
p17462
aVthe planet will be destroyed 
p17463
aVif you and me disappear  planet will flourish  
p17464
aVso  leave the leaders alone
p17465
aVbecause in every conference that you meet 
p17466
aVvery cosmetic solutions are being talked about  
p17467
aVhow to adjust the market place  okay  
p17468
aVhow to do this  how to do that 
p17469
aVi  on immediate scale  yes 
p17470
aVthose things are necessary 
p17471
aVbut you are talking about what is the future of this world 
p17472
aVif that is so 
p17473
aVif we want a future for this world 
p17474
aVif we want our children and their children to live well on this planet 
p17475
aVthe only way is to bring down human population  
p17476
aVnot by doing some horrible acts 
p17477
aVbut if we have
p17478
aVsee  our life expectancy has improved 
p17479
aVthis means we have taken death into our hands 
p17480
aVwhen we take death into our hands 
p17481
aVit is our business to take birth also into our hands  isn't it  
p17482
aVif we convince the population of this one thing 
p17483
aVfuture is very bright 
p17484
aVbecause tomorrow morning the sun will come up 
p17485
aVwhat s the problem  
p17486
ag16913
aV the next question comes from sahil gurung from the united kingdom 
p17487
aV namaskaram sadhguruji 
p17488
ag16785
aV sadhguruji  my question is  
p17489
aVis enlightenment a gradual process
p17490
aVor it happens when our body  mind and energies comes to a point
p17491
aVwhere it is perfectly satisfied 
p17492
aVlike making a quantum leap 
p17493
aVthank you 
p17494
aV are you asking how it happens in uk or in india  
p17495
aV  on planet earth 
p17496
aV  so the question is  
p17497
ag17490
aVor when your body  mind  energies align 
p17498
aVis it like a quantum leap 
p17499
aVis it something that bursts out 
p17500
aV yes  
p17501
aV see  the mango season is just getting over 
p17502
aVyou don t know what it is 
p17503
aVsahil  you are in uk 
p17504
aVmango season is getting over 
p17505
aVin india  it s a big thing 
p17506
aVif you looked at the mango tree in the month of october  november  december 
p17507
aVyou didn t see any sweetness dripping out of it 
p17508
aVsuddenly in january  february  flowers came 
p17509
aVthey were not as attractive as jasmine or rose flowers or something 
p17510
aVsome tiny little flowers came 
p17511
aVsuppose you do not know this is a mango tree
p17512
aVand you tested it 
p17513
aVyou take a leaf and bite it  it was quite bitter 
p17514
aVbut suddenly in the month of april  may 
p17515
aVhuge drops of sweetness 
p17516
aVhanging there in the tree  tch
p17517
aVsahil  you have not eaten the mango this season  
p17518
aV i got it from the supermarket  that s all  
p17519
aV eh  you are  you are eating mangoes from nigeria  
p17520
aVso  if you did not have prior
p17521
aVprior knowledge that this is a mango tree 
p17522
aVdid you think
p17523
aVthis tree is actually manufacturing this sweetness 
p17524
aVbut you think suddenly in april  sweetness came 
p17525
aVit has been slowly manufacturing this sweetness
p17526
aVand it put it out at a certain season 
p17527
aVbut it s been on  right through the year  isn't it 
p17528
aVmangoes happen only in one season 
p17529
aVyou notice the sweetness only at a certain time 
p17530
aVthis does not mean
p17531
aVthe mango tree was not striving and working to produce that sweetness 
p17532
aVyou cut any part of the mango tree and taste it  
p17533
aVtch  you will not find  a slightest tinge of sweetness 
p17534
ag16883
aVbut when the mango comes 
p17535
aVhow much sweetness 
p17536
aVwhere is it coming from 
p17537
aVit s been working on it 
p17538
aVyou couldn t see it 
p17539
aVsimilarly  is it a process 
p17540
aVfor sure  it is a process 
p17541
aVbut can everybody see the process 
p17542
aVidentify the process 
p17543
ag17145
aVwhen somebody is evolving on the spiritual path 
p17544
aVothers thought he is a nutcase 
p17545
aVsomebody thought he s vagrant 
p17546
aVsomebody thought he is a vagabond 
p17547
aVsomebody thought he is something else 
p17548
aVbut when the sweetness came 
p17549
aVeverybody who tasted realized that
p17550
aVthis is a fantastic thing  
p17551
aVso  nothing in the universe happens bang  bang  bang 
p17552
aVeverything is a process 
p17553
aVcan you identify the process 
p17554
aVcan you recognize the process is the question 
p17555
aVgenerally  anybody who carries
p17556
aVgenerally among human beings 
p17557
aVwhen they are children 
p17558
aVany child which carries a certain level of genius within him 
p17559
aVwhich is irrepressible
p17560
aVeverybody has genius within them but they are repressible 
p17561
aVsystems in the society 
p17562
aVtheir own fears 
p17563
aVtheir own anxieties 
p17564
aVtheir own need for security represses their genius 
p17565
aVevery human being has some kind of genius
p17566
aVbut over ninety percent of the human beings
p17567
aVnever find expression to it because
p17568
aVthey give in to other things 
p17569
aVthings become  other things become more important 
p17570
aVwhen you were twelve  fifteen you thought 
p17571
aV i ll do this 
p17572
aVi ll do that 
p17573
aVi ll go to the moon 
p17574
aVbut you saw the neighborhood girl 
p17575
aVand started calling her the moon  
p17576
aVmoon disappeared  
p17577
aVhey  
p17578
aVso  like this 
p17579
aVin everybody the possibility is wide open 
p17580
aVthe thing is
p17581
aVcan you sustain the process
p17582
aVand allow it to become that possibility 
p17583
aVbetween possibility and reality  there is a distance 
p17584
aVmost people neither have the courage nor the conviction
p17585
aVto walk that distance 
p17586
aVlargely  spiritual process is a kind of an entertainment 
p17587
aVgo to discourse after discourse  discourse after discourse 
p17588
aVread more and more books
p17589
aVand debate how your atman  paramatman  your soul is floating here  there
p17590
aVand about heaven and hell and everything
p17591
aVbut do nothing about this   
p17592
aVso  it's largely 
p17593
aVit s largely like entertainment 
p17594
aVso  there is a process for sure 
p17595
aVthe process can be approached consciously
p17596
aVor it may be an unconscious process
p17597
aVbut you re doing the right things 
p17598
aVthis is the beauty of this universe  
p17599
aVwhether you know or you do not know 
p17600
aVknowingly or unknowingly 
p17601
aVwith discipline or with indiscipline 
p17602
aVwith love or with hate 
p17603
aVif you do the right things 
p17604
aVright things will happen to you 
p17605
aVthat is the beauty of this universe  
p17606
aVso shankara  adi shankara said 
p17607
aV yogarathova bhogarathova 
p17608
aVsomehow  either through yoga or bhoga 
p17609
aVsomehow do it 
p17610
aVsomehow find the truth of your inner nature
p17611
aVbecause what we are considering as truth is simply this  
p17612
aVwhatever works on all levels of life must be the truth  isn't it 
p17613
aVhmm 
p17614
aVwhatever really works on all levels of life must be the truth 
p17615
aVwhatever you know in your life  test it right now  because
p17616
aVyou have a mind which can project 
p17617
aVright now  you are striving for a certain level of income
p17618
aVor a certain kind of house
p17619
aVor a car
p17620
aVor something else or something else 
p17621
aVput yourself in different stages of life and see
p17622
aVif it still means a lot to you 
p17623
aVsee  suppose
p17624
aVnot tomorrow 
p17625
aVlet s say hundred years later 
p17626
aVyou are on your deathbed 
p17627
aVjust see if your jewelry  your make up  your car will mean something to you on that day 
p17628
aVthis does not mean you must give it up today 
p17629
aVit is just that you must keep it in its place 
p17630
aVyou must not carry it in your heart   
p17631
aVthere is a difference
p17632
aVbetween using something and being used by something 
p17633
aVmost people
p17634
aVmost people do not know how to use the things that they buy 
p17635
aVthe things that they buy are using them up 
p17636
aVthey are enslaving the human being 
p17637
aVwhatever things you want to use  you can use  that s not an issue 
p17638
aVbut the problem is
p17639
aVyou let those things use you 
p17640
aVthis is not okay 
p17641
aVso if you just take care that
p17642
aVyou are not used by anything 
p17643
aVyou understand the limited role that everything has in your life  
p17644
aVthe limited role of your education 
p17645
aVthe limited role of your career 
p17646
aVthe limited role of your marriage 
p17647
aVthe limited role of your relationships 
p17648
aVthe limited role of your wealth 
p17649
aVthe limited role of everything that you are doing  
p17650
aVif you understand
p17651
aVwhere one thing begins and where it ends 
p17652
aVthen you don t have to do anything 
p17653
aVspiritual process is on  
p17654
aVwhen the season is right 
p17655
aVthe flowers will bloom and mangoes will come   
p17656
aV the next question  comes from a prominent figure in indian public life 
p17657
aVthis is the honorable minister of state for culture 
p17658
aVtourism and civil aviation  dr  mahesh sharma 
p17659
aV thank you sadhguruji 
p17660
aVyou gave me opportunity to mark this celebration of guru poornima utsav
p17661
aVwith this much big presence over here 
p17662
aVbut a big question comes to my mind that we keep 
p17663
aVand especially the indians keep after the god and parents 
p17664
aVguru at the highest esteem 
p17665
aVbut we have not been able to make guru poornima celebration utsav in the same spirit of high spirit
p17666
aVas we respect the gurus 
p17667
aV i kind of addressed this already in the beginning but anyway 
p17668
aVthe reason why
p17669
aVguru poornima and so many other things 
p17670
aVwhich were of great spiritual importance in this country 
p17671
aVhave slid back into the background of our lives is  
p17672
aVbecause we have been an occupied nation for a period of time
p17673
aVand whatever the framework that the occupying forces set for us 
p17674
aVwhen we got our independence 
p17675
aVwe should have looked at
p17676
aVwhat kind of framework we want for our nation 
p17677
aVwe did not do that 
p17678
aVwe just allowed the same framework to continue 
p17679
aVfor example 
p17680
aVin this country 
p17681
aVright from ancient times 
p17682
aVeven for a farmer who ploughs the land 
p17683
aVeven today many farmers
p17684
aVdon t set their plough on their land on monday mornings 
p17685
ag17184
aVin tamil nadu  it s still true 
p17686
aVin the north  it s been given up
p17687
aVbecause no
p17688
aVno animals being used  all tractors 
p17689
aVyou have to
p17690
aVyou have taken a bank loan 
p17691
aVthe interest is ticking 
p17692
aVso you want it to run all the seven days  
p17693
aVall these things 
p17694
aVwhen the british came 
p17695
aVthey changed these things
p17696
aVbecause they  they knew the strength of this nation was essentially in the culture 
p17697
aVso they wanted to break the culture 
p17698
aVvery systematically  they engineered
p17699
aVhow to break the culture 
p17700
aVthey made you sunday holiday 
p17701
aVwhat are you going to do on sunday 
p17702
aVwatch television and eat potato chips  
p17703
ag17702
aVthey had an intention for a sunday morning 
p17704
aVwhat is the intention for the majority of the population in this country on sunday morning 
p17705
aVthere is nothing for us to do on sunday morning 
p17706
aVmonday morning  there re lots of things happening 
p17707
aVbut you have to go to office 
p17708
aVfor a long time in this country 
p17709
aVthe monthly holidays were like this  
p17710
aVpournami means
p17711
aVevery pournami means three days holiday  
p17712
aVone day before  the day and the next day 
p17713
aVamavasya means two days holiday  
p17714
aVthese
p17715
aVthese two days of full moon day and new moon day
p17716
aVhave something to do with our system  
p17717
aVsomething to do with the planet 
p17718
aVsomething to do with the very way we re born 
p17719
aVwe are physically here today
p17720
aVonly because our mothers  bodies were in sync with the cycles of the moon 
p17721
aVotherwise we won t be here 
p17722
aVso  there are things which are happening in your system 
p17723
aVas you know  the very oceans are rising on these days 
p17724
aVwhen such a massive body of water is rising up 
p17725
aVthis body 
p17726
aVwhich is over seventy percent water 
p17727
aVyou think nothing is rising in this  
p17728
aVthat  the  those days were kept as spiritually significant days 
p17729
aVthose are not the days to go to work 
p17730
aVthose are the days to focus upon yourself 
p17731
aVso  similarly the guru poornima used to be a huge festival across the
p17732
aVthis whole region 
p17733
aVbut it s gone because people have to go to work 
p17734
aVso  i request you 
p17735
aVbeing
p17736
aVyou being a minister in the union cabinet 
p17737
aVthis is something that you must do  
p17738
aVthat
p17739
aVi know for you to pitch for every pournima
p17740
aVpournami being a holiday is not going to be practical 
p17741
aVbut at least guru poornima  
p17742
aVif you
p17743
aVfrom the federal government 
p17744
aVfrom the central government 
p17745
aVif you declare guru poornima as a holiday 
p17746
aVi will make sure guru poornima is celebrated across this country 
p17747
aVwith great fervor 
p17748
aVbecause
p17749
aVbecause the spirit is still alive 
p17750
aVthere is no space for expression 
p17751
aVthere is no space or time for expression 
p17752
aVplease  if you can do this one thing 
p17753
aVand we can make guru poornima a big tourism attraction for this country 
p17754
aVas
p17755
aVas i have already spoken to you
p17756
aVabout making
p17757
aVindia the spiritual gateway 
p17758
aVguru poornima can be the day
p17759
aVwhich really draws spiritual tourists from across the world to this country 
p17760
aVso  even as a part of your job  
p17761
aVit s a good thing to do   
p17762
aV sadhguru  the next question comes from heena parekh 
p17763
aVa twenty year old student from northampton in the united kingdom 
p17764
aV sadhguru  what is the significance of initiation 
p17765
aV okay 
p17766
aVwhat is the significance of initiation 
p17767
aVinitiation is not about a bundle of instructions 
p17768
aVin fact  in any initiation process 
p17769
aVinstructions are a kind of disturbance 
p17770
aVit s a nuisance 
p17771
aVi am saying it s a nuisance because
p17772
aVwe are still giving instructions
p17773
aVbecause most people
p17774
aVbecause today they have all become educated 
p17775
aVeverything has to be told  you know 
p17776
aVor it must be printed  these days 
p17777
aVif you tell them also it s not enough 
p17778
aVthey wanted a printed sheet 
p17779
aVthe instructions of the initiation
p17780
aVbecause they are all educated 
p17781
aVtheir brains are full of words 
p17782
aVnot of life 
p17783
aVtoo many words 
p17784
aVso everything has to be verbal 
p17785
aVeven saying it is not good enough 
p17786
aVyou have to print it
p17787
aVor you have to record it and give it to them
p17788
aVso that they can put headphones
p17789
aVand listen to the instructions every time 
p17790
aVinitiation is not a bundle of words 
p17791
aVif we have to use an analogy 
p17792
aVif you know something about electricity  
p17793
aVin electrical imple  you know  motors and stuff 
p17794
aVthere is something called as induction 
p17795
aVthe power is there 
p17796
aVthe motor is there 
p17797
aVeverything is there 
p17798
aVbut without an induction switch it will not go 
p17799
aVall the ingredients are there
p17800
aVbut still it will not happen
p17801
aVbecause there s no induction of energy 
p17802
aVso initiation is like an induction 
p17803
aVyou have all the ingredients to be meditative
p17804
aVbut it doesn t happen  
p17805
aVwhy does it not happen 
p17806
aVbecause this is the way the creation itself happened 
p17807
aVif you go by the traditional explanation  
p17808
aVone way 
p17809
aVif you go by the modern scientific way  
p17810
aVit s the same thing said in a different language 
p17811
aVmodern science is talking about
p17812
aVhow everything was empty space 
p17813
aVnow they are removing the word empty and saying it was space 
p17814
aVthere is no physicality there
p17815
aVbut there seems to be something else there 
p17816
aVwhat that something else  we don t know 
p17817
aVas per the science 
p17818
aVand today they ve made experiments
p17819
aVwhere in vacuum state 
p17820
aVif you apply a certain energy around it  
p17821
aVnot into it 
p17822
aVaround it  
p17823
aVsuddenly virtual protons and virtual neutrons will spill out 
p17824
aVthat means creation begins
p17825
aVjust because there s energy playing around 
p17826
aVthere is a beautiful story in the yogic tradition 
p17827
aVshiva
p17828
aVyou must understand the word shiva 
p17829
aVshiva means  shi va means that which is not 
p17830
aVappropriate description for space 
p17831
aVthat which is  is physical creation 
p17832
aVthat which is not 
p17833
aVis non physical dimension of the existence 
p17834
aVso shiva means that which is not 
p17835
aVshiva was lying 
p17836
aVhis body spread across the cosmos 
p17837
aVbut he is not 
p17838
aVhe doesn t exist 
p17839
aVhe doesn t have a physical manifestation 
p17840
aVthen shakti  a certain dimension of energy 
p17841
aVcame and danced around him
p17842
aVand then he came alive 
p17843
aVthen he started spitting galaxies out of his mouth 
p17844
aVthis is the most  appropriate description
p17845
aVof how creation happened 
p17846
aVstill spitting galaxies 
p17847
aVnew galaxies 
p17848
aVit s continuously happening 
p17849
aVsimply because a certain energy touched it 
p17850
aVeverything that was needed for creation was already there in him
p17851
aVbut he needed induction 
p17852
aVso  initiation is a kind of an induction process 
p17853
aVbut unfortunately today 
p17854
aVif i just ask people to just sit here 
p17855
aVwe ll do things for you 
p17856
aVthey ll     
p17857
aV nothing happening 
p17858
aVwhy is he not doing anything   
p17859
aVyou are supposed to say something 
p17860
aVso what to do 
p17861
aVfor modern times  we say a lot of things 
p17862
aVwe hang out with you  
p17863
aVtoday if you go and sit in the dhyanalinga temple 
p17864
aVwithout instruction you can become meditative 
p17865
aVi can do that to you here now 
p17866
aVwhat's her name 
p17867
aVheena 
p17868
aVheena  you are in uk 
p17869
aVif you re willing to just sit there 
p17870
aVi can do it to you now  wherever you are 
p17871
aVbut right now  you got too
p17872
aVyou are a student  still educating  
p17873
aVmaybe you are a possibility  not fully educated  
p17874
aVtoo many words in your head 
p17875
aVthe only thing you understand is words 
p17876
aVbecause of that  instructions have come 
p17877
aVotherwise  initiation is not about instruction 
p17878
aVthere really no instruction in it 
p17879
aVinitiation is just an induction process 
p17880
aVit s an energy process 
p17881
aVbut we have to talk about energy  tch  you know 
p17882
aVwe have to talk a lot about energy
p17883
aVbefore they open their mouth and 
p17884
aV ohh  appadiya   
p17885
aVtough times for gurus  
p17886
aVtoo much talking  
p17887
aVif you don t talk  nobody will be here 
p17888
aVvery few can really understand  
p17889
aVif we simply sit here and reverberate 
p17890
aVthey will also sit here and reverberate 
p17891
aVthose numbers are small 
p17892
aVwell  in isha  those numbers are increasing 
p17893
aVi don t have to say much  
p17894
aVbut in the larger world  you have to  tch 
p17895
aVyou have to talk  talk  talk and talk 
p17896
aVhang out with people   
p17897
aVglobal gossip 
p17898
aV our next online participant is manj musik 
p17899
aVa well known punjabi hip hop singer 
p17900
aV ohh 
p17901
aV and he prefers to call his input an offering  rather than a question 
p17902
aV hope the audio works  
p17903
aV the next question comes from sameer oberoi 
p17904
aVan advertising professional in gurgaon 
p17905
aVand his question  sadhguru  is  
p17906
aVi hope to visit the ashram for mahashivarathri next year
p17907
aVbecause i have been inspired by your description of shiva
p17908
aVas the ultimate outlaw 
p17909
aVcan you tell us something more about this fascinating figure 
p17910
aV  shiva being the ultimate outlaw  
p17911
aVyou must understand what is outlaw 
p17912
aVmany of you have suffered the in laws  
p17913
aVi hope you won t meet too many outlaws 
p17914
aVbut when we say the ultimate outlaw 
p17915
aVyou must understand all laws  
p17916
aVall laws  
p17917
aVare of some meaning only in the physical sphere of life 
p17918
aVsee suppose you did not have a body  
p17919
aVi want you to just imagine yourself 
p17920
aVyou don t have a body  
p17921
aVwhat law do you have to follow  
p17922
aVyou can go wherever you want 
p17923
aVyou can do whatever you want 
p17924
ag17184
aVonly because you have a body  
p17925
aVwhere to go 
p17926
aVwhere not to go 
p17927
aVwhat to do  what not to do 
p17928
aVonly in the physical realm  the laws have a meaning 
p17929
aVone who has transcended the physical 
p17930
aVhe has no laws 
p17931
aVso he is a outlaw 
p17932
aVhe is out of all laws 
p17933
aVthis is what spiritual process means  
p17934
aVwithin yourself  you are out of all laws
p17935
aVbecause once you transcend your physical nature 
p17936
aVnone of the laws bind you 
p17937
aVin the society   yes 
p17938
aVbut within yourself  
p17939
ag17145
aVbecause you are an outlaw because
p17940
aVyou are out of the physical nature 
p17941
aVso in that context 
p17942
aVhe is the ultimate outlaw
p17943
aVand mahashivarathri is his day 
p17944
aVthe significance of the day is that on that day 
p17945
aVthere is a phenomenal upsurge of energy within the human system 
p17946
aVthis is why on that night 
p17947
aVyou are not supposed to sleep 
p17948
aVyou must keep your spine vertical
p17949
aVso that you make use of this natural upsurge within you 
p17950
aVso on that night  there is a huge festival here 
p17951
aVthis year  this is going to be a mega festival because
p17952
aVwe have crossed the twenty one year cycle 
p17953
aVthis is a new cycle 
p17954
aVand it is going to be a phenomenal event 
p17955
aVyou must  you are in gurgaon  not too far away 
p17956
aVyou must be here on that day  it s an incredible night
p17957
aVand we will have many things happening on that night

aVwe are  already our teams are working to make this into a major possibility for every human being
p17959
aVand we will also make it happen across the country
p17960
aVand in many parts of the world in various cities 
p17961
aVhaving video feeds and stuff 
p17962
aVthough there is a time difference in the other countries 
p17963
aVand as a precursor to this in a way
p17964
aVnot really a precursor but this is a special event which happens only once  
p17965
aVonly once 
p17966
aVthat is we don t repeat this 
p17967
aVthis will happen in december 
p17968
aVtill now  we have done three special events like this 
p17969
aVwhere they are production quality 
p17970
aVentire ashram is done up for this purpose 
p17971
aVnot like other programs  which are repeated 
p17972
aVthis is only onetime programs 
p17973
aVwe did vaibhav shiva 
p17974
aVwhich was about how shiva taught yoga 
p17975
aVthen we did three years later 
p17976
aVleela  
p17977
aVthis is about how krishna taught yoga 
p17978
aVthen about three years ago 
p17979
aVwe did mahabharat 
p17980
aVwhich is the grandest story that you can imagine 
p17981
aVit s a story inside a story inside a story 
p17982
aVit s the most phenomenal story 
p17983
aVit s the longest story on the planet 
p17984
aVso  an eight day event happened like this 
p17985
aVhundreds of hours of videos 
p17986
aVthey are still editing 
p17987
aVnot released after three years  
p17988
aVso this year

p17990
aVwe will have an event 
p17991
aVwhich is about the devotees of shiva

p18097
aVbecause i am telling you 
p18098
aVbecause many questions were asked in this direction 
p18099
aVthe greatest thing or the most important thing that needs to happen on this planet is
p18100
aVan inward movement within human beings 
p18101
aVthis hugely empowered humanity 
p18102
aVwithout the necessary inner balance  is a potential danger to everybody 
p18103
aVto everything 
p18104
aVto every other life 
p18105
aVto every other creature  we are a danger 
p18106
aVso  more and more people should commit themselves
p18107
aVto turn the world inward 
p18108
aVif you are already deeply entangled in life 
p18109
aVat least send your children in that direction 
p18110

p18112
aVif you want to give 
p18113
aVsend your children in that direction 
p18114
aVthat they will strive to turn the world inward
p18115
aVbecause this is the most important thing that needs to happen
p18116
aVif human beings and every other creature on this planet
p18117
aVhas to live reasonably well on this planet 
p18118
aVotherwise there is no other way 
p18119
aVso  if you want to give something nasty 
p18120
aVplease give it away  i am welcome
p18121
aVyou are most welcome 
p18122
aVif you want to give something beautiful 
p18123
aVyou must give yourself  your time  your life 
p18124
aVif that s not possible 
p18125
aVanyway the future generation 
p18126
aVat least turn them in that direction 
p18127
aVit s very important 
p18128
aVthis is for the well being of their future 
p18129
aVit s very  very important
p18130
aVthat big number of people turn inward
p18131
aVand they have a sense of balance 
p18132
aVif this doesn t happen 
p18133
aVyou will see a very bad human society 
p18134
aVwhich will rub and clash 
p18135
aVthe friction that happens is too much 
p18136
aVso  on this day 
p18137

aVgood afternoon everybody the excellencies and ladies and gentlemen thank you for being good
p19483
aVafternoon sorrow and good afternoon to your excellencies and distinguished guests and
p19484
aVto all the meditators who are watching on the internet right now 
p19485
aVi'm so grateful to be here and and it's such a privilege really to be here  my name is maxwell kennedy and
p19486
aVi've been i learned how to meditate from sadhguru a few years ago  so we're here at the united nations and
p19487
aVtheir forts maybe 40 or 60 ambassadors here in 70 different countries and
p19488
aV7 000 people and we're here to talk about sustainable development
p19489
aVso why did you start with a chant 
p19490
aVthe chant is an invocation an invocation means
p19491
aVto perform different types of activities
p19492
aVwe need to have our energies in different ways
p19493
aVotherwise
p19494
aVmost people have become competent in one way or the other but if you ask them to do something totally different
p19495
aVthey will find themselves totally at loss
p19496
aVthis is simply because their energies get
p19497
aVdirected in one way only an invocation means
p19498
aVyou kind of make yourself malleable in such a way that for every different type of action you need your energies in different
p19499
aVparts of your system  and you are able to graduate that
p19500
aVcalibrate that in such a way to perform that specific activity
p19501
aVso when i sit here what we need to do is different from what i was doing when i was walking down here
p19502
aVso this is just calibration using sounds if we have to know the meaning it's
p19503
aVtalking about how birth is sweetness  but death is compassion so relief
p19504
aVwe may think that is a terrible thing but
p19505
aVaren't we glad that some day  we will die suppose  we could not die that would be terrible isn't it 
p19506
aVsuppose we can't die at all and
p19507
aVabove all it is talking about yoga in the sense
p19508
aVthe chant is describing yoga as a way of transcending time when we said transcending time
p19509
aVright now we have a sense of time only because we are so identified with our physical nature
p19510
aVsuppose we did not have a body we would would not have any sense of time our bodies keeping time
p19511
aVeverything that is time is cyclical
p19512
aVbut yoga is a dimension which wants to transcend which helps you to transcend these cycles and make a journey beyond
p19513
aVcyclically nature of life  which is the nature of physical existence 
p19514
aVthank you um i
p19515
aVhad a teacher at harvard who was a medical doctor
p19516
aVand he told me a story that when he was a young doctor he went down to mississippi
p19517
aVand he saw children there in the united states as in the
p19518
aVmid 1960s who were starving and
p19519
aVafter that trip he went to washington dc and
p19520
aVhe had he tried to meet a group of senators
p19521
aVand he went to one after the other and none of them would talk to him and
p19522
aVon sunday afternoon  he got my father's phone number at home
p19523
aVmy father is senator robert f kennedy and my sister carrie who runs the robert f kennedy memorial he's here right now in my wife
p19524
aVvicki so but he got my dad's number and he called and
p19525
aVand it was sunday my dad's with the children and and and he said to him are well alright
p19526
aVwhy don't you come over and we'll talk and
p19527
aVafter they spoke my dad went to mississippi
p19528
aVto where this doctor had gone  and when he came back
p19529
aVhe wrote this  he said these words and there are others on
p19530
aVthe backroads of mississippi where thousands of children slowly starved their lives away
p19531
aVtheir minds damaged beyond repair by the age of four or five in the camps of the migrant workers a
p19532
aVhalf million nomads virtually unprotected by collective bargaining or social security minimum wage or workman's compensation
p19533
aVexposed to the capra's of fate and the crew of their fellow  man alike and
p19534
aVon indian reservations where the unemployment rate is 80  and where suicide is not a philosopher's question
p19535
aVbut the leading cause of death among young people
p19536
aVso after that trip my father went back to the senate
p19537
aVand he worked with a group of others and they created the first food stamps program in the united states
p19538
aVand that is kind of the development model that i'm used to so when i look at the
p19539
aVsustainable development goals of the united nations my immediate reaction is to think are the addis ababa
p19540
aVaccords going to fund this or not
p19541
aVbut you have a different approach  can you talk about yoga in that context 
p19542
aVso when we say sustainable
p19543
aVdevelopment goals  we are talking about 
p19544
aVhuman wellbeing
p19545
aVaddressing human wellbeing as
p19546
aV17 different issues which concerns poverty
p19547
aVnourishment health women's issues environment this kind of things
p19548
aVessentially  we're talking about him and well being
p19549
aVhow can you transform the world without transforming individual human beings 
p19550
aVthis is the effort that's going on in the world for a long time  we want to transform the world
p19551
aVbut we are not aiming at individual human beings
p19552
aVthe world is just a word
p19553
aVit is just you and me if there is no transformation in you and me if there is no change in the way we perceive
p19554
aVexperience  and we think feel and act in this world  how can you change the world 
p19555
aVso we can pump in money  we can have projects
p19556
aVthey will all go up and go down
p19557
aVbut only if we transform individual human beings on a large scale only then there will be true transformation
p19558
aVthis is why yoga becomes a significant thing today 
p19559
aVthe united nations taking this taking up this international yoga day is a very important step
p19560
aVi would say it's a revolutionary approach
p19561
aVbecause without
p19562
aVtransforming individual human beings you cannot really transform the world because there is no such thing as
p19563
aVin reality in reality
p19564
aVthere's just you me and someone else if all of us change the world has changed if we refuse to change
p19565
aVwe will be only talking about it
p19566
aVi've been to any number of international peace conferences and everybody is talking about world peace in one of these
p19567
aVconferences where there were 17
p19568
aVnobel laureates  i asked him a simple question
p19569
aVis it is it true that all of you are 
p19570
aVtruly peaceful human beings can you put your hand on your heart and say i am peaceful 
p19571
aVthey admitted no sadhguru  we don't know how to be peaceful  but we want the world peaceful  how is it possible 
p19572
aVwhat what you see is the world is just a larger manifestation of who we are 
p19573
aVsadhguru you can see all around the world in brazil in the united states in la where i live people are doing yoga and
p19574
aVwhen we're doing it  we're i'm stretching out my body and
p19575
aVtrying to control my breathing
p19576
aVcan can you explain what yoga really is and how that can help 
p19577
aVattain the sdgs
p19578
aVso this fundamental human longing
p19579
aVfor health for
p19580
aVwellbeing for
p19581
aVfulfillment of life
p19582
aVwhen you find a
p19583
aVlogically correct and scientifically ascertainable way  then we say this is yoga
p19584
aVyoga means
p19585
aVin search in pursuit of human wellbeing we've been doing all kinds of things we've been looking up for a long time
p19586
aVwhich has led to
p19587
aVhumanity being divided in the name of
p19588
aVreligion scarce creeds in so many different ways
p19589
aVnow in the last 50 years i would say we are looking out seriously and
p19590
aVwe are ripping the planet apart
p19591
aVall the environmental degradation that we are talking about is just in pursuit of human wellbeing
p19592
aVin the last hundred years
p19593
aVdefinitely  we are the most comfortable generation ever
p19594
aVbut we cannot say we are well
p19595
aVbecause we hit not really well people are not happy people are not peaceful
p19596
aVthat is not happening because we have not at rest in nature  so when it when you address it in a scientific manner
p19597
aVrather than by belief by philosophy by
p19598
aVideologies you address human well being in a scientific way  this is yoga
p19599
aVthe word yoga literally means union when we say union what we're talking about is we are talking about a
p19600
aVscientific way of obliterating your the boundaries of your individuality
p19601
aVwhen i say a scientific way of obliterating the boundaries of your individual nature what this means is
p19602
aVright now as we sit here  this is me that is you distinctly clear  but we are breathing the same air
p19603
aVwe are we are a product of the same earth
p19604
aVwhat you call as myself is just a pop up on this planet and it will pop out
p19605
aVbut in this little bit of time  we have divided this in such a way that we can't meet
p19606
aVyoga means you obliterate
p19607
aVthis individual boundaries not intellectually not by belief not by ideology  but as a living experience
p19608
aVwill be launched  i mean this was there in the video  we launched a very large scale
p19609
aVenvironmental project in southern india
p19610
aVthe fundamental for this came from this
p19611
aVthis happened to me when i was in the university and
p19612
aVrecently about eight years ago when i when i happened to be in my hometown and
p19613
aVafter a very long time one of my english teachers came up to me and said now
p19614
aVi understand why you would not let me teach robert frost i said ma'am
p19615
aVwhy would i not let you teach robert frost i like robert frost
p19616
aVshe said don't you remember you didn't let me teach frost then i remembered
p19617
aVshe came one day till then we were reading only english poets
p19618
aVshe came and introduced the american poet and she said robert frost is a great man  and then she started off woods are lovely dark
p19619
aVand deep i said stop i
p19620
aVsaid a man who calls a tree a wood i don't want to listen to this guy
p19621
aVshe
p19622
aVshe said no  no this is a very great point  i said i don't care how great  he is he calls tree a wood i
p19623
aVdon't want to listen to him
p19624
aVthen when we wanted to start this
p19625
aVprocess in southern india when we found that rivers were going dry and the groundwater was sinking very rapidly
p19626
aVwhen i decided we will plant 114 million trees in tamil  nadu
p19627
aVthe simple thing that we did was i took thousands of people made them sit in the trees
p19628
aVand we set up a yogic process with which they experienced that what they are breathing out
p19629
aVthe trees are inhaling what the trees are exhaling they're inhaling and they realized one half of the lungs is hanging out there
p19630
aVonce they realize this there is no stopping
p19631
aVeven today millions of trees are being planted on a yearly basis all done by common people
p19632
aVsimply because we brought this yogic experience to them that they truly
p19633
aVrealized that one half of their breathing apparatus is actually out there not here
p19634
aVso bringing this experience into people that what you think as myself is not
p19635
aVwithin the boundaries of your physical nature it goes well beyond that if this becomes a living reality
p19636
aVthen fulfilling these goals that united nations has for the world is
p19637
aVbecomes much more possible than the way it is right now where we are trying to push in one way
p19638
aVbut a whole lot of people are pushing in the opposite direction because they don't even see it as  
p19639
aVthank you  sir  guru i wanted to
p19640
aVpoint out this incredible thing about the tree planting project is that sud guru 
p19641
aVinsisted that the trees be planted on small plots of land less than half an acre and
p19642
aVhalf of the trees are fruit trees
p19643
aVand then half of them can be used for firewood so that the people who live on these lands are
p19644
aVbenefited from them they take care of the trees and those trees actually really grow and
p19645
aVone of the things that that's really working on is is poverty and
p19646
aVwhen i look at the world today  and i see
p19647
aVespecially in the united states this
p19648
aVincredible gap between people who have capital and people who don't and
p19649
aVi it's a it's a very disturbing sign to me that this the gap between rich and poor
p19650
aVcan you talk a little bit about how yoga would address that in terms of sustainable development 
p19651
aVcivilians to understand this that we have chosen it cannot an economic model  which is all about everybody for himself or herself
p19652
aVthere is no larger commitment to humanity as such because that is market economy
p19653
aVeverybody does according to their own
p19654
aVcapabilities and skills and grab what they can grab it's literally
p19655
aVshootings good economy  but we have gone for this simply because
p19656
aVthe
p19657
aVsocialistic communistic
p19658
aVideas have unfortunately failed not necessarily because they're bad because human beings are not ready for it yet
p19659
aVthat is
p19660
aVpoor people who had nothing wanted to share the rich never wanted to share
p19661
aVso it became a joke in the world if the rich had to if rich had the consciousness to share
p19662
aVcommunism would have been a great idea
p19663
aVbut the poor want to share rich don't want to share so that is the same situation here
p19664
aVand this is the same situation building up everywhere else in the world
p19665
aVthis is the best way to run the world no  but do we have a better idea
p19666
aVno  so who because right now  we are in that place  so the only thing that we can truly do is
p19667
aVthat we bring  what is this what we are referring to as yoga as a living experience
p19668
aVyoga does not mean twisting your body
p19669
aVyoga does not mean standing on your head yoga does not mean holding your breath
p19670
aVyoga means in some way you have transcended the limitations of your physical nature you are beginning to experience life as a
p19671
aVlarger possibility not just this physical form that you are once this becomes a living experience
p19672
aVsharing and living together we become a common experience everywhere
p19673
aVdoes it mean we are going to start communes and everybody will live together no we can run
p19674
aVbusinesses in a more inclusive way we can create a more inclusive
p19675
aVeconomic model and this need not be done by government policy this can be done by private individuals
p19676
aVbecause there are companies which are almost as large as nations today
p19677
aVthere are companies which budgets which are bigger than nations  so it is very much possible
p19678
aVthat business can be run in a more inclusive way right now
p19679
aVwe are thinking only of profit our idea of profit is very
p19680
aVshort term kind of idea
p19681
aVif you really want to run your company if you are thinking in terms of your company prospering in the next 100
p19682
aV200 500 years continuously
p19683
aVthen it's very important that you make your customer your partner that you make everybody else in the society your partner
p19684
aVwhatever you are manufacturing or whatever you're selling or whatever the business sees
p19685
aVwhether you're selling a safety pin or a computer or a spacecraft
p19686
aVessentially the business is about human well being
p19687
aVif this is
p19688
aVthis comes into the consciousness of every business person if this comes into the consciousness of building every business that
p19689
aVessentially this is about human wellbeing  we do it in so many ways  but fundamentally
p19690
aVit's about that if this awareness and consciousness is instilled in the businesses on the planet
p19691
aVthen you can find the capitalistic way of living need not mean disparity can mean well being to everybody
p19692
aVsadhguru i read the other day that
p19693
aVthat for every dollar in government investment
p19694
aVthat in developing countries that there's  7 00 now in private investment
p19695
aVso
p19696
aVhow do we use yoga to 
p19697
aVyoke in the the private corporations that are looking just at their bottom line to end up really having development
p19698
aVthat's fair and just
p19699
aVin the last 20 years i have
p19700
aVlargely focused on the business leaders because
p19701
aVthere was a time a few hundred years ago where the most influential leadership on the planet was religious leadership 
p19702
aVlater on when the military machines
p19703
aVbuilt up in a big way the military leaders dominated the world in the last hundred years
p19704
aVdemocratically elected leaders have become the most dominant force in the next 15 to 25 years
p19705
aVyou will see the business leaders will be the most important or influential leadership on the planet
p19706
aVthe good thing about business is that a
p19707
aVbusinessman is willing to make a deal if the deal is good no matter who you are
p19708
aVi'm saying the old prejudice of i cannot make a deal with somebody is going away  and they're willing to make a deal now
p19709
aVanything is sustainable only if it is beneficial to both the parties
p19710
aVnothing can be sustained either in the marketplace or in marriage unless it's beneficial to both the parties
p19711
aVonly when it's truly beneficial to both the parties this can be sustained
p19712
aVthis is slowly sinking into the business leadership  i have seen in the last 20 years
p19713
aVprominent business leaders their way of thinking is very very different than what it was
p19714
aVmy essential work has been to move individual leaders from their personal ambitions to a larger vision
p19715
aVbecause a larger vision means
p19716
aVthen the business is
p19717
aVsustainable for a long period of time if it's just your personal ambition the world will work against you if you have a larger vision
p19718
aVthe world will work with you  this is a big difference
p19719
aVso this is something that is slowly sinking and you will see if you see annual meetings of major
p19720
aVbusinesses what they're talking if you look at the world economic forum if you look at various economic
p19721
aVyou know assemblies on the planet you will see they're all
p19722
aVbeginning to talk about a larger vision how to make a difference rather than how to make a profit
p19723
aVthis is become the language of the business these days it still has to manifest in a big way
p19724
aVbut at least the language has changed from profit to making a difference
p19725
aVthank you  sadhguru when you look at societies all across the world there  there's a huge gap between
p19726
aVwhat's available to women and what's available to men 
p19727
ag19657
aVsustainable development goals address this how
p19728
aVwhat's the role of gender equality in yoga 
p19729
aVthe yoga means transcending your physical nature on one level
p19730
aVif you transcend your physical nature where is the question of being a male or a female 
p19731
aVyou being a male or a female is relevant only in a few spaces in your life in bathrooms and bedrooms
p19732
aVrest of the places i don't see why you should recognize somebody as a man or a woman
p19733
aVwhy are we identifying people with reproductive organs if you must use a body part at least use the brain
p19734
aVi
p19735
aVthink a
p19736
aVsmall gender difference that is there between us to fulfill a certain aspect of our life is being stretched too far i
p19737
aVthink this is from another period where it was not possible for a woman to participate 
p19738
aVbecause of variety of physical situations in the world
p19739
aVand that is largely leveled today in most parts of the world and it's rapidly changing everywhere  i would say
p19740
aVi think a more active effort is needed at least by law in most nations it is 100 percent equal
p19741
aVby practice there is still
p19742
aVdiscrepancies which has to be worked at i feel it's a generational thing
p19743
aVonce the older generation moves out the anger generation is not looking at it that way anymore at least i see that in all the
p19744
aVasian countries it is only people beyond 60 years of age who think on in this mode the
p19745
aVyounger people are not thinking that way anymore
p19746
aVso grow
p19747
aVi'm just going to ask you one more question because i want to save time for the audience
p19748
aVwho've been waiting to talk to you and i 
p19749
aVcan you
p19750
aVtell about how you conceived the world in 30 years
p19751
aVwhat i see is for the first time for the very first time in the history of humanity
p19752
aVhuman intellect is sparking like never before
p19753
aVmore people in the planet today can think for themselves than ever before in the history of this
p19754
aVhuman existence
p19755
aVso once human intellect begins to spark like this
p19756
aVunless something is logically correct and scientifically verifiable
p19757
aVit will fail in future you may be willing to listen to a few things
p19758
aVbut your children are not going to listen to anything that does not make sense to them it does not matter
p19759
aVfrom what authority it comes from or in other words  we are moving into an era
p19760
aVwhere
p19761
aVauthority cannot be the truth
p19762
aVtruth will be the only authority in future  we are getting there because ever buddy is beginning to ask
p19763
aVquestions  and people are not afraid to ask questions anymore  so this is bound to happen once this happens
p19764
aVhuman
p19765
aVaspiration for wellbeing has to have a logically correct and scientifically ascertainable
p19766
aVmethodology  and it's a matter of tremendous
p19767
aVimportance that today the international yoga day has been
p19768
aVdeclared in the last one year it was mooted by the prime minister
p19769
aVbut it was almost like the world was waiting for it as they mentioned
p19770
aV177 countries never before
p19771
aVin the history of united nations all of them agreed upon one thing as they agreed upon yoga
p19772
aVit looked like they were waiting for it  yes  the world has been waiting for a scientific and a logically correct
p19773
aVsolution for human wellbeing the aspiration for human wellbeing will not stop
p19774
aVunless we provide a proper scientifically structured
p19775
aVmethodology
p19776
aVthan people in terms of well being will move towards chemicals
p19777
aVthis is a deep a grave concern in the world the number of people moving towards alcohol and drugs in the last 25 years
p19778
aVmust be maybe 500 2 000 percent more than what it was 25 years ago
p19779
aVthis is mainly because in pursuit of human wellbeing
p19780
aVthere are no logically correct answers to their questions
p19781
aVthat is the reason why human beings are seeking these kind of solutions
p19782
aVunless we provide this
p19783
aVthis is a natural progression  i see in the next 30 years to 50 years there will be a big moment towards a
p19784
aVscientific process for inner well being and this is the right time to be here at this
p19785
aVforum and
p19786
aVthis yoga becoming a worldwide thing we must understand yoga is not an indian thing
p19787
aVif you want to call yoga  indian  then you must call gravity european  okay 
p19788
aVbecause yes it it originated from that place because
p19789
aVindia is one place where for a few  millennia  we had
p19790
aVuninterrupted time to look deep in words and
p19791
aVto look at the human mechanism in at most profoundness as to how this functions  what is the ultimate 
p19792
aVpossibility within this human mechanism  this is taken a few
p19793
aVmillennia to understand and arrive at this possibility and
p19794
aVyoga i want this message to go the science of yoga is not just about health
p19795
aVit's not just about fitness it is an ultimate solution for every aspect of human existence
p19796
aVthere is different types of yoga's yoga can be taught in different
p19797
aVdimensions the ultimate possibility of
p19798
aVraising beyond our physical nature the ultimate possibility of knowing life in its fullest way
p19799
aVthe word yoga means union the word yoga means
p19800
aVone who has
p19801
aVexperienced this union  we
p19802
aVneed not 1 to 5 yogi's we need millions of them who have a sense of union with the rest of the universe
p19803
aVparticularly those who hold
p19804
aVresponsible positions in the world they must come to this experience because leadership
p19805
aVessentially means you have the privilege of touching other people's lives
p19806
aVwhat you think what you feel when what you do every single thought emotion and action
p19807
aVeither makes or breaks people's lives  that's what leadership means
p19808
aVwhen you are given such a privilege
p19809
aVit's very very important that you are in a state of yoga that you experience life around you as yourself
p19810
aVif we if any of us feel the work
p19811
aVthat we are doing is important the first and foremost thing is we must work upon ourselves
p19812
aVit gives me deep honor and pleasure to first give the floor to
p19813
aVundersecretary general
p19814
aVambassador bejoy  nambiar who will also be delivering a message on behalf of the secretary general  mr  ban ki moon
p19815
aVi shall just be delivering the message of the secretary general
p19816
aVon tomorrow's international day of yoga
p19817
aVyoga is an ancient physical mental and spiritual practice that
p19818
aVoriginated in india and is now practiced in various forms around the world
p19819
aVthe word yoga derives from sanskrit and means to join to or to unite
p19820
aVsymbolizing the union of body and consciousness
p19821
aVyoga balances body and soul physical health and mental well being it promotes
p19822
aVhow many among people and between ourselves in the natural world 
p19823
aVrecognizing its universal appeal the united nations general assembly proclaimed
p19824
aV21st june as the international day of yoga
p19825
aVthis year's observance of the international day of yoga highlights the important role
p19826
aVhealthy living plays in the realization of the sustainable development goals
p19827
aVadopted last year by all 193
p19828
aVunited nations member states as
p19829
aVexercise yoga has multiple benefits
p19830
aVphysical inactivity is linked with a number of non communicable diseases such as cancer diabetes and
p19831
aVcardiovascular diseases which are among the leading causes of illness and death worldwide by improving fitness
p19832
aVteaching us how to breathe correctly and working to diminish stress yoga can help to cultivate 
p19833
aVhealthier
p19834
aVlifestyles
p19835
aVpracticing yoga can also help raise awareness of our role as
p19836
aVconsumers of the planet's resources and as individuals with a duty to respect and live in peace with our neighbors
p19837
aVall these elements are essential to building a sustainable future of dignity and opportunity
p19838
aVfor all on
p19839
aVthe international day of yoga tomorrow  i urge everyone to embrace healthier choices and lifestyles
p19840
aVto commit to unity with our fellow human beings regardless of ethnicity
p19841
aVfaith age gender identity or sexual orientation
p19842
aVlet us celebrate this day and every day as members of one human family sharing one common
p19843
aVprecious home
p19844
aVthank you
p19845
aVmay i now give the floor to the permanent representative of bangladesh sir 
p19846
aVwe deeply appreciate the indian government's initiative to have the international day of yoga
p19847
aVwe have learnt a lot from the yoga masters
p19848
aVespecially the perspective as to how yoga can contribute in the attainment of global peace
p19849
aVsustainable future and in turn the realization of the sdgs
p19850
aVwhat i understand without peace of mind and harmony in the body  how can we think we can change the world 
p19851
aVfirst we have to change our own world
p19852
aVby which what i mean is how we leave 
p19853
aVbreathe eat
p19854
aVthink and aspire if we are not fit for the purpose of contributing to sustainable peace in the world
p19855
aVwe will remain as bystanders and not as active
p19856
aVagents of change i can share my own story with my colleagues and others present here
p19857
aVi had been suffering from a very bad bout of sciatica problem for the last two months at times the pain was
p19858
aVdebilitating i have gone through serious pain medication followed by physical therapy and acupuncture
p19859
aVin fact i am just coming here from my sixth session of acupuncture treatment i
p19860
aVrealized that i suffered this problem
p19861
aVbecause of accumulated lifestyle related problems which included long hours of sitting standing
p19862
aVstress from the work and also from the family for the constant change of places of postings etc
p19863
aVduring the last eight weeks of my ordeal i reflected on my life and future course of action
p19864
aVi read a lot and search the internet for answers
p19865
aVand i finally came to the conclusion that yoga is the answer to my situation
p19866
aValthough i did some yoga in my college days my biggest mistake was i that i discontinued that
p19867
aVperhaps if i continued i would have never faced my present predicament
p19868
aVnow the bhujangasana or cobra position
p19869
aVwhich is also known as mckenzie something is critical for the health of my spine there are many other essence or
p19870
aVpositions which can help me get my strength back as i feel a little better and able to practice those
p19871
aVthe essence will not only help gain my physical strength
p19872
aVbut it will contribute to my mental strength through the meditational aspects of yoga
p19873
aVi thought i'll share my most recent experience
p19874
aVso that others like me in similar lifestyle situations can also learn and prevent the situation that i am in
p19875
aVlet's do yoga every day and not just one day in the year  thank you
p19876
aVmay i no offer the floor to the distinguished permanent representative of georgia excellency  i was thinking about asking
p19877
aVquestions  but in fact it's not as much as asking questions
p19878
aVbut how what you told us echoes in in all of us and
p19879
aVit really does it really does because what we what we take from here
p19880
aVfrom all this wonderful conversation that that we just had is how
p19881
aVcomplex things are indeed very simple
p19882
aVif we
p19883
aVindeed try to
p19884
aVas a
p19885
aVperson who is really honored and humbled to be here as a representative of my country who was one of the
p19886
aV177 who co sponsored
p19887
aVyoga international day
p19888
aVi'm an also a practitioner rather a very bad student to the school that i'm
p19889
aVattending
p19890
aVthat school is called yoga in daily life  which is in united states in many parts of eastern europe particularly
p19891
aVheadquartered in rajasthan in katou
p19892
aVled by vishwa guru sri swami maharaja nanda ji and what i learned from my
p19893
aVpersonal experience because after all the oneness is sharing this personal experiences also is
p19894
aVwhat patanjali said that it's about 
p19895
aVhaving your mind free of disturbances  and if we indeed attain to be free of disturbances
p19896
aVwe find peace with our mind that can really transcend and
p19897
aVsomehow start this chain reaction of
p19898
aVpeacefulness and oneness that we all long for particularly in in this
p19899
aVorganization
p19900
aVi'm glad that we have so many colleagues by now or calling from
p19901
aVbangladesh my good friend who sits next to me is also
p19902
aVavid yoga
p19903
aVpractitioner and many and it is indeed
p19904
aVprobably high time what you just mentioned when prime minister of india 
p19905
aVsaid that we needed
p19906
aVinternational day of yoga it came in date on the right right time and i'm glad that i was here on the right moment and
p19907
aVright time thank you for your presence here
p19908
aVthank you for your blessing and indeed if we try to i think we can really attain that
p19909
aVwe are without disturbance
p19910
aVand we find this oneness and unity and we take those
p19911
aV17 goals one by one and i really hope to and i'm looking forward to that day where we will no longer have this beautiful
p19912
aVposter
p19913
aVbehind you because we will have that
p19914
aVcompleted because sdg is in a way to me is
p19915
aVsomehow
p19916
aVmanifestation of our common failure too that we have to talk about as dg's
p19917
aVbut it's good that we are starting to talk about it
p19918
aVand we are making it happen hopefully and i believe in that yoga will create that
p19919
aVthat will permeate our work in this organization in this chamber and other words  thank you very much on shanti
p19920
aVokay  now open the floor to the distinguished permanent
p19921
aVrepresentative of liechtenstein excellency you have the floor i came from the probably most non
p19922
aVspiritual angle possible to yoga i was essentially dragged against my will 17 years ago
p19923
aVby a den girlfriend into yoga class and
p19924
aVyou know i viewed myself as this
p19925
aVbig soccer player and cyclist and all these other things and thought really this is not for me and
p19926
aVto my credit i had to say already after the class well  there is something there
p19927
aVand that is something that is worth exploring  i've been doing yoga ever since and
p19928
aVif there's one thing that i believe i will be doing until the end of my life  it is yoga because everyone can do it
p19929
aVevery person of every age of every state of health really
p19930
aVyoga is for everyone which is i think one of its wonderful
p19931
aVqualities
p19932
aVthe other thing is even if you come from that non spiritual place that i came from
p19933
aVyou realize over time that something happens with you  and that there isn't it there is for me today
p19934
aVno  other way of
p19935
aVconnecting with myself with my mind
p19936
aVwith my body
p19937
aVthe way i can in yoga sometimes i find out in when i do yoga that i before i did it
p19938
aVi didn't know how i was that day at the moment  i do it
p19939
aVi do i feel how i am and i'm able to connect to myself and that's also
p19940
aVi think really the precondition for being able to connect to connect
p19941
aVwith others i
p19942
aVyou know in looking at the theme and in thinking about this
p19943
aVfor me the connection is very simple
p19944
aVthe sdg agenda
p19945
aVyou know tells us  we know what the problems are
p19946
aVwe know what the solutions are 
p19947
aVwe have to simply change our ways to get there  and then we can do this together
p19948
aVand i think this is ryoga can make a huge contribution
p19949
aVif you think it's not for you try it one time and
p19950
aVi think it will be for many of you actually i think it is for everybody and
p19951
aVone of my you know small moments of happiness in life today is to take a person to yoga
p19952
aVbecause that just makes you happy
p19953
aVand this is why i'm offering a class tomorrow morning to some of your permit to some of you in the room
p19954
aVand you're going to come say it with many others  and i really look forward to that  thank you so much
p19955
aVfor now i have the honor to recognize another yoga master
p19956
aVwe have with us in fact yoga matta keiko  i cover has joined us for this event all the way from japan
p19957
aVshe not been a sama
p19958
aVin da state distinguished guests your excellencies ladies and gentlemen
p19959
aVspiritually i come from a tradition and lineage that from the time immemorial
p19960
aVhave kept and shared with humanity the teachings of yoga
p19961
aVyoga is a science that especially with meditation
p19962
aVfacilitates the harmony of the body the emotions in the mind
p19963
aVwhen these elements are in harmony the individual becomes calm and peaceful in his heart if
p19964
aVthe individual is calm and peaceful in his heart this permeates in the community and thus in the world i
p19965
aVcan attest from my own experience that by learning 
p19966
aVthese practices it is possible for everyone to awaken your own energies and achieve peace love and harmony i
p19967
aVdeeply believe that if that if we as individuals feel peace and harmony in ourselves that
p19968
aVthis will lead to love and peace being spread throughout the world  i thank you very much for enabling me to be present today
p19969
ag19845
aVyoga matter for that message of love may i now offer the floor to the distinguished permanent representative of nepal i
p19970
aVcome from nepal from the eastern hills of nepal a place in an environment
p19971
aVwhich is extremely conducive for yoga  and i also come from a family and community
p19972
aVpracticing yoga  but then i'm always worried about this question of accessibility
p19973
aVit has to do with the commercialization of yoga today
p19974
aVthe commercialization and hundreds and thousands of the different types of yoga
p19975
aVgetting into the heads of young minds and and different easy's of people
p19976
aVmostly also in terms of fashion in the forms of fashion
p19977
aVwhat would be you wise guidance to us 
p19978
aVto deal with the perhaps unnecessary or over
p19979
aVcommercialization of
p19980
aVyoga
p19981
aVwhatever becomes reasonably popular there will be enterprise around that
p19982
aVyou shouldn't be surprised when you step out on the
p19983
aVtime square people will be selling yoga t shirts and yoga whatever whatever  okay 
p19984
aVwe shouldn't be distracted or disturbed by these things this is a part of a social thing it happens
p19985
aVat the same time the core of yoga is not disturbed in any way on the surface there are
p19986
aVsmall distortions here and there i
p19987
aVwould say for the larger public to start with
p19988
aVlike this year when you know about four months ago
p19989
aVwhen i came to know that over 9 000 children below 18 years of age committed suicide in india and
p19990
aVall
p19991
aV1 700 below 13 years of age committed suicide
p19992
aVit i just thought
p19993
aVif our children start committing suicide we are doing something fundamentally wrong a
p19994
aVchild is a fresh life a child is an exuberant life a
p19995
aVchild should be a bundle of joy
p19996
aVinstead of that they're deciding to take their own life which is deeply disturbing
p19997
aVthis is not a statement about the child who took his life  but this is a statement about all of us
p19998
aVwhat are we doing with our societies 
p19999
aVso after cough i said let's touch 10 000 schools
p20000
aVbut today with the cooperation of various state governments  we are touching nearly 30 000 schools over 20 million children
p20001
aVwhy i'm saying this is why this has become possible is
p20002
aVbecause we are offering what is called as oppa yoga 
p20003
aVoopah yoga means pre yoga or sub yoga why this effort towards opu giri's 
p20004
aVif you offer yoga however  innocuous the practice may look to start with it has a spiritual dimension to it
p20005
aVtransmitting spiritual dimension to an unconscious population  we're not ready for it and
p20006
aVwithout a certain level of expertise in the teachers could be responsible over a period of time  so
p20007
aVwe are teaching oppa yoga which has mainly
p20008
aVphysiological and psychological benefits and
p20009
aVhere you can't do anything wrong
p20010
aVit's on the video all the teacher has to do is make corrections and make sure people are not doing it wrong i
p20011
aVthink it's a good way to spread yoga in the world is true yoga
p20012
aVoopah yoga the word for yoga in indian languages today has acquired the meaning of being useful
p20013
aVbut actually it originates from this that it's a pre yoga or sub yoga or a
p20014
aVstart up start up yoga it is and it's best to start that way with large populations because when you start off an
p20015
aVunconscious spiritual process for people
p20016
aVmany of them may not be ready for it
p20017
aVeven if it's a good thing even if good thing happens to you when you're not ready for it things may not work very well
p20018
ag19696
aVoopah yoga is a very
p20019
aVdistinct way and a safe way to take yoga to the world
p20020
aVlarge scale after this happens once they feel the benefits once they experience  what difference
p20021
aVit makes they will naturally seek yoga in a more
p20022
aVserious manner and that is when yoga should come into their lives this could saw the concern that you expressed
p20023
aVbut at the same time somebody is doing something funny in the name of yoga
p20024
aVit doesn't concern me because those things will always happen
p20025
aVbut it's good that even commercial establishments are talking yoga  this means  it's really on i
p20026
aVwill now call upon mr  herman bravo who is the president of the yoga club right here at the un mr 
p20027
aVbravo you have the floor
p20028
aVyoga is more than an instrument of personal transformation
p20029
aVyoga has as many of the speakers have mentioned
p20030
aVparticularly sadhguru a
p20031
aVsocial dimension all that because the word yoga as tao remember us yoga means union
p20032
aVunion between the body and the mind
p20033
aVunion between us and other human beings
p20034
aVunion between human beings and nature and it is because of that
p20035
aVinterdependence and that
p20036
aVinterconnection that
p20037
aVwe are able to solve many of the problems  we have many problems  but we have to be optimistic because the solution is
p20038
aVby changing ourselves
p20039
aVmany of these strategies organized by the un they have a political
p20040
aVmeaning they have a technology access to technologies
p20041
aVand they have the will at the political level
p20042
aVbut all that is not going to work unless we go at the individual level
p20043
aVyoga means personal transformation and because of that
p20044
aVthe international day of yoga should be a wonderful opportunity
p20045
aVto remind all of us that every day in our life should be a yoga day namaste  thank
p20046
aVyou i now give the floor to mr 
p20047
aVnate erman of the who is the executive director of the office of the world health organization here at the united nations
p20048
aVmiss barrat  do you have the flow 
p20049
aVit's a great pleasure and an honor to attend
p20050
aVcelebration today and indeed this is a very unusual event for the united nations because it is deeply reflective
p20051
aVand it's not
p20052
aVcomposed of a prayer
p20053
aVprepared speeches that people deliver in a more formal way
p20054
aVit actually moves all of us here to think deeply of what is being said  what is being done 
p20055
aVwhat is being conveyed by you here 
p20056
aVand how we can individually and collectively respond to this poll of the international yoga day  i
p20057
aVhave spent five years of my life in india before coming here in new york  and of course for me  it's something very
p20058
aVspecial to be here today at this day and
p20059
aVit's special because i
p20060
aVyou mentioned
p20061
aVsadhguru that we cannot call or
p20062
aVcompare and say that yoga is indian
p20063
aVbut it comes from india and indeed it is india's gift to the
p20064
aVhumankind to all over the world and it is very special because of that and i could see
p20065
ag19657
aVimpact of yoga practice on
p20066
aVcommunities in india so it makes a different
p20067
aVdifference  and this is why this is such a great gift of civilization
p20068
aVthe whole country in india every quarter of it breathes essence of yoga and it is the civilization
p20069
aVcalm of yoga that has moved me when i was there
p20070
aVin my work  we are dealing with health issues  it is no news now that yoga is very good for health
p20071
aVbut we also know now that health is no longer standalone
p20072
aVone of the sustainable development goals it is actually determinant for any other goal to to be achieved
p20073
aVtherefore yoga has a very different meaning and different indeed interconnecting nature because it does
p20074
aVhelp people to feel better
p20075
aVyou better breathe better act better
p20076
aVunite better come into
p20077
aVinterconnectedness which is indeed essential for sustaining our planet and connects planet to people 
p20078
aVso therefore of course
p20079
aVwe know today 
p20080
aVproven through many clinical trials that
p20081
aVyoga helps in many conditions mental health conditions
p20082
aVdepression heart conditions many other conditions joint and and so on so this is not new but
p20083
aVthere has been
p20084
aVtraditional resistance to integrate yoga practice and other perhaps
p20085
aVtraditional medicine practices which are of course available worldwide but known also in india
p20086
aVto integrate them to the allopathic
p20087
aVmedicine and
p20088
aVthis resistance is slowly being overcome we as w cho are trying to put our
p20089
aVour
p20090
aVsupport into this process
p20091
aVrecently this year in may in fact
p20092
aVindia has signed and i would say landmark agreement with the world health organization to promote traditional
p20093
aVmedicine yoga included and to ensure quality and safety of these traditional practices
p20094
aVbut more so to
p20095
aVintegrate these practices into our
p20096
aVhealth services
p20097
aVprimary health care and all other services that we know so it is now
p20098
aVdeeply understood that as all of human beings need some or another kind of health services
p20099
aVbe it vaccination if if they are very healthy or any other more serious
p20100
aVservices they also need to practice yoga because it prevents many illnesses it also gives peace of mind
p20101
aVit
p20102
aVteaches us how to cope with all those 
p20103
aVdifferent things that modern life
p20104
aVstress puts on human brain and therefore  we
p20105
aVstand forward and we want to support promotion and include version of yoga into
p20106
aVmedical practice all over the world we will collaborate with india on that
p20107
aVbut my question to to you would be is there any good secret beyond of what you have said 
p20108
aVhow we can bring these different dimensions of health together integrate them in a better way and
p20109
aVmake sure that yoga is no longer seen as something separate from
p20110
aVfrom what we do in health services traditionally  thank you  thank you very much for being here today
p20111
aVwhen
p20112
aVour commitment has to shift to health not to a particular system
p20113
aVpeople are married to a particular system most of the time and they defend that system at any cost no matter what 
p20114
aVevery system in the world has something to contribute
p20115
aVbut in so being committed to health we are committed to those systems because of this there has been a lot of
p20116
aVdislocation in how health can come about
p20117
aVso in southern india in the rural part of
p20118
aVtamil  nadu we brought this about
p20119
aVthese five dimensions
p20120
aVallopathy
p20121
aVsita
p20122
aVayurveda unani and yoga together
p20123
aVpractice along with the naturopathy way of doing things it is done miraculous things to the populations
p20124
aVwe were the first pilot project by the irish
p20125
aVproject when it started 10 years ago now  i should become a ministry
p20126
aVi think yesterday or in the last week they have declared a eyes university which means ayurveda yoga
p20127
aVsit down and all these things put together
p20128
aVthis we started almost 15 years ago on today
p20129
aVit is an active part what we have done is we have medical vans which go with a an
p20130
aValiphatic doctor  and i sit the doctor plus  we have created over
p20131
aVone hundred and twelve  or thirteen
p20132
aVvillage gardens where we grow herbs over 100 and odd 
p20133
aVdifferent types of herbs in a common piece of land where people are taught how to make use of it for small things like
p20134
aVstomachache headache fever for the children diarrhea these kind of things all our grandmothers knew how to treat this
p20135
aVunfortunately even for these people are going to the doctors today and
p20136
aVthe way it is being treated with elaborate medication
p20137
aVgenerally in rural  india
p20138
aVthe cost of the medicine if you fall sick for 15 days it takes a year for you to recover
p20139
aVwith the economics of the family gets hit for almost a year
p20140
aVif 15 days somebody's down and they visit the doctor and the volume of medication and treatment that happens kind of
p20141
aVeconomically sets them back quite a bit  so we our
p20142
aVcommitment is to health not to a particular system and
p20143
aVright now the government of india is doing serious efforts to integrate this thing and
p20144
aVwe've been doing this for over 15 years very effectively
p20145
aVi must tell you a simple thing in rural  india which can be i was just last one week
p20146
aVi was in africa even there  i thought this is something that will work  we created  what is called as a wave of health
p20147
aVabout simple things how health can be created with within the family for every family
p20148
aVone of the things that was done
p20149
aVi won't go into all the details one simple thing with it was
p20150
aVevery home should have a papaya tree a banana tree a moringa  tree and a patch of greens
p20151
aVthis transformed health situations in such a big way
p20152
aVyou won't believe such a small initiative such a simple initiative  what a difference
p20153
aVit is done to people's lives like this small initiative can be brought because
p20154
aVconsidering the economics of those families  it's very important  we need to come up with solutions
p20155
aVthat works for them in this yoga practice has a significant role because
p20156
aVcreating a vibrant
p20157
aVhealthy vibrant and effervescent
p20158
aVpopulation is very very important to fulfill the sustainable goals if we don't create that kind of population
p20159
aVwe will be only talking about sustainability  it will not happen  we need to create this and the goal is
p20160
aVthe tools of self transformation should not be in the hands of a guru or an
p20161
aVorganization or some other authority the idea is to bring this into everybody's life like today
p20162
aVeverybody owns a toothbrush which is created oral health just like that everybody should have
p20163
aVsome tools for self transformation it is with this kind of
p20164
aVcommitment that we are going ahead and
p20165
aVthere is a big support now in the world wherever we go in the remotest parts of africa
p20166
aVthat i was there in the last one week it was incredible to see that all of them know about yoga
p20167
aVi know this twenty five years ago when i went into rural india in a big way
p20168
aVthey knew what is coca cola  but they did not know  what is yoga 
p20169
aVbut today in the remotest part of africa people know  what is yoga  this is transformation in many ways
p20170
aVthank you said gucci  and how would you like to reflect on this questions like to thank you all you 
p20171
aVthere's been so much beauty in this room and so much intelligence that of
p20172
aVwhat the world is all about and what we are all about and what we're going to do about it and
p20173
aVi think that
p20174
aVit's so it's
p20175
aVabsolutely fantastic to sit here and listen
p20176
aVto all of the things that i pondered for so many years and wondered about
p20177
aVnot always finding the answers
p20178
aVbut today was a revelation and a very special thing to happen to the whole world in
p20179
aVthis room you've started something
p20180
aVthat we've needed for a long time  it's out in the open now
p20181
aVyoga is beautiful
p20182
aVbut yoga's only beautiful if we use it and we make it part of our lives
p20183
aVi want to thank your i
p20184
aVnow give the floor to mr  rajeev leela  who has joined us all the way from texas
p20185
aVif you could help us understand the role of a guru of a teacher not in the true academy sense where
p20186
aVstem
p20187
aVprofessor teaches me science and technology  but rather
p20188
aVcoming from humanity and that you know that that union among all of us
p20189
aVwhen you say i said guru you're saying an uneducated guru
p20190
aVthat's what it means
p20191
aVbecause
p20192
aVyou don't come to set the guru to know about the scriptures you don't come to set the guru to know about rituals
p20193
aVbecause the only thing that i know is i know this piece of life from its origin to its ultimate and this all i know
p20194
aVby knowing this by inference  you know just about everything because
p20195
aVeverything is made the same way
p20196
aVtoday there is something called as a constructional theory where they're talking about how the atom and the cosmos are essentially
p20197
aVfundamentally same design only the sophistication and complexity is multiplying
p20198
aVso there may be on the you and me are made the same way only the complexity has multiplied
p20199
aVhaving said that
p20200
aVin what way is a guru relevant means 
p20201
aVyou trying to walk an uncharted terrain 
p20202
aVevery year i trek in the himalayas in nepal and tibet
p20203
aVonce you go into the mountains
p20204
aVthat illiterate sherpa who is there who has not been to school 
p20205
aVbut who if he says right you turn right  if he says left you turn left you better do that otherwise you won't come back
p20206
aVyou do that because he knows the terrain
p20207
aVthe same goes for this
p20208
aVthis is just an inner terrain  it's best to walk with somebody who's already walked the path
p20209
ag19494
aVsimple things will become complicated  what is next door you will go around the world and come back to it 
p20210
aVall this complication about for example
p20211
aVtoday if you are to the word meditation people think something very difficult to do
p20212
aVto put it simply first of all the word meditation english word meditation does not describe anything in particular
p20213
aVif you sit with your eyes closed  they're saying you're meditating
p20214
aVwith your eyes closed you can do japeth aparna dhyana samadhi junya
p20215
aVthere are any number of things you could do or you might have just mastered the art of sleeping in vertical postures
p20216
aVit happens
p20217
ag19696
aVwhen we say meditation we must understand it's not an act  it is a quality
p20218
aVit is like you want flowers in your garden if you want flowers in your garden
p20219
aVyou don't have to sit there and do flower meditation
p20220
aVyou don't have to think flowers you have to think soil  men your water sunlight
p20221
aVhave nothing to do with flowers  but if you do those things flowers will happen because it's a consequence right now because
p20222
aVwe have gotten into this madness of being a goal oriented society  we are interested in the flower
p20223
aVwe are not interested in the plant
p20224
aVthis is the fundamental that the yoga will change within you you understand that you have to handle the process
p20225
aVright for a consequence to happen so in yoga there is a saying
p20226
aVthat if you're goal oriented your one eye will be on the goal that
p20227
aVmeans you will find your way only with one eye
p20228
aVwhich is an inefficient way of doing things if you use both your eyes to find your way it's much more efficient  so
p20229
aVwhy is a guru needed it can be done without it
p20230
aVi'm asking you a simple question
p20231
aVeven to learn abc the alphabet you needed a teacher
p20232
aVbut you could have learnt it by yourself
p20233
aVmaybe you don't take in a lifetime  but the teacher taught it to you in a month or two  that's a big difference
p20234
aVso like somebody was talking to me and they asked what is this guru about i said this is the gps a
p20235
aVliving gps a guru positioning system  you know
p20236
aVif you want to find your way  it's best in uncharted terrain
p20237
aVunknown terrain
p20238
aVit's best to walk with somebody who's already done the terrain once or many times
p20239
aVotherwise simple things will become very complex
p20240
aVmy pleasure to recognize
p20241
aVmiss denise quatro
p20242
aVwho is the chair of the international yoga day committee at the united nations and an executive board member of the united nations 
p20243
aVstop recreation council enlightenment society denise you have the floor the international day of yoga committee at the un
p20244
aVcame into existence last year in the summer after the first international day of yoga
p20245
aVsri  chinmoy years ago his vision was to have peace meditations with the staff and he started the yoga club which
p20246
aVgerman is the president of how do you see the un system 
p20247
aVmeaning the secretarial staff who work here the diplomats from the different countries
p20248
aVbusiness and the ngos civil society who tried to implement the sdgs
p20249
aVhow do you see yoga bringing us all together  thank you so much
p20250
aVthis is being said again and again about peace so we need to look at this
p20251
aVwhen we say peace or mental peace as people are talking about it 
p20252
aVtoday even so called spiritual leaders are talking about peace being the highest goal in one's life  but
p20253
aVi would like to ask you please look at your life  and see if you want to enjoy your dinner tonight
p20254
aVeven if you are not ecstatic at least you must be peaceful
p20255
aVto enjoy your dinner if
p20256
aVyou want to enjoy the people around you at least you must be peaceful and happy if you want to enjoy a walk on the
p20257
aVstreet you must be peaceful and happy otherwise  it's not possible
p20258
aVso what is very fundamental to a fundamental requirement in our life 
p20259
aVunfortunately  we are pushing it as an ultimate goal of our life to be peaceful is not the highest thing it is the most basic
p20260
aVrequirement if a human being cannot even be peaceful there is really nothing that they can do
p20261
aVthis means that you're not even able to harness
p20262
aVyour body and mind the way you should
p20263
aVto look at it from one perspective
p20264
aVall human experience has a chemical basis to it what you call as peace is a certain kind of chemistry
p20265
aVwhat you call as joy is another kind of chemistry
p20266
aVblissfulness another ecstasy another agony and the kind
p20267
aVanxiety fear tests rest tension  whatever  you call it every human experience
p20268
aVhas a chemical basis to it
p20269
aVwe have not been thought about how to deal with this when i say how to deal with this as is as a
p20270
aVtechnology if you want to look at this as a machine
p20271
aVthis is the most sophisticated piece of technology on the planet the question is
p20272
aVto deal with this high level of technology have you read even the user's manual that's a question
p20273
aVyoga means it is the users manual of how to conduct this one
p20274
aVi would say when you ask this question how to bring all these diverse people together in this organization
p20275
aVit's best to start with the simplest process
p20276
aVwhich does not even need a specific allotment of time 
p20277
aVthis is where opa yoga will become useful people can sit in their work
p20278
aVspaces and right there they can do it three minutes
p20279
aVanytime they feel like it  he does not need a specific condition
p20280
aVhe does not need a specific time if they see the benefit which they definitely will in a matter of two weeks time
p20281
aVthey will see a distinct benefit doing it wherever they are it does not need any kind of specific discipline or time or
p20282
aVother conditions required for normal
p20283
aVproper yoga to be done  i think this would be a good way to integrate them because
p20284
aVthis predates all religion  this is not about you versus me
p20285
aVthis is why i said this is not indian because a science cannot be indian yes it originated from india as
p20286
aVindians we are proud of it
p20287
aVbut it does not belong to india the very fact that united nations has declared an international yoga day me
p20288
aVindia has gifted it to the world it does not belong to india anymore  we
p20289
aVit's it's not something that we have to possess and identify with
p20290
aVthe significant aspect of my personal work has been
p20291
aVto remove all the frills of culture that yoga had acquired through this  millennia of transmission
p20292
aVslowly whatever you do in a particular culture it will acquire cultural frills
p20293
aVso one thing is to take off all the cultural frills and present it as an absolute science and the technology for well being
p20294
aVthis is an important thing in an organization like this where there are people from every nation
p20295
aVthere are people from every kind of denominations every kind of faith every kind of beliefs every kind of ideologies
p20296
aVit's very very important that yoga is brought as a proper science
p20297
aVnot as a cultural thing not as an indian thing  it's very important to do that

aS'that is not happening because we have not at rest in a nature so when it when you address it in a scientific manner'
p20420
aS'rather than by belief by philosophy by '
p20421
aS'is you address human well being in a scientific way this is yoga'

p20427
aS'what you call as myself is just a pop up on this planet and it ll pop out'

p20433
aS'the fundamental for this came from this'
p20434
aS'this happened to me when i was in the university'
p20435
aS'simply about eight years ago when i when i happened to in my home town'
p20436
aS'a very long time one of my english teachers came up to me and said now '
p20437
aS'understand why you would not let me teach robert frost i said lamp'

aS'and deep i said stop'

p20444
aS'a '
p20445
aS"she had no a is a very glad for it i said i don't care how great he is he calls tree a wood"
p20446
aS'dormordelizendtohim'
p20447
aS'then when we wanted to start this is'
p20448
aS's in a sadthenindiawhenwe found that we were worgoinggryandekgaundowaderwas sinking whererelapedl'
p20449
aS'when i decided we will plant hundred and fourteen million trees in time '
p20450
aS'the simple thing that we did was i took thousands of people made them sit in the trees'
p20451
aS'and we set up a yogidprucsess with which they experienced that what they re breathing '
p20452
aS'the treated inhaling what the trees are ceiling there inhaling and they realized one home of the lungs is hanging out there'
p20453
aS'once they realize this there is no stopping'
p20454
aS'and today millions of trees are being planted on a all basis all done by common people'
p20455
aS'simply because of a brought this yogic experience to them that they truly'
p20456
aS'is that one half of the reading apperaesis actually out there not here'
p20457
aS'so bringing this experience into people that what you think as myself is'
p20458
aS'within the boundaries of your physical nature it goes well beyond that if this becomes a living reality'
p20459
aS'then fulfilling these goals that united nations has for the world '
p20460
aS'becomes much more possible than the way it is right now where we are trying to push in one way'
p20461
aS"but a whole lot of people are pushing in opposite direction because they don't even see as the "
p20462
aS'he is a girl i i want it to'
p20463
aS'point out this incredible thing about the tree planting project is that sud guru '
p20464
aS'ted that the trees be planted on small plots of land less than half an acre'
p20465
aS'half of the trees are fruit trees'
p20466
aS'and then half of them can be used for firewood so that the people who live on these lands are '
p20467
aS'from them they take care of the trees and those trees actually really grow'
p20468
aS"one of the things that that's really working on is is poverty"
p20469
aS'when i look at the world today and i see'
p20470
aS'especially in the united states this'
p20471
aS"a gap between people who have capital and people who don't"
p20472
aS"i it's a it said very disturbing sign to me a that this the gap between rich and poor"
p20473
aS'can you talk a little bit about how yoga would address that in terms of sustainable develop'
p20474
aS'we must understand this that we have chosen it cannot an economic model which is all about everybody for himself for her '
p20475
aS'there is no larger commitment to humanity as such because that is market economy'

aS'he so '

p20481
aS'so unfortunately fail notnessiily because theyre bad because human beings are not ready for that the '
p20482
aS'that is'
p20483
aS'poor people who had nothing wanted to share the rich never wanted to share '
p20484
aS'so it became a joke in the world if we lit had to if rich had the consciousness to share'
p20485
aS'is a bit of in a great idea'
p20486
aS"but the poor want to share rich don't want to share so that is the same situation here"
p20487
aS'and this is the same situation building up everywhere else in the world'
p20488
aS'he is the best way to run the world no but do we have a better '
p20489
aS'so because right now we are in that place so the only thing that we can truly do '
p20490
aS'that we bring what is this what we are leftning to as yoga as a living expert'
p20491
aS'it does not reinteistingyourbody'
p20492
aS'yoga does not mean standing on your head yoga does not mean holding your breath'
p20493
aS'means in some way you have transcended the limitations of your physical nature you are beginning to experience life '
p20494
aS'a possibility not just this physical form that you are once this becomes a living expert'
p20495
aS'sharing and living together will become a common experience everywhere'
p20496

aS"whatever you are manafactering or whatever you're selling or whatever the business sees"
p20508
aS'whether you are selling a safety pin or a computer or a fish '

aS'to let the business is about him and love '

p20520
aS'there in just'
p20521
aS'in the last media so '
p20522
aS'only focused on the business leaders because'
p20523
aS'a time a few hundred years ago where the most inflenceiolleadeship on the planet was religiouslyteship'
p20524
aS'later on when the millidrymessines'
p20525
aS'built up in a big way the millitriledes dominated the world in the last hundred years'
p20526
aS'early elected leaders have become the most dominant force in the next fifteen to twenty five years'
p20527
aS'you will see the business leaders will be the most important or inflenciallidship on the planet'
p20528
aS'the good thing about business is that'
p20529
aS'man is willing to make a deal live the deal is good no matter who you are'
p20530
aS"i am saying the old pritidice of i cannot make a deal with somebody is going away and they're willing to make a deal"
p20531
aS'thing is sustainable only if it is beneficial to both the parties'
p20532
aS"nothing can be sustained either in the marketplace or in marriage unless it's beneficial aboard the parties"
p20533
aS"when it's truly beneficial to both the parties this can be sustained"
p20534
aS'this is slowly sinking into the business leadership i have seen in the last twendie'
p20535
aS'business leaders their way of thinking is very were different than what it was'
p20536
aS'my essential work has been to move individual leaders from their personal ambitions to a low evigion'
p20537
aS'because a large erisonmeans'
p20538
aS'then the business is is '
p20539
aS"a for a long fitted of time if it's just your personal ambition the world will work against you if you have a low division"
p20540
aS'the world will work with you this is a big difference'
p20541
aS'so this is something that is slowly sinking and you will see if you see annual meetings of a man'
p20542
aS"is what they're talking if you look at the old economic forum if you look at weios economic "
p20543
aS'in my assemblies on the planet you will see that '
p20544
aS'in to talk about a law envision how to make a difference rather than how to make a profit'
p20545
aS'this is become the language of the business these days it still has to manifest in a big way'

aVwhen my longing came  i looked 
p21227
aVi met so many people  who claimed to be gurus

aVhow a guru should not be  
p21230
aVand that s not 
p21231
aVthat s not a small thing to learn 
p21232

aVi always tell my technician what not to do 
p21236
aVi never tell them what to do  
p21237
aV so  for a good student  there is no problem 
p21238
aVwherever he goes  he will learn 
p21239
aVwhatever he meets  he will learn 
p21240
aVa good guru is one 
p21241
aVwho doesn t teach you anything
p21242
aVbut makes you so thirsty  you can t help learning 
p21243
aVif people come to me thirsty  i don t give them water 
p21244
aVi put salt in their mouth  
p21245
aVthey get so thirsty  they got to find it 
p21246

p21247
aVwhich is not yet in their experience 
p21248
aVthe only choice that somebody has is
p21249
aVeither to believe what you say
p21250
aVor disbelieve what you say 
p21251
aVif you believe  you do not get any closer to reality 
p21252
aVif you disbelieve  you will not get any closer to reality 
p21253
aVit is just that if you believe me 
p21254
aVyou will have a positive story to tell 
p21255
aVif you disbelieve me 
p21256
aVyou will have a negative story to tell 
p21257
aVbut you will not be an inch closer to reality 
p21258
aVabove all  i think
p21259
aVputting people into this kind of a dilemma 
p21260
aVeither to believe or disbelieve whatever i say or do 
p21261
aVi think it s obscene 
p21262
aVyou should not put people into such a situation

p21264
aVyou are a seeker but not intense enough 
p21265
aVso  my work is to make you so intense
p21266
aVthat it cannot be denied to you

aVbecause truth is not hiding  you are hiding from it 
p21268
aVtruth is not hiding 
p21269
aVtruth is obvious everywhere in the universe 
p21270
aVyou are hiding from it because
p21271
aVthe intensity of seeking has not happened 
p21272
aVif seeking becomes intense enough 
p21273
aVknowing is not far away
p21274
aVbecause what you re seeking is not sitting on mount everest 
p21275
aVit s within you 
p21276
aVso how long does it take 
p21277
aVwhat is within you  if it takes a lifetime

aVyes or no

aVit was sitting on mount everest 
p21281
aVyou could not climb  that s understandable 
p21282
aVmaybe you don t have the legs and the lungs to get to the top of the mountain 
p21283
aVbut what is within you  if you don t find 
p21284
aVobviously you re on a con job or no 
p21285
aVso to get you out of this deception  is all my work is 
p21286
aVmy work is not to dispense truth

p21294
aV it s been a very long time since i saw one 
p21295

aVi think on the airline  i saw one 
p21297
aVthis is about something in the

aV that s a good movie  
p21302
aV yes  sir  
p21303
aVand manjhi copied his getup also  i think 
p21304
aV i think it was very well done 
p21305
ag21224
aVi think something like that 
p21306
aVand furthermore lighter  guru  
p21307
aVwhich is that screen heroine you fell in love in your  
p21308
aV i m sorry

aV   you fell in love in your younger age 
p21313
aV me  oh no 
p21314
aV now you love human being 
p21315
aV no 
p21316
aVthey were enough girls around in my town  
p21317
aVi didn t have to look to mumbai  
p21318
aV now let s come to his sphere now  please 
p21319
aVis that guruji has been talking very fondly about his chamundi hills 
p21320
aVand i m fortunate enough to have visited chamundi hills
p21321
aVand i shot one of my film called krodhi on chamundi hills 
p21322
aV oh really  
p21323
aV yes sir 
p21324
aVso  i m very fond of mysore locations and all of those 
p21325
aVi made pardes and all that 
p21326
aVso i remember i was making film called krodhi in 1978
p21327
aVand there was a scene i shot
p21328
aVbecause i thought that was the right location for this scene 
p21329
aVcan i explain you one minute the scene part of it 
p21330
aV mhmm  
p21331
aV it was a dharmendra and pran scene 
p21332
aVthat one criminal has entered into the team of saints in disguise 
p21333
aVthe guruji of that team accept him as 
p21334
aV there re lot of saints who don t need any help from outside  
p21335
aV so there was a scene
p21336
aVwhen the criminal asked guru 
p21337
aV don t teach me about this god and destiny  and all this 
p21338
aVi know it all  he said that 
p21339
aVi wrote the  i wrote dialogues 
p21340
aVhe says 
p21341
aV there must be a very smart and very shrewd guy 1000 years back 
p21342
aVwho created these two worlds called god
p21343
aVand the other world called fate 
p21344
aVhe created world god because he wanted his children to follow what he said 
p21345
aVwhat he wants them to believe 
p21346
aVso he made them a fear of god 
p21347
aVand fate he created the world
p21348
aVbecause when he child fails in following all the principles laid down by him 
p21349
aVhe says it is your destiny 
p21350
aVit is your bhagya  
p21351
aVso i know it all 
p21352
aVand this was a question he put it to guru 
p21353
aVand guru answered him that
p21354
aVthere was one shila in chamundi hill we created
p21355
aVand there was some writings on the stones 
p21356
aVhe says   look at it    referring to hindi phrase  
p21357
aVdevotion is nothing but a power 
p21358
aVgod is nothing but a man who is great 
p21359
aVlove is nothing but bliss that you and me have to find in one another 
p21360
aVyou have got a wisdom
p21361
aVbut there is a layer on you of the worldly pollution 
p21362
aVso you are a man of intellect
p21363
aVbut you do not realize the importance of it 
p21364
aVso this is why i remember chamundi hills 
p21365
aVbecause i wrote this scene there while sitting on the stone 
p21366
aV oh  hope not the same rock as me  
p21367
aV so i thought that is how you become sadhguru
p21368
aVbecause you belong to chamundi hill  
p21369
aVthank you  sir 
p21370
aVnow  my short questions in my mind since my childhood is 
p21371
aVwhat is the difference between a rich man and a wealthy man 
p21372
aVwho s really rich man 
p21373
aV ahh  one who has the new currency is a rich man  
p21374
aV so 
p21375
aVyou mean to say the man with the old currency has gone poor  
p21376
aVpoorer 
p21377
aV see  unfortunately  we have brought the world to a place  where
p21378
aVthe words like rich or wealth
p21379
aVhave become purely economic descriptions 
p21380
aVthere was a time when people would talk about wealth of knowledge or
p21381
aVwealth of wisdom 
p21382
aVthat s gone 
p21383
aVtoday  if you say wealthy 
p21384
aVpeople will only understand it as an economic wealth
p21385
aVbecause in many ways  today 
p21386
aVsociety is driven by economics 
p21387
aVthere was a time  when we were overly influenced by the british 
p21388
aVat least we would discuss the weather  
p21389
aVof course  mumbai weather 
p21390
aVthere s nothing much to discuss  
p21391
aVbut today 
p21392
aVall conversations are around economy 
p21393
aVeverywhere in the world 
p21394
aVeverybody is behaving like an economist these days
p21395
aVbecause it is the economic engine 
p21396
aVwhich is driving people s minds 
p21397
aVit is the economic engine 
p21398
aVwhich is determining the nature of choices that we make in the world 
p21399
aVit is the economic opportunities  which determine
p21400
aVwhat  what kind of education people go through 
p21401
aVpeople are not studying what they want to know 
p21402
aVpeople are studying that which will fetch them the maximum money 
p21403
ag21280
aV so  maybe a few are still marrying for love  
p21404
aVeverything has become economic 
p21405
aVin united states  a whole lot of people 
p21406
aVbefore marriage they re signing a contract
p21407
aVin case we divorce  what s the deal  
p21408
aVhow can two people become one when this calculation is on 
p21409
aVbut the  even the idea of becoming one has been given up 
p21410
aVit s always two 
p21411
aVthe idea and the dream of two people becoming one has been completely given up
p21412
aVbecause when economic calculation comes 
p21413
aVyou become exclusive 
p21414
aVyou can t be inclusive 
p21415
aVso economics are ruling us in every way 
p21416
aVso when you say richness 
p21417
aVwhen you say wealth 
p21418
aVwe re only talking about money 
p21419
aVnot just richness and wealth 
p21420
aVif you say   he s a big man in the town 
p21421
aVit doesn t mean that he has a big brain 
p21422
aVit doesn t mean that he has a big heart 
p21423
aVit means he has a big pocket 
p21424
aVnothing else 
p21425
aVthis is a very poor way to exist 
p21426
aVwhen we do this  
p21427
aVthe ladies must know this  
p21428
aVwhen economics become the main crux of everything that we do 
p21429
aVthe feminine will vanish from the world 
p21430
aVor feminine will be subjugated 
p21431
aVif women have to succeed 
p21432
aVthey have to become like men 
p21433
aVthere is no other way 
p21434
aVmasculine will be everything 
p21435
aVthat means world will become utilitarian 
p21436
aVthere ll be no aesthetic 
p21437
aVthere ll be no beauty 
p21438
aVthere ll be no gentleness 
p21439
aVeverything will be a calculation  
p21440
aVwhat is useful 
p21441
aVwhat is not useful 
p21442
aVwhat do i get 
p21443
aVwhat do you get 
p21444
aVthere will be no home 
p21445
aVthere will be only a marketplace everywhere 
p21446
aVin the marketplace 
p21447
aVthe rules of the marketplace are like this  
p21448
aVif i give less and take more  that means i m smart 
p21449
ag21280
aVif you buy 
p21450
aVyou go to the share market  you buy for less and sell it for more 
p21451
aVthat is smart 
p21452
aVbut life doesn t work like that 
p21453
aVlife becomes beautiful
p21454
aVonly when you re willing to give it all
p21455
aVand you don t care what you get  
p21456
aVunfortunately  economics means
p21457
aVan organized approach to survival 
p21458
aVnow  we ve made survival 
p21459
aVwhen we were in the caves  survival was a big issue 
p21460
aVwe organized civilization with so much effort
p21461
aVbecause we thought we could leave survival behind
p21462
aVand focus on higher dimensions of life 
p21463
aVbut once again  we have brought ourselves to a place 
p21464
aVor bringing ourselves to a place 
p21465
aVwhere survival is supreme 
p21466
aVnothing else matters now 
p21467
aVonly thing is
p21468
aVwe ve raised the bar of survival in such a way
p21469
aVthat it doesn t matter what you have 
p21470
aVyou re still trying to survive 
p21471
aVaffluent nations in the world 
p21472
aVthe western countries  where
p21473
aValmost every citizen has everything that is needed 
p21474
aVthey re still fighting for survival  
p21475
aVfighting for survival like nobody else  
p21476
aVi keep asking the american people 
p21477
aV you guys  all the time talking about freedom 
p21478
aVwhere is freedom in your life 
p21479
aVbecause even if the most significant dimension appears in your life 
p21480
aVyou can t take a turn 
p21481
aVi keep joking with them  
p21482
aV you know  some time ago  2000 years ago 
p21483
aVjesus came and said   come  follow me 
p21484
aVa few people followed him 
p21485
ag21392
aVif your jesus comes back and says   come follow me 
p21486
aVwhere can you follow him 
p21487
aVyou have a thirty five year mortgage on your house  
p21488
aVyou have still a student loan at the age of forty five 
p21489
aVyou have a car loan  you have insurance 
p21490
aVyou have this 
p21491
aVyou re not going to follow 
p21492
aVyou got a bank to go to  
p21493
aVyou re not going to follow anything 
p21494
aVit doesn t matter even if a divine entity arrives 
p21495
aVyou cannot change the direction of your life 
p21496
aVthis is not freedom 
p21497
aVfreedom means you should be able to change and alter your life
p21498
aVaccording to the opportunities that come  isn t it 
p21499
aVif something truly significant comes 
p21500
aVyou should be able to turn around and do something else 
p21501
aVbecause we have enshrined economics as the highest value 
p21502
aVall these things are gone 
p21503
aVeverything is about money 
p21504
aVand wealth means just money again 
p21505
aVmost of the wealth that we have today in the world
p21506
aVis just made up in people s minds 
p21507
aVin 2008 
p21508
aVwhen recession was setting in the western countries 
p21509
aVi happened to be at davos at the economic forum 
p21510
aVat that year 
p21511
aVindia was running a campaign in switzerland 
p21512
aVthe campaign was
p21513
aV india everywhere 
p21514
aVall the american and european business leaders were all looking very depressed because
p21515
aVrecession was coming 
p21516
aVthat means they had a few billion dollars less than what they had 
p21517
aVand they were all very depressed
p21518
aVso depressed means you
p21519
aVvery touchy and angry with everything 
p21520
aVindian people were rubbing it in their face  
p21521
aVi get down in switzerland 
p21522
aVhuge hoardings  india everywhere 
p21523
aVon the buses   india everywhere 
p21524
aVinside the train   india everywhere 
p21525
aVso it was irritating everybody  
p21526
aVso they asked me to handle a session called 
p21527
aVrecession and depression  
p21528
aVi said   recession is bad enough 
p21529
aVdepression is worse 
p21530
aVall of you have always been complaining you don t have enough free time 
p21531
aVthis is the time to walk on the beach  
p21532
aVwhat are you complaining about 
p21533
aVwhat is it that we re complaining about 
p21534
aVso  there was a chinese bureaucrat 
p21535
aVsee  the way we have structured the economic engine is such 
p21536
aVit is like that panchatantra story 
p21537
aVwhere a monkey is sitting on the wrong end of the branch
p21538
aVand chopping the branch 
p21539
aVif it succeeds  it will fall 
p21540
aVthat s how we are right now 
p21541
aVso  i said 
p21542
aV see  the way you have s  structured this is
p21543
aVif we succeed  we shall fail 
p21544
aVthat s how we are right now because
p21545
aVif you fail  you will be depressed 
p21546
aVif we succeed  the world will be damned 
p21547
aVyes 
p21548
aVthe way we re going 
p21549
aVso i said 
p21550
aV it s better you re depressed
p21551
aVbecause  if your ambitions are fulfilled 
p21552
aVthere ll be no planet left 
p21553
aVthat s where we re going 
p21554
aVso this chinese bureaucrat did a wonderful thing 
p21555
aVhe 
p21556
aVthere was a big mirror 
p21557
aVhe put one chair and he said 
p21558
aV see  there are two chairs  
p21559
aVone chair here  one chair in the mirror 
p21560
aVthey all said yes 
p21561
aVthen he covered up the mirror and he said 
p21562
aV see  now there s only one chair 
p21563
aVthey said yes 
p21564
aVthen he said 
p21565
aV always there was only one chair  
p21566
aVyou made it up with a mirror that there are two chairs 
p21567
aVthe wealth on the planet is not gone anywhere 
p21568
aVit is just distributing itself a little bit 
p21569
aVevery time it slips out of your hands
p21570
aVand goes to somebody  you will get depressed 
p21571
aVhe was saying it s moving to china  
p21572
aV thank you  thank you 
p21573
aVthank you for sharing the chair also with us  
p21574
aV here  there are two  
p21575
aV two chairs 
p21576
aVthank you very much for saving two chairs 
p21577
aVnow  the other question comes in my mind  sir 
p21578
aVabout the education to children 
p21579
aVthere is a slogan going on in our country  
p21580
aVright to educate 
p21581
aVright to education 
p21582
aVand i always feel that more than right to education 
p21583
aVthere has to be a right kind of education 
p21584
aVbecause educating c a t cat is a bat 
p21585
aVit s not a right education 
p21586
aVright kind of educations is more important 
p21587
aVthat s what i feel and i say 
p21588
aVwhere do we lack
p21589
aVthe whole process of education for the so many years 
p21590
aVsee  rather century or eighty years
p21591
aVthat we have not been living with the intellectual power till now 
p21592
aVwe face that 
p21593
aVi say india is not intellect 
p21594
aVis economically poor 
p21595
aVindia is intellectually poor at the moment
p21596
aVbecause there has been a big gap of the whole process of education 
p21597
aVthe right kind of educations to all of our children 
p21598
aVwhat is your take on it  sadhguru 
p21599
aV see  india is not  definitely not poor on intellect 
p21600
aVi would say 
p21601
aV you are one 
p21602
aVwe are thousands 
p21603
aV no  
p21604
aVi speak to all kinds of people around the world  
p21605
aVbusiness leaders 
p21606
aVacademics 
p21607
aVscientists 
p21608
aVbut still i would say 
p21609
aV when i say  it means ignorance 
p21610
aV no  at random 
p21611
aVif you pick up hundred people from the street just like that 
p21612
aVeither in mumbai
p21613
aVor chennai
p21614
aVor bangalore 
p21615
aVi would say they are way smarter than
p21616
aVmost people that you can pick up anywhere in the world  
p21617
aVonly 
p21618
aVhey  you shouldn t clap for yourself like this  
p21619
aVi should have left out mumbai  
p21620
aVit is just that we do not have an organization
p21621
aVfor this intellect to find expression 
p21622
aVbecause there is no necessary structures to find expression 
p21623
aVeach person operates 
p21624
aVthis is one thing about india 
p21625
aVeverybody thinks he s a genius  
p21626
aV that s our education  
p21627
aV and you will see 
p21628
aVeverybody is an expert on everything 
p21629
aVit s like 
p21630
aVif you go to a local tea shop 
p21631
aVhe will tell you how virat kohli s strokes are not perfect  
p21632
aVhow he should do like this  like that 
p21633
aVhe will say how narendra modi does not know
p21634
aVhow to be a prime minister  
p21635
aVwhat he should do 
p21636
aV we face every time 
p21637
aVa paanwala tells me how to make a story  
p21638
aV he knows everything in the world
p21639
aVbut it s just that he can t make good tea  
p21640
aVit s just one little lacuna 
p21641
aVotherwise everything else he s an expert  
p21642
aVwe have this as a little bit of an issue in the country 
p21643
aVthis is mainly because there is no outlet 
p21644
aVfor this enormous intellect that country has 
p21645
aVthere is no structures for people to find expression to that 
p21646
aVyou just see
p21647
aVtake indian people and put them anywhere 
p21648
aVthey re just on the tops 
p21649
aV survivors 
p21650
aV it s not about surviving  they re thriving 
p21651
aVbecause once they find proper structures and they understand the structure 
p21652
aVyou can t stop them
p21653
aVbecause there is a necessary intellect 
p21654
aVthis is a consequence of a very huge history 
p21655
aVa cultural history that we have 
p21656
aVtoday  there are experiments to show 
p21657
aVlike for example if you 
p21658
aVlet us say you put the smell of this flower on some food substance
p21659
aVand keep it in front of a rat
p21660
aVor a mouse
p21661
aVand when it goes and touches it 
p21662
aVit ll get an electric shock 
p21663
aVif you do this a few times 
p21664
aVnext seven generations 
p21665
aVthose rats will not go towards that smell 
p21666
aVall of them understand 
p21667
aVthis is their learning 
p21668
aVso similarly  within the human being 
p21669
aVa lot that was done in the past 
p21670
aVwhich is  which we call as samskara 
p21671
aVthat means intrinsic learning that we have 
p21672
aVis still paying off 
p21673
aVor in other words  we still surviving on old food 
p21674
aVit is time that this generation gets the right stuff 
p21675
aVbut that s not happened yet
p21676
aVbecause our education systems
p21677
aVand every system that we had
p21678
aVhas been disrupted badly in a systematic way
p21679
aVbecause we ve been an occupied nation for nearly a 1000 years 
p21680
aVsome came and just ravaged everything 
p21681
aVothers came and systematically destroyed everything 
p21682
aVand they created an education system 
p21683
aVwhich was mainly towards obedience
p21684
aVand clerical kind of work to serve
p21685
aVher majesty s service 
p21686
aVin 1947  when we got our independence 
p21687
aVwe should have seriously thought about
p21688
aVwhat kind of education does india need 
p21689
aVwe must understand this  
p21690
aVwithout any infrastructure 
p21691
aVliterally without infrastructure 
p21692
aVwithout any kind of education 
p21693
aVour farmers are producing food for 1 25 billion people  
p21694
aVthis is knowledge 
p21695
aVwhy is this not knowledge  i m asking 
p21696
aVwhy is this not knowledge 
p21697
aVwhy is this not competence  i 
p21698
aVi was talking to a group of ceos 
p21699
aVi was just telling them 
p21700
aV see  i ll give you ten acres of very fertile land 
p21701
aVyou do one thing 
p21702
aVi ll give you a couple of two different crops 
p21703
aVyou take out the harvest  let me see 
p21704
aVall of you are mba  mba  whatever 
p21705
aVyou take out a crop  let me see 
p21706
aVit ll freak the hell out of you  i m telling you 
p21707
aVit s not easy 
p21708
aVi ve personally farmed  i know what it takes 
p21709
aVit is 
p21710
aVthe more educated you are  the more difficult it becomes   
p21711
aVreally
p21712
aVbecause it takes a very  a very  a close sense of involvement
p21713
aVwith what you re doing 
p21714
aVand from this 
p21715
aVfrom ploughing the land to the seed to taking the crop out 
p21716
aVit is not a easy process 
p21717
aVbut our farmers are just doing it like that
p21718
aVas if it s just part of their life 
p21719
aVsomething that they just inherited 
p21720
aVthis is a nation with over 12 000 years of agricultural history 
p21721
aVthe only land like that on the planet 
p21722
aVin southern india 
p21723
aVthey re farming the same land for over 12 000 years 
p21724
aVthere are certain records  which show this 
p21725
aVso  there is knowledge like this on various levels 
p21726
aVbut we have tried to push everything aside
p21727
aVand reinvent the wheel 
p21728
aVonce again  we want to learn abc
p21729
aVand do it like this 
p21730
aVso  there is a disruption in the intrinsic learning that we have
p21731
aVand the school learning that is coming to us 
p21732
aVi m saying  just read a book 
p21733
aVhowever educated you may be 
p21734
aVread a book and make one good sambar  let me see  
p21735
aVit won t come 
p21736
aV yeah  that s exactly question is  yeah 
p21737
aV because we are thinking only what is written in the book 
p21738
aVa   b   c is only knowledge 
p21739
aVwhy is not making a wonderful sambar knowledge 
p21740
aVwhy is not growing a crop knowledge 
p21741
aVwhy is not making a pot knowledge 
p21742
aVwe have very constipated sense of what is knowledge 
p21743
aVbecause 
p21744
aV the school system 
p21745
aV  because this has come from elsewhere 
p21746
aVsome indian student in oxford  
p21747
aVi was just 
p21748
aVnot even a month 
p21749
aVthree weeks ago i was speaking at the oxford union in oxford university  
p21750
aVone of the indian students has filed a court petition
p21751
aVthat he should be compensated for the boring classes
p21752
aVthat they re teaching in oxford university  
p21753
aVi was very happy  
p21754
aVthat s why i never went  
p21755
aVthat s why i never went to the university  
p21756
aV that amazes me 
p21757
aVthat is why the school system  the textbook 
p21758
aVthe six answers to the exam 
p21759
aVsix questions in the exam 
p21760
aVafter studying whole year 
p21761
aVit really amazes me 
p21762
aVthat is why i always feel 
p21763
aVwhat not the internal enlightenment to the children 
p21764
aV see  the problem is 
p21765
aVwhy we re talking about right to education is 
p21766
aVwe have 
p21767
aVfor example   i don t know the exact number all over the country  
p21768
aVin tamil nadu itself 
p21769
aVwe have 9 6 million children in the government schools alone  okay 
p21770
aV9 6 million children 
p21771
aVwhen you have such vast numbers 
p21772
aVthen you have to do something 
p21773
aVwhat you do for the mass is never the best 
p21774
aVbut what to do 
p21775
aVyou have to include everybody 
p21776
aVso  some rudimentary sense of education is happening
p21777
aVbecause at least they must learn to 
p21778
aVif you don t know this 
p21779
aVseventies and eighties  the objective was 
p21780
aVeverybody should know how to write their name 
p21781
aVa campaign was 
p21782
aVliteracy means you must know how to write your name 
p21783
aVthis is all 
p21784
aVthat is  they were trying to move them
p21785
aVfrom thumb imprint to something written 
p21786
aVit did not change life in any way
p21787
aVbut it was a forward movement in a sense 
p21788
aVbut we must know this 
p21789
aVwhen the british came  around two hundred and seventy to three hundred years ago 
p21790
aVthere was not a single illiterate person in this country 
p21791
aVthey were amazed because
p21792
aVthere were no schoolrooms anywhere 
p21793
aVthere was no school infrastructure
p21794
aVbut there was no illiterate 
p21795
aVeverybody could read and write 
p21796
aV vidhwan  everybody was vidhwan 
p21797
aV so they wondered  how does this happen 
p21798
aVthen they realized the system is so organic
p21799
aVthat it is simply happening from within 
p21800
aVso the first thing they decided was 
p21801
aV we must destroy this education system
p21802
aVbecause if you educate them like this 
p21803
aVthey will never become english 
p21804
aVsee  i m the only indian left in this hall  
p21805
aVso  this system of education that we have inherited
p21806
aVfrom those who occupied this nation 
p21807
aVsee  we must understand this  
p21808
aVyou never take advice from your enemy  isn t it 
p21809
aVif you have some sense  i m saying  
p21810
aVso   when they leave your country and go 
p21811
aVfirst things to overhaul is your political system 
p21812
aVyour education system 
p21813
aVyour administrative system 
p21814
aVthese are things must be overhauled immediately
p21815
aVbecause they were created for a certain purpose 
p21816
aVfor example  even today   the terminology we re using  i m saying  
p21817
aVthe district administrators in many states including tamil nadu are referred to as collectors 
p21818
aVin the british time  they were just tax collectors 
p21819
aVtheir only administration was to collect tax
p21820
aVand take it back home 
p21821
aVeven today  our administrators are called collectors 
p21822
aVwhat are they supposed to collect from us  
p21823
aVi m saying we didn t change anything 
p21824
aVwe  we were just lazy 
p21825
aVwe were just happy that we ve become free 
p21826
aVbut freedom is a terrible thing 
p21827
aVif you do not understand the responsibility of being free 
p21828
aVfreedom is a terrible thing 
p21829
aVif somebody is managing our life  it is better 
p21830
aVwhen we are not responsible 
p21831
aVonly if we re truly responsible  freedom is a wonderful thing 
p21832
aVotherwise  freedom is a terrible thing  
p21833
aV maturity 
p21834
aVfreedom must come with the maturity  that s true  guruji 
p21835
aVi belong to middle class  brought up by middle class family 
p21836
aVand most of us are middle class people 
p21837
aVwhat is this middle class  
p21838
aVi m doing well 
p21839
aVi m educated 
p21840
aVi m graduate 
p21841
aVstill they call me   you re middle class   
p21842
aVand we  most of us run the country 
p21843
aV see  this is an aspirational thing 
p21844
aVwhen large segments of the country were in extreme poverty 
p21845
aVthe aspiration was to become middle class 
p21846
aVmiddle class means you have college education 
p21847
aVyou may not be very rich 
p21848
aVbut you re college educated  you have a job and 
p21849
aVyou have a regular job 
p21850
aVusually  government employees were middle class at one time 
p21851
aVslowly  others joined up 
p21852
aVnow middle class people are driving mercedes benz   okay 
p21853
aV is it in the terms of the economic development 
p21854
aVor the knowledge or the enlightenment 
p21855
aVwhat is  
p21856
aVin which term they are middle class 
p21857
aV oh  it was definitely an economic description 
p21858
aVand there was a big goof up with this middle class 
p21859
aVi think it was in nineties 
p21860
aVa certain us firm came  which was 
p21861
aVi forget the name of the firm 
p21862
aVthey came to do a market survey for ford motor company 
p21863
aVand they came here and they said some hundred million 
p21864
aVtwo hundred million whatever number of middle class families in india 
p21865
aVso ford can go to india 
p21866
aVno problem
p21867
aVbecause it has the largest middle class 
p21868
aVso  ford came and set up the plant at that time 
p21869
aVand they couldn t sell ten cars  
p21870
aVthen they found out 
p21871
aVa middle class in india is earning 10 000 rupees a month
p21872
aVand he can only cycle to his office 
p21873
aVno question of he buying a car 
p21874
aVit took them a while to understand 
p21875
aVeverybody have their own idea of middle class  
p21876
aVthey thought middle class means
p21877
aVin america  middle class means somebody who s earning
p21878
aVsomewhere between 60 000  i mean  30 000 dollars to 100 000 dollars is middle class 
p21879
aVhere  at that time 
p21880
aVindia s middle class is 
p21881
aVif they earn approximately 10 15 000 rupees per month 
p21882
aVthey were middle class  which is just three hundred dollars 
p21883
aVso  
p21884
aVeverybody has their own idea of middle class 
p21885
aVbut we can take this to another place 
p21886
aVnow you are claiming you re middle class  
p21887
aV because it always  i wonder 
p21888
aVmiddle class means naa idhar ke  na udhar ke 
p21889
aVneither this side nor that side 
p21890
aVneither i ve an identity  whether it s poor or rich 
p21891
aVthey are clear about themselves 
p21892
aVi am poor guy  he is clear
p21893
aVi m a rich guy 
p21894
aVthe middle class is neither this way nor that way  in what terms 
p21895
aVthat was bothering me but you answered 
p21896
aV aspiring to be rich but haven t made it  
p21897
aV you look at it like that
p21898
aVi a m taking all the  this golden opportunity to ask you  
p21899
aVthe question which bothers me at times
p21900
aVis about the world called democracy 
p21901
aVwhat is democracy
p21902
aVand what should be the relationship between the leaders and the people 
p21903
aVthe government and the people 
p21904
aVand in growing democracy 
p21905
aVwho gets corrupt first 
p21906
aVthe leader or the people 
p21907
aVthat s my question  
p21908
aV see  the  in tamil  the word for democracy is jananayakam 
p21909
aVthat means people are the leaders 
p21910
aV by the people  for the people  of the people 
p21911
aV that means there is no leader and there are no people 
p21912
aVpeople are the leaders 
p21913
aVthat s what democracy means 
p21914
aVunfortunately  people have forgotten that they are the leaders 
p21915
aVi hear 
p21916
aVeven today morning or yesterday an  evening  i was being interviewed 
p21917
aVtoday morning  i was being interviewed by a journalist in lucknow 
p21918
aVso  he said 
p21919
aV these politicians 
p21920
aVi said   there are no politicians 
p21921
aVthey didn t fall from the sky 
p21922
aVthey re just you and me 
p21923
aVsomebody who s willing to do the dirty job for you 
p21924
aVwhat you think is dirty and you don t want you yourself or your children to get into 
p21925
aVsomebody got into it for you 
p21926
aVyes  
p21927
aVand once you get there 
p21928
aVthe entire game is such that it just dirties your hands  you can t help it 
p21929
aVit s become like that  the system 
p21930
aVso in democracy  there is no leader and people 
p21931
aVit s people and people 
p21932
aV but obviously  there are leaders and there are people today 
p21933
aV that is because we have allowed it 
p21934
aVotherwise  every five years  you could stand up and become a leader 
p21935
aVthat s how it should be 
p21936
aVwe have not kept it mobile enough because
p21937
aVwe have this tendency of
p21938
aVgiving responsibility to somebody and forget about it 
p21939
aV and forget it for five years 
p21940
aV only when something goes wrong  we will scream 
p21941
aVotherwise  we don t care a damn  
p21942
aVno  if you 
p21943
aV when it is essential
p21944
aV if you re making a movie
p21945
aVor somebody is running a business 
p21946
aVnot after something goes wrong you ll attend to it as a director 
p21947
aVyou are on it every moment to see it goes right 
p21948
aV yes  sir 
p21949
aV so  i am saying 
p21950
aVonce you live in a democracy 
p21951
aVyou must be an active participant 
p21952
aVit is not a spectator sport  to sit back and forget about it
p21953
aVand then cry when something goes wrong 
p21954
aVi m telling you  even your home will not run right
p21955
aVif you don t pay enough attention 
p21956
aVforget about the nation 
p21957
ag21280
aVeven your home 
p21958
aVyour own family will become corrupt
p21959
aVif you re not paying attention to many things 
p21960
ag21280
ag21224
aV you don t like it but it s true  isn t it 
p21961
aVif you don t pay  constant attention 
p21962
aVeven your home will go bad and corrupt 
p21963
aVso  when this is the thing 
p21964
aVsuch a large nation 
p21965
aVif everybody doesn t pay attention to what needs to happen  it will go bad 
p21966
aVthen we cry 
p21967
aVwe have this problem  
p21968
aVwhen small things go wrong  we have somebody here 
p21969
aVwhen big things go wrong  we have somebody there  
p21970
aVthis guy  
p21971
aV is free  free  
p21972
aV he is never responsible for anything  
p21973
aVthis has to change  
p21974
aV yes  but we  i
p21975
aV see  the most beautiful thing about democracy is
p21976
aVpower can change hands without blood flowing 
p21977
aVnever before it s happened in human history 
p21978
aVwhenever power changes  blood will flow 
p21979
aVnow  power can shift from one group of people
p21980
aVto another group
p21981
aVwithout blood spilling 
p21982
aVwhich is a huge achievement  
p21983
aV but we as individual need to understand that
p21984
aVi am the part of the democracy
p21985
aVand i m equally responsible as my leaders are 
p21986
aV see  i think one mistake we have done is 
p21987
aVin our education systems  in our homes 
p21988
aVthere is no awareness about this 
p21989
aVthat there are instruments in a democratic process through which
p21990
aVall of us can participate in some way   on a daily basis  if we wish 
p21991
aVthis has  this awareness has not been brought to people 
p21992
aVthey think if they cast vote once in ten years 
p21993
aVbecause one election they ll miss  you know  
p21994
aVthen the election day they went to goa  
p21995
aVone they will miss 
p21996
aVone they will vote and they think they are very responsible citizens
p21997
aVbecause they voted once in ten years 
p21998
aVthat s not how it works  you need an active participation 
p21999
aVthen only democracy will work the way it has to work 
p22000
aVright now  our idea of leadership is
p22001
aVif we find a good leader  we will start worshipping them 
p22002
aVa good leader does not need worship 
p22003
aVwhat a leader needs 
p22004
aVif somebody is 
p22005
aVa competent leader comes at the top  what he needs is 
p22006
aVhe needs many layers of leadership 
p22007
aVso that he will find traction to what he wishes to do 
p22008
aVbut you will see  if a good leader comes 
p22009
aVhe will spin on the spot because there is no traction down the line 
p22010
aVeither there are worshipping people or those who re busy with their own stuff 
p22011
aVso  we need to understand 
p22012
aVdemocracy means we have taken the nation into our hands 
p22013
aVwe need to make it happen 
p22014
aVsomebody will guide it 
p22015
aVsomebody will make policies 
p22016
aVsomebody will take some decisions 
p22017
aVbut the nation is run by the people 
p22018
aVif we don t get it  then we will always be just complaining 
p22019
aVwe will not have a great nation 
p22020
aVif we want a great nation 
p22021
aVwe have to stand up and take charge of this country 
p22022
aVtaking charge of the country does not mean
p22023
aVusurping power tomorrow morning 
p22024
aVno 
p22025
aVwhere we are  what roles we have to play 
p22026
aVwe should be doing our best 
p22027
aVpeople are always talking about politicians being corrupt 
p22028
aVbut i m asking you 
p22029
aVif there is no policeman on the street 
p22030
aVhow many people will stop at the red light 
p22031
aVi think about ten percent 
p22032
aVi m being generous  i know  
p22033
aVabout ten percent 
p22034
aVthe rest 
p22035
aVif you elect any one of them as a chief minister or the prime minister  what do you think they will do 
p22036
aVbecause they re law breakers anyway 
p22037
aVi see  you know  normally i land in coimbatore late in the night 
p22038
aVten o clock  eleven o clock  one o clock  whatever time 
p22039
aVand i m driving from the airport 
p22040
aVred light  i stop 
p22041
aVthere is one little tvs moped guy who s parked behind me 
p22042
aVkee kee he will do  
p22043
aVthen i don t go till the green light comes 
p22044
aVhe comes next to me and says like this   
p22045
aV what s wrong with you 
p22046
aVhe thinks i m a fool  all right 
p22047
aV exactly 
p22048
aVexactly 
p22049
aV   his thing is 
p22050
aV no policeman  what are you doing here 
p22051
aVgo 
p22052
aVso  if you make these people into 
p22053
aVif you put these people into positions of power  what 
p22054
aVpeople who re on positions of power are on spotlight 
p22055
aVso everything that they do is seen 
p22056
aVbut corruption is all pervading  isn t it 
p22057
aVwithin the house 
p22058
aVbetween a girl child and a boy 
p22059
aVthere is a distinction 
p22060
aVthis is corruption 
p22061
aVbetween a right hand and left hand 
p22062
aVone is superior   one is inferior  this is corruption 
p22063
aVso  corruption is not just up there taking money or whatever 
p22064
aVcorruption is on all levels  isn t it 
p22065
aVthere is no evenhandedness about life 
p22066
aVwe ve brought this to everything 
p22067
aVthis has to go means
p22068
aVspiritual process is needed 
p22069
aVif i can  share something
p22070
aVi think i must have shared already 
p22071
aVi ll leave it  
p22072
aV spiritual process is important 
p22073
aV because an inclusiveness is needed 
p22074
aVyou must transcend looking at things as superior and inferior 
p22075
aVone is higher  one is lower 
p22076
aVyou learn to look at everything 
p22077
aVthis is one thing that happened to me very early 
p22078
aVi realized i don t know anything 
p22079
aVso i started paying attention
p22080
aVto just about anything 
p22081
aVone thing i discovered with people around me was 
p22082
aVthey could pay attention
p22083
aVor they would pay attention
p22084
aVonly to those things that they thought is important 
p22085
aVrest of it 
p22086
aVthey learned to ignore 
p22087
aVi couldn t do this
p22088
aVbecause i couldn t decide what is important 
p22089
aVi found the ant crawling on my 
p22090
aVon the floor was far more important to me
p22091
aVby  than my father  who was asking me to do something at that moment 
p22092
aVi m saying  
p22093
aVyes  it was 
p22094
aVit is so for your child also  isn t it so 
p22095
aVyour child is looking at the ant 
p22096
aVis he not
p22097
aVdoes he not think the ant is more important than you at that moment  
p22098
aVyes  he does 
p22099
aVbecause it s more interesting than you  
p22100
aVit is  
p22101
aVit is the finest piece of mechanics that you can find on the planet 
p22102
aVif you could build an automobile like an ant 
p22103
aVwhoa 
p22104
aVit would just go anywhere  you know 
p22105
aVso  i got into this mode of paying attention to just about anything
p22106
aVbecause it never occurred to me something is more important 
p22107
aVsomething is less important 
p22108
aVmy father believed that he s a very  he s a disciplinarian  
p22109
aVtch  so he thought  
p22110
aVso evening  seven o clock to nine o clock in the evening 
p22111
aVme and my siblings must study something  textbook 
p22112
aVand he will be sitting there reading some magazine or newspaper 
p22113
aVso that we study 
p22114
aVi ve no issues about all that 
p22115
aVif i just open my book
p22116
aVi just open somewhere  
p22117
aVi never had the habit  
p22118
aVeven today  i don t have the habit  
p22119
aVi always open somewhere 
p22120
aVif i read one page 
p22121
aVi know the author s mind through and through 
p22122
aVso i don t read beyond that  
p22123
aVso i open somewhere and on the page  i find a small speck of something 
p22124
aVyou know 
p22125
aVsome flaw in the page 
p22126
aVif i just look at it 
p22127
aVit held my attention 
p22128
aVentire two hours  i was like this  
p22129
aVlooking at the spot 
p22130
aVi never read a single word 
p22131
aVnor did i look up anywhere 
p22132
aVi just got absorbed into this little spot 
p22133
aVthere was enough in that little spot to keep me engaged for two hours 
p22134
aVwhy i m saying this is 
p22135
aVthis is the biggest mistake we re making with life 
p22136
aVwe are setting this up in our children s minds  
p22137
aVthis is god 
p22138
aVthis is devil 
p22139
aVthis is superior 
p22140
aVthis is inferior 
p22141
aVthis is mine 
p22142
aVthis is not mine 
p22143
aVin this  you re causing corruption 
p22144
aVyou re bringing corruption to the infant
p22145
aVto recognize one thing as high 
p22146
aVone thing as low 
p22147
aVone thing as mine 
p22148
aVone thing as not mine 
p22149
aVhere  corruption has started 
p22150
aVif you make this child that you brought him up like this into a prime minister 
p22151
aVof course he will be corrupt 
p22152
aVwhatever  if you 
p22153
aVby getting into a position of responsibility and power 
p22154
aVit only gets magnified 
p22155
aVsomebody doesn t just get corrupt the moment they get there 
p22156
aVthey ve been corrupt all their life 
p22157
aVthey ve been trained in corruption by their parents
p22158
aVand their society 
p22159
aVnow  it got magnified because the opportunity is magnified 
p22160
aVso  corruption is not up there 
p22161
aVcorruption is everywhere 
p22162
aVif you are concerned about corruption 
p22163
aVjust sit at home
p22164
aVand see how many things are there in your life 
p22165
aVwhich you need to iron out 
p22166
ag21280
ag21224
aV if you don t take this out 
p22167
aVyou have no right to complain about corruption
p22168
aVbecause corruption is in your home 
p22169
aVcorruption is in your mind 
p22170
aVcorruption is all around you 
p22171
aVit is just that those who re in positions of power 
p22172
aVyou expect them to be clean 
p22173
aVi also do 
p22174
aVbut i don t believe that will happen
p22175
aVunless down the line also we aspire for that in our lives 
p22176
aVbecause the kind of people we are 
p22177
aVthat s the kind of leaders we elect  isn t it 
p22178
aVwe have some aspiration to change it
p22179
aVbut we are not determined to change it 
p22180
aVsomething that is negative 
p22181
aVsomething that is rotting in a society will not go away
p22182
aVunless we re determined to change it 
p22183
aVstrong determination to change it 
p22184
aVotherwise it will just go on 
p22185
aVrot is not something that you can simply get rid of
p22186
aVbecause rot spreads by itself 
p22187
aVit is cleanliness  which is 
p22188
aVwhich doesn t spread by itself 
p22189
aVyou have to do the cleaning 
p22190
aVbut rot spreads by itself 
p22191
aVso corruption spreads by itself 
p22192
aVif you want to bring cleanliness 
p22193
aVyou have to strive 
p22194
aVfirst of all  bringing it into your life 
p22195
aVotherwise it s not going to work 
p22196
aVwe ll only talk about it 
p22197
aV sadhguru  you re a master of knowledge and history  mythology  everything
p22198
aVand i feel that i m a child of ancient india 
p22199
aVand i know indian 1000 years back 
p22200
aVindian hundred years back
p22201
aVand indian today
p22202
aV 1000 years ago  this s how they looked  
p22203
aV not to the getup 
p22204
aVhow i have changed from 1000 to hundred to today
p22205
aVand why i have changed 
p22206
aVis it a better
p22207
aVor need to be better 
p22208
aV what is the change  you re asking 
p22209
ag21224
aVwhat s the change as an indian 
p22210
aVhow much we have changed 
p22211
aV when we talk about india 
p22212
aV1000 means we re talking about recent times 
p22213
aV ancient times 
p22214
aV recent 
p22215
aV recent  1000 years  yeah 
p22216
aVi say 4000 5000 years 
p22217
aV so  india as a culture exists for over 12 15 000 years 
p22218
aVat one time  we became a nation with enormous intellect 
p22219
aVenormous capabilities 
p22220
aVvery crucible of science  mathematics  astronomy 
p22221
aVthe greatest scientists in the world have acknowledged 
p22222
aVmodern science could not have taken a single step
p22223
aVwithout the mathematic that came from india 
p22224
aVso  there were tremendous minds that we evolved because
p22225
aVwe had what is called as samskriti 
p22226
aVtoday  we have isha samskriti school  which is on these lines 
p22227
aVsamskriti means  
p22228
aVsam means equanimous and exuberant 
p22229
aVkriti means way of doing it 
p22230
aVthat is  getting life to a place  where it is exuberant and equanimous 
p22231
aVif you keep your life exuberant and equanimous 
p22232
aVnow this life will be full fledged life 
p22233
aVthis is the aspiration of every life 
p22234
aVwhether it is an earthworm 
p22235
aVor a bird
p22236
aVor a tree 
p22237
aVall of them are aspiring to become full fledged life 
p22238
aVso  is a human being 
p22239
aVonly thing is we know what is a full fledged earthworm 
p22240
aVwe know what is a full fledged bird 
p22241
aVwe know what is a full fledged tree
p22242
aVbut we do not know what is a full fledged human being 
p22243
aVno matter what you become 
p22244
aVstill you feel it s not enough 
p22245
aVit doesn t matter what you have become 
p22246
aVin somebody else s eyes  you might have become big 
p22247
aVbut within you  you know this is not enough
p22248
aVbecause what is human is a limitless possibility 
p22249
aV expansion 
p22250
aV because for every other creature  nature has set two lines 
p22251
aVbetween these two lines  they live and die 
p22252
aVfor a human being  there is only bottom line 
p22253
aVthere s no top line 
p22254
aVso most human beings are suffering their freedom 
p22255
aVif you re suffering your bondage  understandable 
p22256
aVbut if you re suffering your freedom  that s a bad thing 
p22257
aVbut that s what is happening 
p22258
aVhuman problem is 
p22259
aV what to do with myself 
p22260
aVwhatever you do  it s not enough 
p22261
ag22261
aVif you had come like any other creature 
p22262
aVyour survival taken care of  everything is fine with you  isn t it 
p22263
aVeating  sleeping  reproduction  if it happens 
p22264
aVyou were fulfilled 
p22265
aVbut that is not the thing with human 
p22266
aVwhen these things are in question  they are big 
p22267
aVonce they happen  they are nothing 
p22268
aVso  this transition  what you re talking about 
p22269
aVhistorical movement of human beings in this country 
p22270
aVthere was a time when we hit a peak 
p22271
aVbut we became so absorbed in finer aspects of life 
p22272
aVwhat  that we did not have fighting men 
p22273
aVour biggest strength was 
p22274
aVwe were placed in a geographical crucible  where we were well protected 
p22275
aVwe called this hindustan 
p22276
aVnot after a religion  as people think it is today 
p22277
aVor some people think it s after a language 
p22278
ag22025
aVa land which lies between himalayas and the indu sagara or the indian ocean  this is hindu 
p22279
aVwhy we worship these two geographical features is 
p22280
aVwe knew our well being comes from these two features 
p22281
aVthe himalayan ranges and the indian ocean protected us 
p22282
aVso we could focus on the development of the human being 
p22283
aVwhen every other society was constantly ravaged by external forces 
p22284
aVwe remained untouched for a long period of time 
p22285
aVbut when people came 
p22286
aVthey did not come as invaders 
p22287
aVthey just came in few hundreds  
p22288
aVhundred  two hundred people 
p22289
aVthey were actually bandits 
p22290
aVthey wanted to rape  loot and run 
p22291
aVbut then they found 
p22292
aVpeople were so docile 
p22293
aVpeople were deeply involved in spirituality 
p22294
aVmathematics 
p22295
aVmusic 
p22296
aVastronomy 
p22297
aVsomebody who s looking at the stars can t fight 
p22298
aVsomeone who is singing music cannot fight  
p22299
aVsomebody who s into  you know  counting numbers
p22300
aVor doing mathematics cannot fight 
p22301
aVthey found this was such an easy land 
p22302
aVbandits became emperors 
p22303
aV they stayed there only 
p22304
aV they stayed back 
p22305
aVwhy run  
p22306
aVthey decided to stay back and they became emperors 
p22307
aVand these are not people with any administrative skills 
p22308
aVthey were barbarians 
p22309
aVso  they ruled that way 
p22310
aVso immense suffering happened 
p22311
aVbut we had an evolved sense of intellect and philosophy and ideology
p22312
aVthrough which we survived 
p22313
aVit doesn t matter how you beat them 
p22314
aVthey didn t fight back but they survived 
p22315
aVthey not only survived 
p22316
aVthey kept their culture 
p22317
aVthey kept their samskriti 
p22318
aVthey kept their tradition
p22319
aVto whatever extent they could and survived and survived and survived 
p22320
aVafter over a 1000 years of invasions and all kinds of rules over us 
p22321
aVstill this is the only culture on the planet 
p22322
aVwhich still has a flavor of its indigenous origins 
p22323
aVeverybody else is totally wiped out  
p22324
aVbut it has not been easy 
p22325
aVit has not been the best of times 
p22326
aVwhat was the greatest economic power on the planet
p22327
aVjust three hundred years ago 
p22328
aVwe became one of the poorest nations in a matter of two hundred and fifty to three hundred years 
p22329
aVi think at about two hundred and seventy years 
p22330
aVwe became the poorest nation
p22331
aVbecause everything was shipped out 
p22332
aVbut still  we re coming back once again 
p22333
aVwe have an intellect 
p22334
aVwe need a determined leadership to wake us up a little bit 
p22335
aVwe re little sleepy  you know 
p22336
aVbecause for generations 
p22337
aVten fifteen generations 
p22338
aVour mothers have taught us  never confront a problem on the street 
p22339
aVif you see a problem  come home  
p22340
ag21548
aVthis is what our mothers have taught us
p22341
aVbecause this is the mentality of an occupied nation  
p22342
aVdon t raise your head 
p22343
aVput it down and come home
p22344
aVbecause if you raise your head you may lose it 
p22345
aVbut if we want to generate leaders in the nation 
p22346
aVwe need people who seek problems and confront problems on a daily basis
p22347
ag21213
aVthe moment you seek and confront a problem 
p22348
aVhalf the nation resists 
p22349
aVit doesn t matter what s the problem  
p22350
aVsee  everybody was talking about black money  all right  
p22351
aVit was one of the conversations always going on 
p22352
aVwhen they don t have money 
p22353
aVthey would say somebody else has black money 
p22354
aV the money that i have is white 
p22355
aVwhat you have must be black    
p22356
aVthis has been the mindset 
p22357
aVbut when you try to take some action 
p22358
aVjust look at the voices all over 
p22359
aVis it the best action 
p22360
aVis it the wrong action 
p22361
aVthat s not the point 
p22362
aVwe can debate it endlessly 
p22363
aVbut the thing is 
p22364
aVit is some action in that direction  
p22365
aV we talk about sanskriti 
p22366
aVyou said about sanskriti 
p22367
aVand i wonder since my childhood
p22368
aVthat in my home and other places also 
p22369
aVi always find pundits chanting sanskrit mantra 
p22370
aVwe get married 
p22371
aVthe mantras are all in sanskrit 
p22372
aVwhether we understand them or not 
p22373
aV you re not supposed to understand all that  
p22374
aV that is what i was told 
p22375
aVand everywhere 
p22376
aVi find mantras and pundits 
p22377
aVon all auspicious occasion 
p22378
aVor whatever the occasion is 
p22379
aVand we respect somewhere 
p22380
aVlike the back of our mind  we respect our language 
p22381
aVancient language sanskrit 
p22382
aVbut when it comes to our kids to learn sanskrit 
p22383
aVwe tell them 
p22384
aV learn that language  which gives you a job 
p22385
aVthis will not give you a job 
p22386
aVand we are very shy
p22387
aVto allow them to learn sanskrit 
p22388
aVwhy it is so  sadhguru 
p22389
aV see  this is  as i said 
p22390
aVwe have experienced ten  twelve  almost fifteen generations of abject poverty 
p22391
aVso  when we re in such a state of poverty 
p22392
aVour only concern is our children should somehow survive 
p22393
aVsomehow get one degree 
p22394
aVget a job  
p22395
aVthis used to be the mantra in sixties and seventies 
p22396
aVget a government job somehow 
p22397
aVor become a doctor 
p22398
aVthat s the best thing 
p22399
aVyour life is made 
p22400
aVsomebody else gets sick but your life is made  
p22401
aVthis is coming from a certain fear
p22402
aVthat your children may not survive 
p22403
aVif they don t pass this  this  this examination 
p22404
aVthey may end up on the street 
p22405
aVbecause that s all the options there were 
p22406
aVthey 
p22407
aVit was not a false fear 
p22408
aVif your chi  child did not get educated 
p22409
aVunless he was super talented with something 
p22410
aVmost probably he ll end up as a street bum 
p22411
aVthat was a fact 
p22412
aVbut slowly things have changed 
p22413
aVour economic situation has changed dramatically 
p22414
aVwhether we want to recognize it or not 
p22415
aVin seventies how you were living and how you are living today 
p22416
aVthere is a phenomenal different in the material wealth 
p22417
aVso today  our children have many more options 
p22418
aVwe can little go slow on this job oriented education 
p22419
aVstill  there is a large segment of india 
p22420
aVwhich still has to go that way 
p22421
aVbut we 
p22422
aVthose who re reasonably well to do
p22423
aVcan go little slow on their children 
p22424
aVi created three different dimensions of education 
p22425
aVone is rural education 
p22426
aVwhich is called isha vidhya 
p22427
aVto bring awareness to this 
p22428
aVtomorrow we re golfing at wellingdon  
p22429
aVto bring awareness to rural education 
p22430
aVthis education is designed purely to get these children
p22431
aVout of their economic and social pit they re in 
p22432
aVthis is 
p22433
aVfrom the age of six  they re learning english language 
p22434
aVwithin one year  they become fluent in english language
p22435
aVand they start working on the computers 
p22436
aVthis english language and computer is their passport out of the village 
p22437
aVthis is the goal 
p22438
aVthis is run in a certain way 
p22439
aVwe have another school called isha home school 
p22440
aVthis is for the affluent 
p22441
aVthis is run in a completely different way
p22442
aVwith an enormous inclusion of sport  art  theater 
p22443
aVall kinds of music 
p22444
aVevery kind of thing that you can add to aesthetics to it 
p22445
aVthe school itself is created in a very aesthetic way 
p22446
aVso the children experience a different dimension of life 
p22447
aVand these children live in groups of twenty in a household
p22448
aVwith a dedicated couple 
p22449
aVwho are parents for these children for the first five years 
p22450
aVand the next five years  they ll have another set of parents 
p22451
aVthey move into a different house 
p22452
aVthese children grow up with enormous exposure to all kinds of talents 
p22453
aVfor example  now i made their eleventh and twelfth 
p22454
aVwhich is two years  into three years 
p22455
aVi said   in our school  it s three years 
p22456
aVbecause we have invested so much
p22457
aVon music  art  dance  theater  all these things 
p22458
aVthe moment they come to eleventh standard 
p22459
aVmany parents go marks mad 
p22460
aVsuddenly  marks  marks  marks will come 
p22461
aVthey want to drop the music 
p22462
aVthey want to drop every other art they ve learnt 
p22463
aVso i said three years 
p22464
aVso extra this one year 
p22465
aVwhatever they are good at 
p22466
aVthey will become much more proficient in that 
p22467
aVif they are good musicians  they will go into that 
p22468
aVif they re good in theater  they ll go into art 
p22469
aVwe re exposing them to leadership  management  business 
p22470
aVvariety of things 
p22471
aVbut your children will get out of the school one year late 
p22472
aVi think you can afford it because you re well to do 
p22473
aVyou have only one child or maybe two children 
p22474
aVit s all right 
p22475
aVyour child gets to work one year later 
p22476
aVit s perfectly okay 
p22477
aVinitially  everybody thought it s crazy 
p22478
aVnow everybody wants to be there 
p22479
aVanother dimension of education 
p22480
aVhere there is no formal education 
p22481
aVthere are only six things that they learn 
p22482
aVthey start with yoga 
p22483
aVkalari payattu  which is the mother of all martial arts 
p22484
aVclassical music 
p22485
aVclassical dance 
p22486
aVsanskrit language 
p22487
aVenglish language 
p22488
aVthis is all they study 
p22489
aVfirst four years  these six subjects 
p22490
aVafter four years  they will drop any two of them and keep that four 
p22491
aVand after another two and a half to three years  time 
p22492
aVthey ll drop two more 
p22493
aVand the next five years to six years 
p22494
aVthey will do only two subjects 
p22495
aVthey will become experts in that 
p22496
aVyou must come and see these children 
p22497
aVyou won t believe how they are 
p22498
aVthey are incredible because this is focused towards building the human body
p22499
aVand the human brain to its fullest 
p22500
aVif you want something to perform 
p22501
aVfirst thing is you must build the machine 
p22502
aVyou must build the machine to a higher level of capability 
p22503
aVthen only it ll perform 
p22504
aVright now  the biggest problem with the modern world is
p22505
aVwe are too goal oriented 
p22506
aVwe want to enhance our activity without enhancing who we are 
p22507
aVthis is why everybody is talking about stress 
p22508
aVwhatever simple jobs they re doing  they re stressful
p22509
aVbecause they have enhanced their activity without enhancing themselves 
p22510
aVit s like you take your maruti 800 on a racetrack 
p22511
aVit will fall apart  
p22512
aVit s not built for that  i m saying 
p22513
aVit s okay to go to your office 
p22514
aVif you race it  it ll  it ll break up 
p22515
aVso similarly  if you want to enhance your activity 
p22516
aVyou don t worry about the activity 
p22517
aVif you enhance the human being 
p22518
aVhe will perform the activity according to his capability 
p22519
aVso  this is focused on just developing the human being 
p22520
aVthese children are in another zone altogether 
p22521
aVfantastic 
p22522
aVi
p22523
aVyou won t believe it 
p22524
aVi must tell you this 
p22525
aVthe first batch  i was to initiate them about five years ago 
p22526
aVwhen they become fifteen years of age
p22527
aVthey stay with us from the age of six to eighteen 
p22528
aVwhen they become fifteen 
p22529
aVthree years they take brahmacharya 
p22530
aVit is three year period they must take
p22531
aVand at eighteen  they must go off 
p22532
aVit is not compulsory beyond that  
p22533
aVtill that point because we want them to focus 
p22534
aVwhen i had to initiate them at the age of fifteen 
p22535
aVthey go for a sixty days of silence  okay 
p22536
aVtotal silence   
p22537
aVi have to initiate them 
p22538
aVi want to see how the children are doing 
p22539
aVabout three four days before the initiation 
p22540
aVi go there to see them 
p22541
aV30 in the evening 
p22542
aVokay 
p22543
aVin a day  at least six hours 
p22544
aVthey are sitting with their eyes closed
p22545
aVdoing sadhana 
p22546
aVand all kinds of sadhana  
p22547
aVat least about eleven to twelve hours of sadhana 
p22548
aVin this  at least six hours  they re sitting with eyes closed 
p22549
aV30 in the morning 
p22550
aVthe first batch was only fourteen 
p22551
aVtoday its grown into big number 
p22552
aVi go there and sit with them 
p22553
aVnearly half of them are girls and the rest are boys 
p22554
aVi went and sat 
p22555
aVi  i just looked at these children 
p22556
aVthey were literally glowing 
p22557
aVi sat there and wept
p22558
aVbecause i was not like this when i was fifteen 
p22559
aVi know that very well 
p22560
aVthese children are literally glowing like lights 
p22561
aVthey re just sitting like this 
p22562
aVunmoving 
p22563
aVi just sat there for over two hours 
p22564
aVthey didn t move a bit 
p22565
aVthey just sat like stone 
p22566
aVi just bowed down to them and came that 
p22567
aVthis is fantastic   
p22568
aVthey are only fifteen  fifteen year old children  
p22569
aV that is exactly when i said
p22570
aVthe right kind of education 
p22571
aVthis is the right kind of education 
p22572
aV yes  but at the same time 
p22573
aVas i said  we are a huge population 
p22574
aVif we want to improve our education
p22575
aV it has to grow 
p22576
aV if we want to improve our education 
p22577
aVif we want to improve nourishment 
p22578
aVif we want to improve the traffic situation 
p22579
aVif we want to improve anything in this country 
p22580
aVwe have to reduce our population 
p22581
aVthere is no other way  
p22582
aV one very interesting question in my mind i ve been facing since my childhood
p22583
aVwe are talking
p22584
aVall due respect to the belief of every guru and
p22585
aV no  you don t have to respect my belief
p22586
aVbecause i don t have any  
p22587
aV when you are talking about the adiyogi
p22588
aVthe great lord shiva 
p22589
aVi remember my mother used to go to lord shiva s temple
p22590
aVand i used to accompany her 
p22591
aVand she would tell me that lord shiva belongs to the three lokas  
p22592
aVdharti 
p22593
aVakash 
p22594
aVpataal 
p22595
aVso my father brought one globe showing the geography of the earth
p22596
aVand i asked my mother 
p22597
aV is lord shiva
p22598
aVyou re talking about the three worlds   
p22599
aVi turned the globe 
p22600
aVi said  
p22601
aV does these americans know lord shiva 
p22602
aVso is lord shiva territorial or universal 
p22603
aVthat still question lies in me  
p22604
aV let s understand this in the right context 
p22605
aVthe word shiva  
p22606
aVshi va means that which is not 
p22607
aVthat which is  is physical creation 
p22608
aVthat which is not  is that which is not physical 
p22609
aVthat which is not  where can it be 
p22610
aVin india or america  
p22611
aVor on this planet or in another galaxy 
p22612
aVwhere can it be 
p22613
aVit s everywhere 
p22614
aVso  there is a dimensionless existence 
p22615
aVso we called it appropriately  
p22616
aVshi va  that means that which is not 
p22617
aVtoday  modern scientists are saying
p22618
aVthat nearly ninety nine percent of the cosmos is empty 
p22619
aVbut not that there is nothing  
p22620
aVthere is something but it is not something 
p22621
aVbecause our idea of something is
p22622
aVwe should be able to perceive through five senses 
p22623
aVsee right now 
p22624
aVwhat you can see and what you cannot see is this 
p22625
aVyou can see my hand because it is stopping light 
p22626
aVanything that is not stopping light  you don t see  isn t it 
p22627
aVright now  there is air here  which you re breathing 
p22628
aVwhich is most vital from your  for your existence 
p22629
aVbut you don t see it 
p22630
aVyou don t see the air unless you live in delhi  
p22631
aVthat s the privilege of being in the capital city  
p22632
aVnow  if you look up in the sky  you see the stars 
p22633
aVbut stars are a small happening 
p22634
aVthe real thing is the vast emptiness 
p22635
aVso this we referred to as shi va  that which is not 
p22636
ag22618
aVthis vast space has a tremendous amount of energy 
p22637
aVbut it is not any of the energies that are measurable by us 
p22638
aVlike electromagnetic waves 
p22639
aVor weak nuclear energy 
p22640
aVor strong nuclear energy 
p22641
aVor electrical systems 
p22642
aVor microwaves 
p22643
aVnone of these things 
p22644
aVit is none of the measurable energies 
p22645
aVbut there is no denying it is tremendously powerful 
p22646
aVso we said shi va means that which is not 
p22647
aVand we said it is in the lap of shiva that creation happens 
p22648
aVat the same time 
p22649
aVwe called adiyogi also the shiva
p22650
aVbecause he perceived that which is not 
p22651
aVyou are who you are
p22652
aVpeople call you a director  a film producer  why 
p22653
aVbecause you perceived something 
p22654
aVif you did not perceive that  they would not recognize you as that 
p22655
aVso we recognized adiyogi as shiva
p22656
ag22651
aVbecause he perceived that  we called him also shiva 
p22657
aVthen maybe there are any number of people
p22658
aVat least in southern india 
p22659
aValmost ninety percent of the males are named after shiva 
p22660
aVwe call that man also shiva
p22661
aVbecause we know if he does the right things 
p22662
aVhe can also realize that he is shiva 
p22663
aVwe named our dog also shiva 
p22664
ag21548
aVbecause we know he is also made of the same stuff 
p22665
aVbut he does not know 
p22666
aVbut we must remind him by naming him shiva  
p22667
aVwe ll call the dog also shiva  shiva  no problem 
p22668
aVin another country  in another religion 
p22669
aVthey would be very insulted if you named your dog by their god s name 
p22670
aVbut you ll see in the villages 
p22671
aVdogs in
p22672
aVonly in the cities  they have this problem  
p22673
aVall their dogs have english names  
p22674
aVthis is because
p22675
aVthis pet dog business came from the english people 
p22676
aVfor us  dogs were there on the street
p22677
aVand we never taught of taking dogs and fondling them like this   
p22678
aVonly the english were doing it
p22679
aVbecause they were away from home
p22680
aVand they must have been feeling lonely  
p22681
aV that s the reason  yes 
p22682
aV now you see in india 
p22683
aVevery so called middle class family  
p22684
aVall their dogs have english names 
p22685
aVso  we will call the ultimate reality as shiva 
p22686
aVthe one who realized that 
p22687
aVthe adiyogi  as shiva 
p22688
aVone who did not realize that but has the possibility 
p22689
aVwe ll call him shiva 
p22690
aVwe ll call the dog also shiva
p22691
aVbecause he is also made of the same stuff 
p22692
aVbut he cannot know 
p22693
aVbut we want him to hear that sound 
p22694
aVso every time we call him shiva  shiva  shiva 
p22695
aVwe hope that we will evolve one day  
p22696
aV thank you very much for enlightening us 
p22697
aVabout the real meaning of shiva  so much
p22698
aV and for those of you who do not know 
p22699
aVnow  on this twenty fourth of february 
p22700
aVwe are unveiling a  a face of adiyogi 
p22701
aVwhich is hundred and twelve feet tall
p22702
aVbecause  adiyogi
p22703
aVadiyogi offered one hundred and twelve ways
p22704
aVin which a human being can realize his ultimate potential 
p22705
aVhundred and twelve ways to do it 
p22706
aVso as a way of honoring him
p22707
aVand also to bring back this dimension 
p22708
aVthat your well being is not in looking up or looking down
p22709
aVbut looking inward 
p22710
aVwhen we looked up in search of our well being 
p22711
aVwe became hallucinatory 
p22712
aVthen as modern societies 
p22713
aVas science and technology came 
p22714
aVwe started looking out for our well being 
p22715
aVonce we started looking out for our well being 
p22716
aVin pursuit of human well being
p22717
aVwe have ripped the planet apart 
p22718
aVtrue well being will happen to a human being
p22719
aVonly when they turn inward 
p22720
aVto bring this revolution back into the world 
p22721
aVfor the next generation of people particularly 
p22722
aVwe built this iconic face 
p22723
aVand a book is also ready now 
p22724
aVthe idea is to move people inward 
p22725
aVnot up 
p22726
aVnot out 
p22727
aVin  
p22728
aVin is the only way out  
p22729
aV sadhguru  i
p22730
aV can we show the image of adiyogi  is it possible 
p22731
ag21224
aV on the screen 
p22732
aV but i must say
p22733
aV this is the largest face on the planet 
p22734
ag21224
aVi ve gone through your book 
p22735
aVit s amazing amazing book and so much enlightenment in it 
p22736
aVbut the best line which i found was
p22737
aVthat you said in your book 
p22738
aV your joy  your miseries  your love  your agony  your bliss 
p22739
aVall lie in your hand 
p22740
aVsome are suffering their failures 
p22741
aVsome are suffering their consequences of their success 
p22742
aVsome are suffering their limitation
p22743
aVand some are suffering their freedom 
p22744
aVwhat s the way out  
p22745
aV in is the way out 
p22746
aVbecause all human experience is caused from within us 
p22747
aV it s within us 
p22748
aV everything that ever happens to you happens within you 
p22749
aVwhat happens within you must happen your way  isn t it 
p22750
aVright now  we are trying to fix the world to fix this one  
p22751
aVit s not going to work like that 
p22752
aVif you fix this one  
p22753
aVthen we can create a world the way we want it 
p22754
aVbut right now  we think by fixing the world 
p22755
aVthis is going to be all right 
p22756
aVit s not gonna happen like that 
p22757
aV great  great enlightenment

aS'but there was no elite'
p23416
aS'everybody could read and write'
p23417
aS'i do everybody '

aS'so they wondered how does this happen'
p23419
aS'then they realized the system is so organic'
p23420
aS'that it is simply happening from within'
p23421
aS'so the first thing that decided was'
p23422
aS'we must destroy this education system'

aVwhen i ve gone into a talk or a conversation 
p24389
aVit really is the first time that i was compelled to do so  
p24390
aVcompelled by the stature 
p24391
aVthe profundity 
p24392
aVand the intensity of sadhguruji 
p24393
aVand then i did something that i haven t done in a few years 
p24394
aVi actually made notes
p24395
aVjust so that i don t make any mistakes 
p24396
aV you can't make a mistake asking questions  
p24397
aV sadhguruji  i have been told
p24398
aVthat every man 
p24399
aVevery woman 
p24400
aVevery child has come into this world with a mission 
p24401
aVand until that mission is complete 
p24402
aVhe keeps taking rebirth 
p24403
aVi don t know whether the concept of rebirth is true or not
p24404
aVbut i do believe that everyone is here with a mission 
p24405
aVhow does one find out
p24406
aVwhat that mission is
p24407
aVand what does it take to get there 
p24408
aV oh 
p24409
aVwhat i say may not be very pleasant  
p24410
aVwhat is true may not always be pleasant 
p24411
aVwhat is pleasant need not be true 
p24412
aVbut why truth is important is
p24413
aVbecause it works 
p24414
aVpleasant things will bring solace to individual people 
p24415
aVsolace means
p24416
aVyou re seeking somebody s help
p24417
aVto handle your psychological drama 
p24418
aVtruth means
p24419
aVyou re interested in the solution  not in solace 
p24420
aVso
p24421
aVthis mission aspect
p24422
aVall the problems on the planet is simply because
p24423
aVeverybody has their own mission
p24424
aVand these missions are
p24425
aVcreating variety of conflict 
p24426
aVif all of us sit here
p24427
aVwithout any mission
p24428
aVmission means an assumed position of importance and agenda  
p24429
aVindividual agenda 
p24430
aVif all of us can sit here without any individual agenda 
p24431
aVif our hearts beat just as life 
p24432
aVnot as a man 
p24433
aVnot as a woman 
p24434
aVnot as this party or that party
p24435
aVor this religion or that religion 
p24436
aVsimply as life 
p24437
aVall of us will be very
p24438
aVwill be able to see very clearly
p24439
aVwhat is it that is most essential right now in the world 
p24440
aVboth for the individual and for the larger world 
p24441
aVbecause every one of us have taken up this assumed
p24442
aVmissionary positions 
p24443
aVin our fervor of our own missions  
p24444
aVvery brutal things are being done in the world 
p24445
aVpeople who even believe
p24446
aVi mean  mission is always god given unfortunately 
p24447
aVyou can look back on the history of humanity and see
p24448
aVwhenever somebody said
p24449
aV god spoke to me 
p24450
aVterrible things happened around them 
p24451
aVin recent times
p24452
aVa president of a major nation said 
p24453
aV god told me 
p24454
aVsince then over a million people are dead 
p24455
aVthree countries are ruined
p24456
aVand it has bred something that you cannot contain
p24457
aVprobably in the next hundred years
p24458
aVbecause god spoke to him 
p24459
aVso  there are too many assumptions in this 
p24460
aVthere are too many assumptions involved 
p24461
aVfirst of all 
p24462
aVto think that i have a god given mission 
p24463
aVthere is an exaggerated sense of importance for the human being 
p24464
aVsomewhere 
p24465
aVthere is a ridiculous idea that
p24466
aVhuman beings are central to the creation 
p24467
aVor the cosmos is human centric 
p24468
aVno 
p24469
aVtomorrow morning
p24470
aVif this entire solar system evaporates 
p24471
aVit will not even be noticed 
p24472
aVthat is how vast it is  
p24473
aVcreation 
p24474
aVall of us 
p24475
aVincluding the sun and the moon and all the planets 
p24476
aVif we just evaporate tomorrow 
p24477
aVit will not even be noticed  
p24478
aVit's such a small speck 
p24479
aVthis tiny speck which we call as solar system 
p24480
aVin that 
p24481
aVplanet earth is a micro speck 
p24482
aVin that micro speck 
p24483
aVkolkata is a super micro speck 
p24484
ag24481
aVyou are a big man  
p24485
aVand now everybody has their own god given missions  
p24486
aVwhatever 
p24487
aVthe most horrendous things that are happening on the planet right now 
p24488
aVin middle east 
p24489
aVall these horrendous things are happening
p24490
aVbecause they firmly believe
p24491
aVthey re doing god s work 
p24492
aVlet's understand this  
p24493
aVsitting here we may think 
p24494
aV oh  these are all some cavemen or nut cases from somewhere 
p24495
ag24469
ag24469
ag24469
ag24492
aVthey truly believe it 
p24496
aVif they did not believe it 
p24497
aVthey wouldn t pitch their life for it  isn't it 
p24498
aVany man who pitches his life
p24499
aVfor whatever he thinks is right or whatever he believes 
p24500
aVyou have to at least trust
p24501
aVhe s sincere about it  
p24502
aVis he sensible 
p24503
aVthat s another question
p24504
aVbut is he sincere 
p24505
aVhe is 
p24506
aVotherwise he wouldn t pitch his life
p24507
aVbecause it is in the very intrinsic nature of life
p24508
aVwhether you re a man  woman  or an ant for that matter  
p24509
aVif you try to catch an ant 
p24510
aVhe will do everything possible to save his life  isn t it 
p24511
aVhe does not think 
p24512
aV it's just an ant s life  let me shed it 
p24513
aVno  no  no 
p24514
aVit's very valuable for him 
p24515
aVthis is the intrinsic nature of life  
p24516
aVthat  every life values itself for what it is 
p24517
aVnow  because most human beings have done nothing
p24518
aVabout experiencing the intrinsic value of life
p24519
aVright now  i would say most human beings are not life 
p24520
aVthey re a bundle of thoughts 
p24521
aVemotions 
p24522
aVideas 
p24523
aVopinions
p24524
aVand prejudices 
p24525
aVbecause they have become this 
p24526
aVnow they re coming up with another idea  
p24527
aVthey have a god given mission 
p24528
aVthere is no mission 
p24529
aVlife is a phenomena beyond missions 
p24530
aVit is bigger than any silly mission we can think about 
p24531
aVit is more profound 
p24532
aVmore organic
p24533
aVand more phenomenal
p24534
aVthan anything human mind can ever think about 
p24535
aVour missions
p24536
aVlocal missions we can have 
p24537
aVright now you can have a mission  
p24538
aV i don t want a single home in kolkata without electricity   
p24539
aVthis s your local mission  it's fine 
p24540
aVbut this is not a god given mission 
p24541
aVthis is a sensible mission that you come to
p24542
aVbecause so many people are living in darkness 
p24543
aVthat s fine 
p24544
aVeverybody can come up with missions like this
p24545
aVout of your sense 
p24546
aVbut the moment you have a god given mission 
p24547
aVyou re a danger to the world  
p24548
aVyes  
p24549
aV is there salvation 
p24550
aVand if so  what is it 
p24551
aV salvation from what 
p24552
aV salvation from birth and rebirth 
p24553
aV so you believe
p24554
aVyou are here many times over  
p24555
aVsee 
p24556
aVif you want to know something 
p24557
aVif you want to know anything 
p24558
aVgenuinely if you want to know something
p24559
aVhello  the people in the upper regions 
p24560
aVare you with us 
p24561
aV yes
p24562
aV oh  good 
p24563
aV can you increase the volume a bit 
p24564
aV they want a little more volume 
p24565
aV increase it 
p24566
aV more volume 
p24567
aV yes 
p24568
aV whoever  the control  sir  please  can you 
p24569
aVis this good 
p24570
aVhello 
p24571
aV yes  it's good 
p24572
aV okay 
p24573
aVsee  if we are in pursuit of truth 
p24574
aVthe most important thing is
p24575
aVwe don t assume anything 
p24576
aVyou become a genuine seeker
p24577
aVonly when you realize  i do not know 
p24578
aVthose who do not realize
p24579
aVthe immensity of  i do not know 
p24580
aVthey will believe something 
p24581
aVthe moment you believe something 
p24582
aVyou get identified with it 
p24583
aVthe moment you get identified with it 
p24584
aVyour mind is a prejudiced mind 
p24585
aVit will only work around that 
p24586
aVwhy is it so difficult
p24587
aVfor human beings to say
p24588
aV i don t know 
p24589
aVthe fact of the matter is you don t know 
p24590
aVwhere the hell you came from 
p24591
aVwhere you re going 
p24592
aVwhat is the nature of your existence  
p24593
aVyou don t know  isn't it 
p24594
aVwhy can't we say  i don t know 
p24595
aVis it okay 
p24596
ag24571
ag24562
aV is it all right   
p24597
aV what i know  i know 
p24598
aVwhat i do not know  i do not know 
p24599
ag24596
ag24562
aV but right now the tendency in the world 
p24600
aVthe training in the world is
p24601
aVwhatever you do not know you believe  
p24602
aVbelief needs support 
p24603
aVbelief needs social support 
p24604
aVyou just believe something
p24605
aVthat nobody here endorses 
p24606
aVyou will start
p24607
aVgoing looking for forming your own society
p24608
aVwhich believes what you believe 
p24609
aVif you believe something and nobody else believes what you believe 
p24610
aVsuddenly you look ridiculous  isn't it 
p24611
aVso you ll always gather numbers around you 
p24612
aVthe moment you gather numbers
p24613
aVwell 
p24614
aVnumbers are useful in a democratic process
p24615
aVbut numbers are not useful in seeking
p24616
aVbecause a crowd cannot seek 
p24617
aVonly individual intelligence can seek 
p24618
aVonly the longing within an individual human being is capable of seeking 
p24619
aVa crowd cannot seek anything 
p24620
aVso in many ways when you get identified with a particular belief system 
p24621
aVyou have become a crowd 
p24622
aVyou are no more an individual 
p24623
aVif you ask anybody  they will say
p24624
aVokay  for example  reincarnation 
p24625
aVthey ll say reincarnation  
p24626
aVif i say this is all rubbish 
p24627
aVthey will say   but gita says this 
p24628
aVso  you have an authority which said it 
p24629
aVbecause krishna said it  it must be true 
p24630
aVin future 
p24631
aVsomebody will say  sadhguru said it 
p24632
aVit doesn t matter who said it 
p24633
aVthe question is  
p24634
aVdo you want authority to be the truth
p24635
aVor do you want the truth to be the authority 
p24636
aVif you want the truth to be the authority in your life  
p24637
aVbecause that s the only thing that works  
p24638
aVthen we must come to this much  
p24639
aVwe must realize the immensity of  i do not know 
p24640
aV i do not know 
p24641
aVis the basis of all knowing 
p24642
aVwhen you truly  truly realize  i do not know 
p24643
aVwanting to know 
p24644
aVlonging to know 
p24645
aVseeking to know 
p24646
aVand the possibility of knowing becomes a living reality 
p24647
aVotherwise  you believe one thing 
p24648
aVi believe one thing 
p24649
aVi ll form one party 
p24650
aVyou will form another party 
p24651
aVwe will pretend we are brothers 
p24652
aVwhen it come we ll hag  hack each other  
p24653
ag24549
aVi don t have to say this 
p24654
aVyou re seeing enough examples right through history  right 
p24655
aVwe will
p24656
aVwe will say 
p24657
aV we are all brothers 
p24658
aVwe are wonderful like this 
p24659
aVwe respect your belief  i respect my belief 
p24660
aVbut when it really comes to the crunch 
p24661
aVwe will hack each other 
p24662
aVnot once 
p24663
aVthousands of times we ve been doing the same thing 
p24664
aVwon't we ever learn 
p24665
aVso  what you re asking is not about reincarnation 
p24666
aVor in a way
p24667
aVyou re asking what happens beyond death 
p24668
aVtch  some things you know best only by experience  
p24669
aVnow 
p24670
aVessentially what you re asking is  
p24671
aV what is the nature of my existence 
p24672
aVit gets clothed in so many things 
p24673
aVjust now 
p24674
aVsome time ago i was in conversation with harsh 
p24675
aVhe burst car tires 
p24676
aVhe
p24677
aVwhat 
p24678
aVhe took me to middle east 
p24679
aVhe made me cross pakistan border  many things 
p24680
aVbut fundamentally what you re asking is  
p24681
ag24672
aVif you want to know the nature of your existence 
p24682
aVyou just have to pay attention to this one  right now 
p24683
aVtch  you said a word which i keep on demolishing wherever i go 
p24684
aVyou said  corporate world 
p24685
aVthere is no corporate world  
p24686
aVthere is just one world  
p24687
aVso  the moment you belong to one world 
p24688
aVi belong to another world 
p24689
aVintergalactic fight will happen  
p24690
aVso  we are just in this world 
p24691
aVif you pay attention  how you have happened
p24692
aVright now  when you and me sit here 
p24693
ag24614
aVi have my physical presence 
p24694
aVyou have your physical presence 
p24695
aVand everybody else has their physical boundaries  
p24696
aVthis is my boundary 
p24697
aVthat is your boundary 
p24698
aVthat is somebody else s boundary 
p24699
aVthis physical body which is defining your boundary right now 
p24700
aVhow did it happen 
p24701
aVin bengal 
p24702
aVmaybe it's just fish and rice  
p24703
aVwhat else do you eat  hmm 
p24704
aVwhat else 
p24705
aV that s not your diet  
p24706
aV rasagulla 
p24707
aV yeah  maybe 
p24708
aVso fish  rice  and rasagulla in the head  
p24709
aVno  i m saying you re sweet 
p24710
aVso  fundamentally 
p24711
aVwe accumulated this body by ingesting food 
p24712
aVwhat we call as food is just actually a piece of the planet 
p24713
aVit's good to get it now 
p24714
aVif you experience this now 
p24715
aVif this becomes a living reality  
p24716
aVyou understand this is just a piece of the planet 
p24717
aVlittle bit of topsoil i picked up
p24718
aVand i m walking around 
p24719
aVwell  you can carry your topsoil in style
p24720
aVor in a clumsy manner  
p24721
aVit's up to you 
p24722
aVbut it is just topsoil 
p24723
aVif you don t get it now 
p24724
aVone day you will anyway get it from the maggots 
p24725
ag24549
aVone day when they bury you or burn you 
p24726
aVanyway you will get it  isn't it 
p24727
aVso what you accumulate 
p24728
aVwhatever you accumulate can be yours at the most for now 
p24729
aVbut cannot be you  isn't it 
p24730
aVanything that you accumulate you can claim 
p24731
aV is mine 
p24732
aVbut if you say   it is me 
p24733
aVit amounts to
p24734
aVeven by medical definition
p24735
aVyou are psychologically off  
p24736
aVyes  that s what it means 
p24737
aVsuppose i say 
p24738
aV i m this furniture 
p24739
aVpeople know i have lost it 
p24740
aVthis is happening every day 
p24741
aVfood appears in your plate 
p24742
aVyou say   this is my food 
p24743
aVyou eat it and immediately say 
p24744
aV this is me 
p24745
aVso if you want to know the nature of your existence 
p24746
aVone simple thing you can do is 
p24747
aVtonight before you fall asleep
p24748
aVif this is a genuine question
p24749
aVis it a question or is it entertainment 
p24750
aVis it a genuine question 
p24751
aVit will become a genuine question
p24752
aVwhen your bones start creaking
p24753
aVand you know mortality starts knocking on your doors 
p24754
aVoh  am i saying something wrong 
p24755
aVdo you know all of you are mortal 
p24756
aVi am saying  do you know
p24757
aVeven if you re in the upper regions you will die one day 
p24758
aVthat s all i m asking  
p24759
ag24571
ag24568
aV is it okay 
p24760
ag24568
aV this is not my wish 
p24761
aVi ll bless you with a long life 
p24762
aVbut with or without me 
p24763
aVyou ll anyway die 
p24764
aVlot of people believe other people die  
p24765
ag24469
aVyou and me will die  
p24766
aVyou and me will die 
p24767
aVnot today 
p24768
aVwe don t want it today
p24769
aVbut when it's time we will die 
p24770
aVso everything that you have accumulated
p24771
aVwill become meaningless on that day 
p24772
aVright now if you learn 
p24773
aVtonight before you go to bed 
p24774
aVif you can sit on your bed 
p24775
aVeverything that you are not 
p24776
aVeverything that you have accumulated 
p24777
aVfor two minutes you keep it aside
p24778
aVand just go to bed
p24779
aVgo to sleep 
p24780
aVif you sleep with this much awareness every day 
p24781
aVone day you may wake up enlightened 
p24782
aVyes   
p24783
aVyou will know the nature of your existence 
p24784
aVbecause right now if i tell you 
p24785
aV sanjiv 
p24786
aVthe nature of your existence 
p24787
aVyour atma
p24788
aVyou know how atma came 
p24789
aVit is a drop of paramatma   
p24790
aVi can tell you many things 
p24791
aVbut till it becomes a living experience for you 
p24792
aVit is just a story  isn't it 
p24793
aVstories will add color to our life
p24794
aVbut will not bring truth and liberation to our life 
p24795
aVyou re talking about salvation 
p24796
aVif the longing for salvation is genuine 
p24797
aVthen stories are only entertainment 
p24798
aVit doesn t matter whether the story came from ancient scripture
p24799
aVor story came from a contemporary guru 
p24800
aVit is just entertainment 
p24801
aVbut there are methods 
p24802
aVi m 
p24803
aVi m not known to be an entertainer 
p24804
aVi do brutal things in a pleasant manner  
p24805
aVvery brutal things but in a pleasant manner 
p24806
aVpeople like it ultimately because it works  
p24807
aVultimately all that matters in this life is
p24808
aVwhat works and what doesn t work  isn't it 
p24809
aVyes

aVwhat works is ultimately matters  isn't it 
p24814
aVwhat doesn t work  however pretty it is 
p24815
aVdoesn t jell after sometime 
p24816
aVso if we are seeking salvation 
p24817
aVif
p24818
aVdon t seek salvation 
p24819
aVjust 
p24820
aVinstead of waiting for that day
p24821
aVwhen you will sit on your death bed and wonder
p24822
aVwhat is this all about 
p24823
aVtonight you sit on your bed and wonder
p24824
ag24823
aVlet
p24825
aVyou come down to reality 
p24826
aVright now you re running away with your psychological drama to such an extent 
p24827
aVthe existential is completely missing 
p24828
aVif you pay attention 
p24829
aVyou will see
p24830
aVand you will constantly be aware of your mortal nature 
p24831
aVthat means you know you shall also die 
p24832
aVthis is not a negative thought 
p24833
aVthis means your time will get organized in a most sensible manner 
p24834
aVwhen you know you re on a limited leash of time 
p24835
aVyour time will get organized in a most sensible manner 
p24836
aVif you re conscious that you will also die
p24837
aVand it could be any day
p24838
aVokay  we are planning for this many years 
p24839
aVbut nobody here has come with a guarantee card 
p24840
aVhave you 
p24841
aV no 
p24842
aV so it could be today 
p24843
aVif you re conscious of this 
p24844
aVdo you have time to do anything that doesn t truly matter to you 
p24845
aVyou will do only what really matters to you 
p24846
aVwhen every human being is doing only what truly  truly matters to them 
p24847
aVthis is a beautiful world 
p24848
aVright now they re doing too much rubbish  
p24849
aV being a very deep cricket enthusiast
p24850
aVand now somewhat involved with the sport 
p24851
aVi see with admiration 
p24852
aVthe rise and rise and rise of virat kohli  
p24853
aVi see his energy on the field 
p24854
aVi see his energy off the field 
p24855
aVi see the way he s transforming and rewriting the rules of the game 
p24856
aVthe t20 format
p24857
aV140 to 160 was par score 
p24858
aVhe s redefined it 
p24859
aVnow 190 is a par 
p24860
aV 250
p24861
aV 250  240 
p24862
aVthere is something within him that propels him more than others 
p24863
aVthere are many people who are talented 
p24864
aVthere are many people who have this ability 
p24865
aVbut there are few who realize this ability 
p24866
aVwhat is it that takes one to realize
p24867
aVthat he can do a little more 
p24868
aVhe can inspire more 
p24869
aVhe can create more 
p24870
aVhe can create new standards 
p24871
aVis there something from within
p24872
aVor is it something from outside 
p24873
aVwhat is it 
p24874
aV i have also been watching virat kohli with interest
p24875
aVbecause
p24876
aVi have seen every great batsman in the last forty  forty five years 
p24877
aVvery few have hit the ball the way he s hitting it 
p24878
aVprobably the only other person that i can think of is vivian richards  
p24879
aVwho used to hit the ball like this 
p24880
aVbut he did not have the sane
p24881
aVsame sense of mission that this boy has  
p24882
aVhe just played for fun and you know  an island  caribbean culture 
p24883
aVand he kind of didn t take it so seriously 
p24884
aVor did not go at it with a certain zeal
p24885
aVwith which this boy is going 
p24886
aVbut i think he was the only one who was striking the ball
p24887
aVthe way this boy is striking today  which is very rare 
p24888
aVmost people  who have watched only cricket on the television 
p24889
aVdon t understand this probably 
p24890
aVit's one of the most dangerous games on the planet 
p24891
aVa hard ball is coming at you over hundred and thirty  hundred and forty kilometers per hour
p24892
aVand this is the only sport where the ball is pitched
p24893
aVand it swings this way  that way 
p24894
aVwhich gives you a fraction of a second to make your decision
p24895
aVhow to handle that ball 
p24896
aVit's  it's a very dangerous game 
p24897
aVyou must  you know  there re bowling machines 
p24898
aVthey may be there in kolkata 
p24899
ag24810
aVthe bowling machines are there 
p24900
aVyoung men  i m telling you 
p24901
aVdon t try hundred and forty kilometers 
p24902
aVat eighty or ninety kilometers 
p24903
aVjust  make
p24904
aVset the bowling machine at ninety kilometers
p24905
aVand stand there and see how the ball comes at you 
p24906
aVit's crazy  okay 
p24907
aVso  every ball is different  the way it's coming at you 
p24908
aVso it needs to be handled 
p24909
aVeverybody who is there we must understand is very good  
p24910
aVthey may look clumsy  they may get out for zero
p24911
aVbut they re very good with what they re doing 
p24912
aVbut somebody stands out like this 
p24913
aVthis reminds me of
p24914
aVthere was a motorcycle rider who is known as
p24915
aVwhose name was kenny roberts 
p24916
aVwho won the world championships five times in a row 
p24917
aVpeople couldn t believe it because
p24918
aVyou have to win sixteen races across the country to get to the championship 
p24919
aVall the machines are prepared by the top companies
p24920
aVand the talent is at the highest level 
p24921
aVbut winning five in a row was considered unprecedented and impossible 
p24922
aVso they asked him 
p24923
aV how do you do this 
p24924
aVso he said 
p24925
aV i go out of control with control   
p24926
aVi understand that very well  
p24927
aVi live every step of my life like that  
p24928
aValways out of control  but with control  
p24929
aVthis is what everybody is seeking 
p24930
aVthey want little madness in their life 
p24931
aVbut they don t want to go insane 
p24932
aVbut their longing for safety and security
p24933
aVmakes them insulate themselves from that little madness 
p24934
aVthen they wonder
p24935
aV what's happened to my life 
p24936
aVit's becoming boring and no good 
p24937
aVthey try to step out 
p24938
aVthen they get hit by something 
p24939
aVthey again build walls around them 
p24940
aVthis process is going on 
p24941
aVso when you take an example like this  
p24942
aVone thing is the zeal 
p24943
aVanother thing is loving what you re doing 
p24944
aVreally loving what you re doing 
p24945
aVthat s what you want to do 
p24946
aVthis once happened 
p24947
aVi was just walking into the chennai airport
p24948
aVand the indian hockey team was leaving for germany for champions trophy that year 
p24949
aVa few years ago the indian hockey team came and spent
p24950
aVa week or ten days in the yoga center
p24951
aVand we had helped the previous team
p24952
aVbut this was a new team 
p24953
aVso when i walked in  kps gill   was there
p24954
aVand he saw me and said 
p24955
aV sadhguru  you must come and speak to the boys 
p24956
aVwe have a psychologist who is speaking to them right now   
p24957
aVin the airport just before they leave for germany 
p24958
aVmany of these boys have never  gone out of the country 
p24959
aVfor the first time  they re going 
p24960
aVat that time  half the team was from the tribal belt
p24961
aVbecause they all came off the tata academy 
p24962
aVso they
p24963
aVi went there to see what they re talking 
p24964
aVso this psychologist is trying to pep them up 
p24965
aVhe is telling them
p24966
aVi can't repeat this in hindi 
p24967
aVbut he s telling them 
p24968
aV your parents have brought you up 
p24969
aVyou have to bring pride to them 
p24970
aVone billion people 
p24971
aVfull bharat is watching you 
p24972
aVyou cannot disappoint them 
p24973
aVthese boys  
p24974
aVthese are all eighteen  nineteen year old boys from the tribal belt 
p24975
aVone billion people  their expectations
p24976
aVand their parents  honor 
p24977
aVthey re just dazed like this   
p24978
aVso they asked me to speak 
p24979
aVi said   see 
p24980
aVi asked them   do you guys know how to play hockey 
p24981
aVi asked them to bring the sticks and the
p24982
aVi played hockey right through my school and college 
p24983
aVso i said 
p24984
aV you guys 
p24985
aVdo you know how to play hockey 
p24986
aVthey said   yes 
p24987
aVi said   no 
p24988
aVyou guys don t know how to play hockey 
p24989
aVthey said   no 
p24990
aVsuddenly they became 
p24991
aV no  no  we know how to play hockey 
p24992
aV then if you know how to play hockey 
p24993
aVthis is all you do 
p24994
aVthose seventy minutes 
p24995
aVthe ball must be continuously in the goal 
p24996
aVthat s your goal 
p24997
aVyou want the ball to be constantly in the opposite goal 
p24998
aVdon t try to beat germany and pakistan and somebody and somebody 
p24999
aVjust put the ball in the goal 
p25000
aVyou like to do it  isn't it 
p25001
aV yes  we like to do it 
p25002
aVsaid   just do that 
p25003
aVforget about bharat and your parents and everybody 
p25004
aVfor some time 
p25005
aVand last
p25006
aVone of these conversations i had in hyderabad 
p25007
aVone of the film actors 
p25008
aVhis final question is 
p25009
aV sadhguru  all this is okay 
p25010
aVbut in cricket 
p25011
aVhow to beat pakistan   
p25012
aVi said 
p25013
aV you should not try to beat pakistan 
p25014
aVyou should just learn to hit the ball 
p25015
aVthere is no pakistan in the ball  all right 
p25016
aVyou just have to hit the ball 
p25017
aVyou don t have to beat pakistan 
p25018
aVif you try to beat pakistan with your stupid emotions 
p25019
aVyou will do something stupid 
p25020
aVwhich has been happening continuously 
p25021
ag24670
aVi think recently virat kohli came on the television and said 
p25022
aV my only problem is i get angry 
p25023
aVi want to be like a monk  something he said 
p25024
aVwhatever his own version of being
p25025
aVwanting to calm 
p25026
aVi think he needs balance 
p25027
aVwith the kind of talent he has 
p25028
aVif he learns to become balanced 
p25029
aVhe is going to be a phenomena 
p25030
aVhe s going to be a
p25031
aVa new cricketing story on the planet 
p25032
aVnot just one more player 
p25033
aVhe has the necessary ingredients 
p25034
aVi said this when he was seventeen 
p25035
aVi saw him playing in singapore
p25036
aVfor the under eighteen team or something 
p25037
aVhe was captaining that team at that time 
p25038
aVi saw this boy playing and then only i said 
p25039
aV this guy will go far 
p25040
aVand then he vanished out of my radar for almost five  six years
p25041
aVand then he surfaced suddenly one day in the test 
p25042
aVin the indian team
p25043
aVand now he s going the way he s going 
p25044
aVhe needs to balance himself 
p25045
aVif he learns to be a cool fire 
p25046
aVnot a fire that burns him up 
p25047
aVthen he will do things which probably has not been done for a long time 
p25048
aVi think we can give him those tools of self transformation
p25049
aVwhich will not take away the fire 
p25050
aVsee  there are two ways to fire yourself 
p25051
aVif i get angry i can propel myself
p25052
aVthis is one way 
p25053
aVbut all of you know
p25054
aVwhenever you re angry it propels you 
p25055
aVat the same time 
p25056
aVit takes away your sense in many ways 
p25057
aVit takes away your capabilities 
p25058
aVwe can show you scientifically
p25059
aVmedically  we can show you
p25060
aVhow your system is getting poisoned when you are angry 
p25061
aVinstead of being that way 
p25062
aVwith sheer pleasantness you can drive yourself 
p25063
aVyou do not know how to
p25064
aVsee  there is  there 
p25065
aVwe have been driving internal combustion engines for a long time
p25066
aVwhich have been smoking and polluting and killing us
p25067
aVin many ways but they ve been propelling us 
p25068
aVnow  we are coming to engines 
p25069
aVwhich has no internal combustion
p25070
aVwhich smoothly drives
p25071
aVwithout a noise 
p25072
aVwithout smoke 
p25073
aVwithout nothing
p25074
aVwe re just coming to that 
p25075
aVwe re just coming of age with automobiles 
p25076
aVsimilarly  it's time humanity comes of age that
p25077
aVyou learn to propel yourself
p25078
aVin a very pleasant manner 
p25079
aVi am also on twenty hours a day 
p25080
aVi m just fooling around   
p25081
aVwhy do you need anger and this and that 
p25082
aVif out of sense  you can drive yourself 
p25083
aVit is not necessary you have to drive yourself with anger or hatred 
p25084
ag24810
aVthose things give you energy in a certain way 
p25085
aVbut they take away your competence in many levels 
p25086
aVthis boy needs tools for self transformation 
p25087
aVi think we should deliver that to him  
p25088
aVi would like to do that to him
p25089
aVbecause he is a phenomena in waiting 
p25090
aV yes  yes 
p25091
aVif already not made
p25092
aVi mean he can be a much bigger phenomena
p25093
aVbut he s already a phenomena not in the making
p25094
aV see  a one season phenomena will be forgotten 
p25095
aV forgotten 
p25096
aV he needs to become a
p25097
ag24549
aV in cricket you deal with lots of celebrities 
p25098
aVlots of kids who over a period of time become celebrities
p25099
aVand develop huge egos 
p25100
aVand when you see the game from within 
p25101
aVyou see how large the egos are
p25102
aVand to the outside 
p25103
aVthe ego doesn t overtake the interests of the team
p25104
aVbut sometimes it does 
p25105
aVhow does one  as an owner 
p25106
aVdraw a line between balancing the ego
p25107
aVand the interest of the team 
p25108
aVso  if you
p25109
aVif you were to pull up a celebrity 
p25110
aVhe s not used to it 
p25111
aVhe sulks  
p25112
aVthen your team loses out 
p25113
aVif you don t 
p25114
aVbecause of his ego 
p25115
aVsometimes wrong decisions are taken 
p25116
aVso  how does one balance this 
p25117
aV this is not just in cricket 
p25118
aVthis is everywhere  
p25119
aV absolutely 
p25120
aV you give somebody to do something 
p25121
aVif they do it for three days 
p25122
aVthey have reached stratosphere   you know 
p25123
aVif they do something  get little recognition 
p25124
aVif five people clap their hands 
p25125
aVthey will rise 
p25126
aVso till they fall  they don t realize
p25127
aVthis is not the way to play cricket  
p25128
aVup in the air you can't play cricket 
p25129
aVyou got to be on the ground 
p25130
aVso  how to deal with it 
p25131
aVthere are many ways
p25132
aVbut the best way is not that we don t deal with it 
p25133
aVwhen we  when i say we don t deal with it 
p25134
aVthey need tools for self transformation 
p25135
aVwhat has happened with them is just this  
p25136
aVthey are still driving themselves
p25137
aVbecause of the euphoria of the crowds 
p25138
aVwhat is written in the newspaper 
p25139
aVwhat other people are saying about you 
p25140
aVor in other words 
p25141
aVyou have not found anything about yourself  
p25142
aVyou are a product of other people s opinion 
p25143
aVeverybody is saying you re great
p25144
aVand you start believing you re great 
p25145
ag24469
aVyou don t have to believe anything 
p25146
aVif you re good at something 
p25147
aVyou just have to keep on seeing how to enhance that 
p25148
aVit is
p25149
aVthis is the problem with people  
p25150
aVthey think
p25151
aVthey become ambitious 
p25152
aVambition means you re tweaking your desire 
p25153
aVinstead of tweaking your competence 
p25154
aVyou re tweaking your desire 
p25155
aVwhich is just the wrong way to do life 
p25156
aVyou don t need to be ambitious 
p25157
aVyou don t need to think  i have to score hundred runs 
p25158
aVyou don t need to think  i have to become a champion 
p25159
aVyou just have to hit the ball that s coming at you right now 
p25160
aVthat s all you need to do 
p25161
aVfor this 
p25162
aVyou of course need training   that s a different aspect 
p25163
aVwithout that you wouldn t have come here 
p25164
aVyou just need the necessary alertness and presence of mind
p25165
aVto do what you have to do at that moment 
p25166
aVinstead of that  they ve become stars 
p25167
aVyour reputation will not play 
p25168
aVit's only which
p25169
aVyour competence which plays  
p25170
aVyour reputation cannot play 
p25171
aVso  by the time they realize this 
p25172
aVmany of them are flushed down
p25173
aVbecause there is a younger crop coming up doing things 
p25174
aVi think these boys 
p25175
aVyou know  because without other exposure 
p25176
aVwithout  generally with education they re just coming straight into the game
p25177
aVand they fully give themselves to the game 
p25178
aVbefore they know what's happening 
p25179
aVthey re quite lost   many of them 
p25180
aVnot all of them 
p25181
aVmany have matured with the game 
p25182
aVothers have gotten lost with the game 
p25183
aVif they are given little education about how to handle themselves 
p25184
aVi think they ll come out on the tops 
p25185
aV greed
p25186
aVi don t know how to define greed
p25187
aVbut i would 
p25188
aVin my own silly  stupid way i would define greed as
p25189
aVunlimited  irrational desire 
p25190
ag24842
aVgenerally greed is like this  
p25191
aVwhat i want is need 
p25192
aVwhat you want is greed  
p25193
aVgenerally  that s how it is defined  
p25194
aVgreed is a strong word 
p25195
aVwe don t have to go to this 
p25196
aVwhy
p25197
aVgreed is a consequence of a certain unfulfilled state 
p25198
aVwhen i say a consequence of a certain unfulfilled state  
p25199
aVwhat is a human being longing for  every human being 
p25200
aVall of you 
p25201
aVwherever you are right now 
p25202
aVyou would like to be little more than what you are right now 
p25203
aVisn't it so 
p25204
ag24571
ag24568
ag24568
aVif that little more happens  what 
p25205
aV little more 
p25206
ag25206
aVif that happens  what 
p25207
ag25206
aV so  it looks like 
p25208
aVin installments  you re going towards something 
p25209
aVhow much more would settle you for good 
p25210
aVlet's look at it right now 
p25211
aVwhy go at it in installments 
p25212
aVhow much more would settle you 
p25213
ag24571
aVif i make you the king or queen of this solar system  
p25214
aVdon t look at me with hope  
p25215
aVi ve not known to commit such blunders  
p25216
aVeven if you become the king or queen of this solar system 
p25217
aVyou will not be fulfilled 
p25218
aVyou will look at the stars
p25219
aVbecause this is the nature of the human being 
p25220
aVthere is something within you
p25221
aValways longing to expand in a boundless way 
p25222
aVbecause you have gotten so very identified with your physical form 
p25223
aVyou re trying to find this boundless way
p25224
aVthrough physical means 
p25225
aVwhen we say physical 
p25226
ag24493
aVphysicality can exist only because of a defined boundary 
p25227
aVif there is no boundary 
p25228
aVthere is no physicality possible 
p25229
aVyou can say something is physical
p25230
aVonly if it has a defined boundary 
p25231
aVotherwise it cannot be physical 
p25232
aVso  through something which is
p25233
aVphysical is the world of boundaries 
p25234
aVthrough the world of boundaries 
p25235
aVyou re trying to reach towards boundlessness 
p25236
aVthis is like you re driving your ambassador car  i
p25237
aVunfortunately  i don t see too many on the kolkata roads anymore 
p25238
aVyou re driving your ambassador car
p25239
aVbut you want to go to the moon 
p25240
aVyou may go beyond the moon sometimes  
p25241
aVif you try hard 
p25242
aVbut you will not go to the moon
p25243
aVbecause to go to the moon you need a different kind of vehicle  altogether 
p25244
aVso you re seeking boundlessness unconsciously 
p25245
aVso you re trying to go towards boundlessness through physical means 
p25246
aVwhen it finds very basic physical expression 
p25247
aVyou wanting to be more than yourself 
p25248
aVwe call this sexuality 
p25249
aVall you re trying to do is 
p25250
aVsomething that is not you 
p25251
aVyou re trying to make it a part of yourself for a few moments 
p25252
aVif it finds emotional expression 
p25253
aVwe call this love  
p25254
ag25251
aVyou want to include as a part of yourself 
p25255
aVif it finds a mental expression 
p25256
aVit gets labeled as greed 
p25257
aVambition 
p25258
aVconquest 
p25259
aVor simply shopping  
p25260
aVif it finds a conscious expression 
p25261
aVwe call this yoga 
p25262
aVyoga means union 
p25263
aVyoga means you successfully erased
p25264
aVthe boundaries of your individuality 
p25265
aVbecause the boundaries of your individual nature are essentially your making 
p25266
aVwhen i say it's essentially your making  
p25267
aVright now  let us say you re sitting here 
p25268
aVunfortunately 
p25269
aVsomebody that you don t like 
p25270
aVyour enemy  happened to settle down in the chair next to you
p25271
aVor in front of you 
p25272
aVyou can't stand them 
p25273
aVyou re sweating sitting there
p25274
aVbecause this horrible person is sitting next to you 
p25275
aVwhat usha 
p25276
aVno  no  no  
p25277
aVyour mind cannot take it 
p25278
aVbut your body has no issue 
p25279
aVwhat they exhale you re inhaling unconsciously but no problem  
p25280
ag24549
aVyes or no 
p25281
aVyour body has no problem 
p25282
aVthis life has no problem 
p25283
aVonly your mind has problem
p25284
aVbecause your mind recognizes the boundary 
p25285
aVyour body doesn t recognize the boundary 
p25286
aVyou sit here and breathe  
p25287
aVwhat you exhale  the trees are inhaling 
p25288
aVwhat the trees exhale  you re inhaling 
p25289
aVreally if you look at it 
p25290
aVone half of your lungs is hanging out there  
p25291
ag24810
aVyour life is not happening separately 
p25292
aVit is happening as a one whole thing 
p25293
aVyou re just a pop up from this planet  you know 
p25294
aVyou have seen those pop ups on your screen 
p25295
aVon your computer screen  
p25296
aVif they ve paid only for two seconds ad 
p25297
aVit just pops up for two seconds and pup 
p25298
aVin the life of this planet 
p25299
aVyou re just a two second pop up
p25300
aVand you will pop out 
p25301
ag25281
ag24568
aV so 
p25302
aVthis pop up doesn t understand it's just a pop up 
p25303
aVit thinks it s eternal 
p25304
aVits boundaries are eternal 
p25305
aVyou must get this now  
p25306
aVthese boundaries are all made by you 
p25307
aVif you really fix the boundary
p25308
aVyou can't breathe and you will die right now 
p25309
aVit is a transaction which is keeping you alive 
p25310
aVso this sense of boundary 
p25311
aVis wanting you to expand 
p25312
aVbecause you know only physicality 
p25313
aVyou re trying to expand physically 
p25314
aVif somebody expands faster than you 
p25315
aVyou say he is greedy 
p25316
aVif they
p25317
aVif you are expanding faster than somebody 
p25318
aVthen you think you are successful  
p25319
aV what stimulates or motivates a leader 
p25320
aVyou ve got there 
p25321
aVa mahendra singh dhoni is there 
p25322
aVright at the top 
p25323
aVwhat motivates them to achieve more 
p25324
aV you re essentially asking what drives them 
p25325
ag24568
aV if they re driven by something 
p25326
aVthey shouldn t be leading anything in my opinion 
p25327
aVwhen you drive 
p25328
aVyou re not driven 
p25329
aVyou are driving 
p25330
aVthen you re a leader 
p25331
aVif you re driven by something 
p25332
aVthen you re also a slave
p25333
aVbut you have a bunch of slaves behind you 
p25334
aVwhether your ambition drives you 
p25335
aVor your god given mission drives you 
p25336
aVor your greed drives you 
p25337
aVor whatever drives you 
p25338
aVif something is driving you 
p25339
aVin my opinion 
p25340
aVi wouldn t call that person a leader 
p25341
aVnothing drives you 
p25342
aVi m made like this 
p25343
aVi really have no need for action 
p25344
aVif i close my eyes and sit here 
p25345
aVi can sit here till i fall dead 
p25346
aVreally 
p25347
aVi can simply sit 
p25348
aVi ve simply no need for action 
p25349
aVbut all the time i m on 
p25350
aVpeople think i have a mission 
p25351
ag24529
aVi see an enormous longing in people around me 
p25352
aVi see it's needed 
p25353
aVso i do what i can do 
p25354
aVpeople call this all kinds of things 
p25355
aV oh  sadhguru is twenty hours a day 
p25356
aVseven days 
p25357
aVhow can he do this 
p25358
aVhe must be having god talking to him every day  
p25359
ag24469
aVthis is just this  
p25360
aVif you just pay attention to this  
p25361
aVevery human being is capable of knowing this  
p25362
aVthe very body that you carry 
p25363
aVyou created from inside 
p25364
aVthere is an intelligence here  
p25365
aVthere is a competence here  
p25366
aVwhich is capable of transforming a piece of bread into a complex machine called human mechanism 
p25367
aVthis  is the most complex piece of technology on the planet 
p25368
aVyou agree with me 
p25369
ag24568
aV those of you who re engrossed with your phones  i m asking you  
p25370
aVthis is the most complex piece of technology 
p25371
aVthis  you re capable of making
p25372
aVwith a piece of bread  or a mango  or a fish  or whatever you eat 
p25373
aVnow  if you can tap into this intelligence 
p25374
aVeven if a drop of this intelligence 
p25375
aVwhich can make bread into body 
p25376
aVcame into conscious access 
p25377
aVsuddenly life would become magical 
p25378
aVthis is what every human being has to do
p25379
aVbecause the highest form of intelligence is right here 
p25380
aVnot here   
p25381
aVit's right across 
p25382
aVright now we re mistaking intellect for intelligence 
p25383
aVintellect is like a knife 
p25384
aVit cuts through a few things 
p25385
aVit helps you with survival
p25386
aVbut it doesn t show you the nature of life 
p25387
aVit doesn t give you access to life 
p25388
aVin fact  it chops off everything 
p25389
aVif you apply your intellect too much to anything and everything 
p25390
aVeverything gets chopped up 
p25391
aVit's  it's a good instrument for dissection
p25392
aVwhen you want to know something 
p25393
aVso  
p25394
aVour
p25395
aVtoday our science has entirely become dissection 
p25396
aVthis works okay when you re doing some material stuff 
p25397
aVbut now  you want to know your mother very well 
p25398
aVso you dissect her 
p25399
ag24469
aVi m
p25400
aVplease  this is not the way 
p25401
aVokay 
p25402
aVthis is not the way 
p25403
aVyou must keep your instrument of dissection aside
p25404
aVand see how to embrace and include somebody 
p25405
aVonly then you know them 
p25406
aVby dissection you may see their liver  kidney  spleen
p25407
aVbut you won't know that piece of life in any context  isn't it 
p25408
aVso the problem is just this  
p25409
aVthat 
p25410
aVwe think a leader means he must be boom boom 
p25411
aVslogan shouting 
p25412
aVfired up 
p25413
ag24469
aVi think leadership has to mature into a place
p25414
aVa leader must be someone
p25415
aVwho has transcended his own needs 
p25416
aVthere is nothing driving him 
p25417
aVthen he will do what is needed 
p25418
aVthis is what i m trying to create with every human being in the world  
p25419
aVthat is 
p25420
aVyou re no more in pursuit of happiness 
p25421
aVyou re blissed out by your own nature  
p25422
aVwhen you re not in pursuit of happiness 
p25423
aVyou re no more a vested interest in the world 
p25424
aVyou will do what is needed 
p25425
aVbut when you re in pursuit of happiness  
p25426
aV if i do this i will find happiness 
p25427
aVif i do that i will get fulfillment 
p25428
aVor if i get this i will get fulfillment   
p25429
aVwhen you re in such a state 
p25430
aVknowingly or unknowingly 
p25431
aVyou re a vested interest 
p25432
ag25431
aVyou will cause much harm 
p25433
aVpeople may not realize that right now 
p25434
aVgenerations later people will look back and say 
p25435
aV look at the things they did in the past 
p25436
aVbut if you re joyful and blissful by your own nature 
p25437
aVyour intelligence will function in a completely different way 
p25438
aVyou will do just what is needed 
p25439
aVanother thing is
p25440
aVyou are free from the fear of suffering 
p25441
aVonly and only when you re free of fear of suffering 
p25442
aVwill you stride full stride in your life 
p25443
aVotherwise 
p25444
aVevery step is a half a step  
p25445
aV what will happen 
p25446
aVwhat will happen 
p25447
ag25447
aV whatever happens  this is how i will be   
p25448
aVif this assurance comes to you 
p25449
aVthen you would explore your life in many  many ways
p25450
aVthan you are doing  right now  isn't it 
p25451
aVthis one thing must happen for every leader 
p25452
aVthis is the reason why last twenty years we ve been focusing on the leadership in the world  
p25453
aVpolitical 
p25454
aVbusiness 
p25455
aVbureaucratic leadership 
p25456
aVall kinds 
p25457
aVthis is about twelve  thirteen years ago
p25458
aVsomeone very prominent person came to the yoga center
p25459
aVand they went through the inner engineering program
p25460
aVand they said 
p25461
aV sadhguru  this is fantastic 
p25462
aVbut what about the nation 
p25463
aVso i told them 
p25464
aV see  i have a clear cut plan 
p25465
aVi have listed out 2000 people 
p25466
aVi m not talking about prime ministers 
p25467
aVchief ministers because they come and go 
p25468
aVyou know  the life of a democratic leader may be five years or ten years at the most 
p25469
aVsome may last a little longer 
p25470
aVbut generally that s all it is 
p25471
aVbut there are another set of leaders  
p25472
aVbusiness leaders 
p25473
aVbureaucratic leaders 
p25474
aVsocial leaders
p25475
aVwho are there for a solid twenty five   thirty year span 
p25476
aVin many ways 
p25477
aVthese are the people 
p25478
aVwho ultimately are the legs for any political leadership 
p25479
aVthey are the people who actually deliver the goods 
p25480
ag24984
aV see  i have a list of 2000 people 
p25481
aVyou get me these 2000 people in the next four years 
p25482
aVyou will see in the next eight to ten years
p25483
aVyou will see a significant transformation in the country 
p25484
aVwe ve been going at it 
p25485
aVnearly fourteen  fifteen years i think now 
p25486
aVi think we have touched about forty two to forty three percent of this leadership
p25487
aVand they re making a quiet difference  
p25488
aVi m here with you for the same purpose  
p25489
aV but sadhguru  tell me one thing
p25490
aVone of my closest friend s wife had a very bad back problem
p25491
aVand now she is doing yoga 
p25492
aVand it seems she will be able to avoid surgery 
p25493
aVand she will get cured hopefully by yoga 
p25494
aVhow do we take this science 
p25495
aVwhich energizes the body 
p25496
aVto the youth of the country 
p25497
aV the youth of any nation has some level of volatility
p25498
aVand some level of confusion 
p25499
aVbut right now
p25500
aVthe youth in india in many ways are at crossroads 
p25501
aVthey do not know culturally
p25502
aVwhether they want to fall this way or that way 
p25503
aVusha has successfully you know 
p25504
aVstraddled the two worlds 
p25505
aVlook at her how she looks 
p25506
aVbut she s a rock singer  okay  
p25507
aVso others are all struggling how to
p25508
aVyou know 
p25509
aVthey don t know whether to get totally westernized or stay indian 
p25510
aVsomebody says bharat 
p25511
aVsomebody says india  you know 
p25512
aVit's a confusion for the youth 
p25513
aVthe  youth means it is humanity in the making 
p25514
aVand terrible things have been happening in the country 
p25515
aVin our country so many things are happening 
p25516
aVin this 
p25517
aVwhat is happening to children and youth is of great concern
p25518
aVbecause it seems in the last one year 
p25519
aV1700 children
p25520
aVbelow sixteen years of age committed suicide in this country 
p25521
aVwhen children start committing suicide 
p25522
aVwe need to understand
p25523
aVwe re doing something fundamentally wrong 
p25524
aVsomething very fundamentally wrong 
p25525
aVwhen children below sixteen years of age commit suicide in such numbers
p25526
aVwe need to understand 
p25527
aVwith grave concern 
p25528
aVthat fundamentals are not being handled properly 
p25529
aVi heard this number about four months ago 
p25530
aVthen i told our people
p25531
aVthis year for the yoga day
p25532
aVwe must touch 10 000 schools 
p25533
aVwe must teach yoga in 10 000 schools 
p25534
aVpeople balked 
p25535
aVbut they ve gotten used to it this  these days  
p25536
aVmy aspirations 
p25537
aV10 000 looked like a bi  big number four months ago 
p25538
aVthen i just traveled eight states
p25539
aVand met the chief ministers of every state
p25540
aVbut all of them came with such enthusiasm
p25541
aVthat today we have made mous 
p25542
aVwith these eight states
p25543
aVand the ninth state is coming through now 
p25544
aVit is going to cross 30 000 schools  
p25545
aVwe
p25546
aVwe have trained 45 600 teachers
p25547
aVwho in turn will train three teachers in every school
p25548
aVand this is not a one day thing 
p25549
aVthis is
p25550
aVwill happen as a part of the school curriculum 
p25551
aVjust twenty minutes a day 
p25552
aVa simple form of what is called as upa yoga 
p25553
aVupa yoga means it s sub yoga 
p25554
aVif you teach yoga 
p25555
aVthere are certain parameters that you must maintain
p25556
aVbecause it doesn t matter how innocuous a yogic practice looks 
p25557
aVevery one of them has a spiritual dimension to it 
p25558
aVsimply the way you sit 
p25559
aVthe way you breathe  it has 
p25560
aVwithout those dimensions  if you teach 
p25561
aVit would be irresponsible 
p25562
aVso we took this upa yoga and
p25563
aVwhich doesn t have a spiritual side to it 
p25564
aVwhich is purely for their physical and psychological well being 
p25565
aVit is of immense need in the country 
p25566
aVwe are probably touching somewhere around seventeen to eighteen million children
p25567
aVbetween ten to sixteen years of age 
p25568
aVthat s the age group we have chosen 
p25569
aVbut this is still a drop in the ocean 
p25570
aVthis is not a total solution 
p25571
aVthis needs to happen on a much larger scale 
p25572
aVmy commitment is
p25573
aVdid all of you brush your teeth today 
p25574
ag24568
aV those of you who re not saying anything  please 
p25575
ag24568
aV you brushed your teeth today
p25576
aVbecause the tools for keeping your dental hygiene are with you 
p25577
aVsuppose it was in the hands of the government
p25578
aVor with an organization 
p25579
aVthe toothbrush is in my hands 
p25580
aVyou have to come every day
p25581
aVand i will brush you  
p25582
aVi m sure many of you would miss it
p25583
aVbecause the queue  you know 
p25584
aVnow everybody has the tools of their dental hygiene 
p25585
aVsimilarly 
p25586
aVevery human being should have the tools of self transformation in their hands 
p25587
aVit should not be in the hands of a guru 
p25588
aVor an organization 
p25589
aVor some other kind of edifice
p25590
aVthat has been built  
p25591
aVevery human being must have access to this 
p25592
aVwith this intent we are doing many things 
p25593
aVfortunately 
p25594
aVi consider myself 
p25595
aVyou know  like 
p25596
aVi was speaking somewhere
p25597
aVand i said 
p25598
aV sadhguru  who is the greatest guru in the world 
p25599
aVi said   of course  me    
p25600
aVmike tyson s posture 
p25601
aV this is me  i m the greatest guru 
p25602
aVthey said 
p25603
aV what s happened to sadhguru 
p25604
aVi said see 
p25605
aVwhen a krishna came 
p25606
aVhowever graceful and fantastic he was 
p25607
aVif he spoke  the gentle being that he was 
p25608
aVif he spoke 
p25609
aVmaybe fifty people heard him 
p25610
aVthose behind did not hear 
p25611
aVwhen a gautama the buddha came 
p25612
aVhe was little more  you know 
p25613
aVhe didn t have the same aesthetic problems as krishna 
p25614
aVhe was more committed towards his mission  
p25615
aVso maybe he spoke little loudly 
p25616
aVhundred people heard 
p25617
aVtoday we have come to a world
p25618
aVwhere we can sit here and talk to a billion people if we want at once 
p25619
aVso when this kind of situation has come 
p25620
aVa time has come
p25621
aVwhere everybody should have access to it 
p25622
aVit should not be limited to organizations 
p25623
aVgurus

aVthis  that 
p25626
aVevery human being 
p25627
aVas they know how to keep their mouth clean 
p25628
aVthey must know how to keep themselves clean 
p25629
aVthe necessary tools must be made available 
p25630
aVour commitment is just to offer the tools 
p25631
aVno philosophies 
p25632
aVno belief systems 
p25633
aVno ideologies 
p25634
aVno forming of one more new religion 
p25635
aVbut every human being should have the tools
p25636
aVand they must know how to use it 
p25637
aVtoday it is possible 
p25638
aVnever before this was possible 
p25639
aVtoday it is possible  
p25640
aV very often a public display of simplicity is mistaken  for simplicity itself
p25641
aVand it's regarded as a virtue 
p25642
aVhow does one actually impress upon people
p25643
aVthat it is not a display of simplicity 
p25644
aVthat is important 
p25645
aVbut it is the simplicity of thought
p25646
aVand simplicity of virtue that is more important 
p25647
aV i would depreciate simplicity of thought 
p25648
aVi think we need a more sophisticated and complexity of thought 
p25649
aVwhy do we need simplicity of thought 
p25650
aVdo we want to become earthworms  
p25651
aVi know they re more eco friendly   but
p25652
aVthat s not the idea of being human 
p25653
aVthis entire simplicity business has come from very mediocre minds 
p25654
aVsaints and sages of the past  if you look at them 
p25655
aVthey lived in accordance to the times in which they lived 
p25656
aVsomeone   
p25657
aVi have
p25658
aVwhatever i do  i do it with a certain involvement and passion 
p25659
aVso i drive in a certain way 
p25660
aVso one journalist comes to me and asks 
p25661
aV yogis always walked across this country 
p25662
aVyou are driving by yourself 
p25663
aVwhat kind of a yogi are you   
p25664
ag25013
aV you idiot 
p25665
aVthousand years ago 
p25666
aVnot just yogis 
p25667
aVeverybody was walking only  
p25668
ag25667
aVeverybody was walking  
p25669
aVso he was also walking 
p25670
aVnow if i walk and go 
p25671
aVyou will say 
p25672
aV see  what a fool he is 
p25673
aVif i drive 
p25674
aVyou will say
p25675
aV see  he s driving 
p25676
aVwill i become more spiritual if i have
p25677
aVif i have a chauffeur driven car 
p25678
aVso right now  there is this thing
p25679
aVthat spirituality is some kind of a disability
p25680
aVbecause if you say spiritu   i m spiritual 
p25681
aVfirst thing they will ask you is what are the things you cannot do  
p25682
aVthey will not ask you what are the things you can do  
p25683
aVso  i took it upon myself
p25684
aVto confuse the hell out of people 
p25685
aVnobody can figure what i am 
p25686
aVi m many things at the same time 
p25687
aVi have driven in competitive racing 
p25688
ag25658
aVi m a licensed rotary wing pilot 
p25689
aVi m a licensed diver 
p25690
aVi m many  many things
p25691
aVbecause spirituality is empowerment 
p25692
aVit is not a disability 
p25693
aVthe reason
p25694
aVwhy most people have rejected spirituality is
p25695
aVbecause some people projected the idea
p25696
aVif you dress badly 
p25697
aVif you eat badly 
p25698
aVand if you live badly 
p25699
aVyou must be spiritual  
p25700
aVthis has to change 
p25701
ag25701
aVeverybody needs to understand
p25702
aVwhat you eat 
p25703
aVwhat you wear 
p25704
aVwhere you live is a question of your requirement
p25705
aVand your aesthetic 
p25706
aVhow you are within yourself is your spirituality 
p25707
aVinstead of fixing the interiority 
p25708
aVyou re fixing the  paraphernalia  you know 
p25709
aVyou re fixing your clothing 
p25710
aVso  if you just wear a small piece of cloth around your loins 
p25711
aVyou will not become spiritual 
p25712
aVif that is the like
p25713
aVthat is the way you like it 
p25714
aVyou want to keep your life that simple 
p25715
ag24722
aVbut unfortunately 
p25716
aVpeople are impressed by this 
p25717
aVno  this should go 
p25718
aVthis has to go 
p25719
aVso i think in many ways 
p25720
aVin a very controversial way i ve set up an example for this  that
p25721
aVyou know  donna  donna karan and me wanted to come out with a
p25722
aVi design clothes 
p25723
aVi
p25724
aVeverything that i wear is designed by me
p25725
aVand i also design for a few other people  
p25726
aVso i said
p25727
aVshe looked at my clothes and said 
p25728
aV sadhguru  you re the best dressed man in the world 
p25729
aVi said   no  no  no 
p25730
aVshe said   yes  really  i ve never seen anybody with your sense of color and texture and stuff 
p25731
aVwe must design clothes together 
p25732
aVi said   okay 
p25733
aVi ll give one week 
p25734
aVone week let's design something 
p25735
aV but  she said   i don t know how to design men s clothes 
p25736
aVi said   what's the problem 
p25737
aVi will design women s clothes  
p25738
aVthere is more options and more creativity there 
p25739
aVwell  i didn t get the time to do it but hope i ll do it someday  
p25740
aVso this idea of simplicity has destroyed many things 
p25741
aVat certain times  certain people
p25742
aVsomebody who lived in the jungle dressed in a certain way
p25743
aVbut even they  when they came to the city 
p25744
aVin those days  whatever was formal they wore those things 
p25745
aVpeople s idea of spirituality or yogis and saints 
p25746
aVi think these are yogis who have fallen out of the calendar images 
p25747
aVokay  
p25748
aV we re getting on in time 
p25749
aVthis can go on 
p25750
aVbut it's time to take questions from the audience 
p25751
aVwe will take two questions 
p25752
aV please take the microphone
p25753
aVif you raise your hand 
p25754
aVthe microphone will come to you 
p25755
ag24810
aV namaskaram sadhguru 
p25756
aVspeaking of gods and goddesses
p25757
aV i m sorry
p25758
aV speaking of gods and goddess 
p25759
aVkolkata is a place replete with kali and durga maa
p25760
aVcelebrating slain of mahishasur 
p25761
aVyou have also created mahishasur at linga bhairavi s feet 
p25762
aVwhat is the connection and spiritual significance of devi slaying the demon
p25763
aVand why under linga bhairavi also  thank you 
p25764
aV hey  we didn t talk about guts  gumption and gods 
p25765
aV we didn t 
p25766
aV she is bringing us to the gods 
p25767
ag24562
aV i want you to mentally gear yourself up for this 
p25768
aVi want you to understand this land 
p25769
aVthis culture is a godless culture 
p25770
aVnever before ever in this country
p25771
aVhave we projected the god any time 
p25772
aVwe always told you your life is your karma  
p25773
aVthat means your life is your making 
p25774
aVeverything that you are is a consequence of what you do to yourself
p25775
aVeither consciously or unconsciously 
p25776
aVif you do it consciously 
p25777
aVit ll turn out the way you want it 
p25778
aVif you do it unconsciously 
p25779
aVit ll turn out some other way
p25780
aVand you think something did it to you 
p25781
aVso  when we said it's your karma 
p25782
aVit meant that you are the maker of your life 
p25783
aVbut gods and gods and gods
p25784
aVi m sorry 
p25785
aVgoddesses also  
p25786
aVthere is a gender issue  
p25787
aVwe say that there are thirty three million gods and goddesses 
p25788
aVthis thirty three million happened
p25789
aVwhen our population was thirty three million 
p25790
aVsince then we ve gotten little shy of creating gods
p25791
aVbecause people from outside came without understanding
p25792
aVthe science and technology of god making 
p25793
aVthey said you are 
p25794
ag25509
aVmultiple gods you are worshipping 
p25795
aVthat s not how it is 
p25796
aVwe know there is only one god 
p25797
aVeverybody made up their gods 
p25798
aVsome have forgotten but we know 
p25799
aVthat s a big difference 
p25800
aVmaking up the god does not mean just imagine something 
p25801
aVthat is how it's happened in variety of cultures
p25802
aVbut in this culture we evolved the technology of god making 
p25803
aVwhen i say technology of god making 
p25804
aVi don t know if this word is alive in bengal 
p25805
aVbut in the south 
p25806
aVthe deity is also referred to as a yantra 
p25807
aVis that there 
p25808
ag24469
ag25281
aV yantra 
p25809
aV is the deity also referred to as a yantra 
p25810
aV well  in north india for sure 
p25811
aV it is 
p25812
ag25812
aV okay  in south  it's very much alive 
p25813
aVyou must understand  the word yantra means a machine
p25814
aVor a form that works for you 
p25815
aVwhy do we create machines 
p25816
aVwhy did we come up with a bicycle 
p25817
aVwe can walk 
p25818
aVbecause we are capable of locomotion 
p25819
aVwe walked for some time  
p25820
aVit was not good enough 
p25821
aVso we came up with a bicycle to enhance our ability to
p25822
aVour locomotive capabilities 
p25823
aVwe enhanced it further 
p25824
aVwe made it into a motorcycle 
p25825
aVwe made it into an airplane 
p25826
aVwe made it into many  many things 
p25827
aVall this  only because we are capable of locomotion 
p25828
aVif we were made like trees 
p25829
aVwe wouldn t have come up with bicycles 
p25830
aVright now because we can speak
p25831
aVwe have come up with a microphone 
p25832
aVwe have come up with a telephone 
p25833
aVwe have come up with all kinds of phones 
p25834
aVbecause we can see 
p25835
aVwe came up with a microscope 
p25836
aVa telescope and many kinds of scopes 
p25837
aVevery machine that we have created
p25838
aVis only enhancement of the faculty that we already have 
p25839
aVwe did not come up with any machine
p25840
aVwhich does something different from us 
p25841
aVit only does the same thing in a better way 
p25842
aVwe can t  see till there   
p25843
aVwe have a telescope and we can see very far 
p25844
aVwe can speak here but you wouldn t hear 
p25845
aVso we have a microphone 
p25846
aVnow we are speaking to the entire hall 
p25847
aVso everything 
p25848
aVevery machine is only an enhancement of our existing faculties 
p25849
aVsimilarly  as we have created machines 
p25850
aVwe created subjective machines 
p25851
aVthis is what we called as the deities or the murtis
p25852
aVor today being referred to as gods in english language 
p25853
aVthese are machines which could do something for us that we ourselves cannot do 
p25854
aVthere are any number of
p25855
aVinnumerable examples where people have used their deities or murtis or yantras in ways
p25856
aVwhich have made them into incredible human beings 
p25857
aVone which is right now circulating around the world because of this movie   what  
p25858
aVthe man who knew infinity  whatever 
p25859
aVramanujam you ve heard of  
p25860
aVramanujam just poured out mathematics 
p25861
aVunlearnt 
p25862
aVsimply poured out 
p25863
aVpeople asked him 
p25864
aV where does this come from 
p25865
aVhe says   my goddess  she just drops
p25866
aVshe just bleeds mathematics 
p25867
aVthe things that he wrote in early twentieth century
p25868
aVare still being figured today
p25869
aVand in 2010 they realized
p25870
aVsome of the formulas that he built are actually describing the black holes  
p25871
aVin early twentieth century 
p25872
aVthere was no concept of black hole
p25873
aVbut he created a mathematical backbone for black holes
p25874
aVwhich he did not know about 
p25875
aVnor did anybody know about 
p25876
aVhe said 
p25877
aV my goddess just pours mathematics for me 
p25878
aVso like this 
p25879
aVthese are subjective tools with which you can open up a certain window into existence 
p25880
aVi am a living example 
p25881
aVunlettered  
p25882
aVhappy being illiterate 
p25883
aVthe only qualification i have is 
p25884
aVwith great care i remained uneducated  
p25885
ag24810
aVno  no 
p25886
aVyou think education is a difficult thing 
p25887
ag24469
aVremaining uneducated takes a lot more
p25888
ag24876
aVfrom the first day you re born 
p25889
aVyour parents  every other adult  teachers 
p25890
aVpandits  priests  mullahs 
p25891
aVall kinds of people 
p25892
aVeverybody is busy teaching you something
p25893
aVthat has not worked in their life  
p25894
ag24810
aVif somebody gives you any advice 
p25895
aVfirst look at their face   
p25896
aVare they really more joyful than you  
p25897
aVwhy i m saying this is 
p25898
aVif something has worked for somebody 
p25899
aVit should have made him into a really exuberant life  isn't it 
p25900
aVsuppose somebody comes and gives you
p25901
aVyour neighbor comes and says
p25902
aV i have a special manure for your mango tree 
p25903
aVyou must look at his mango tree  
p25904
aVhow many fruits  
p25905
ag25281
aVbefore you apply that manure to your mango tree 
p25906
aVyou must see in his mango tree how many fruits are there 
p25907
aVif his mango tree is laden with fruit unlike yours 
p25908
aVthen yes 
p25909
aVyou must take his manure
p25910
aVotherwise you should not 
p25911
aVall the teachers 
p25912
aVincluding the parents 
p25913
aVi m asking you  between you and your children 
p25914
aVwho is more joyful 
p25915
aV children
p25916
aV then who should be a consultant for life  
p25917
aVso  these are tools 
p25918
aVwhen i referred to  you know 
p25919
aVif i 
p25920
aVwhenever i refer to dhyanalinga as a tool 
p25921
aVpeople get very upset 
p25922
aV sadhguru  it's more than our life 
p25923
aVdon t call it a tool 
p25924
aVit's such a mundane  crude word 
p25925
aVthen i tell them 
p25926
aV you do one thing 
p25927
aVyou come to the yoga center 
p25928
aVi ll give you plumbing job 
p25929
aVno tools 
p25930
aVyou can use your hands  your teeth  whatever you want 
p25931
aVthree days  work without spanners 
p25932
aVwinch   this  that  nothing  
p25933
aVeverything will be bleeding 
p25934
aVon the third day 
p25935
aVi will give you a spanner 
p25936
aVwill you worship the spanner or no   
p25937
aVyou do not know the power of the tool 
p25938
aVas human beings we are who we are
p25939
aVonly because of our ability to create and use tools  isn't it 
p25940
aVotherwise a colony of ants would dominate us 
p25941
aVbelieve me 
p25942
aVwe know how to use tools 
p25943
aVthat is what sets us apart 
p25944
aVso  we built subjective tools which 
p25945
aVtoday  are getting referred to as gods 
p25946
aVwe appropriately called them as yantras
p25947
aVbecause these are machines which work for us 
p25948
aVso for this  we had a certain way to operate a certain machine 
p25949
aVhow to access this particular machine   
p25950
aVa particular sound pattern 
p25951
aVa particular form 
p25952
aVa particular process 
p25953
aVthese processes unfortunately in many places might have gotten distorted 
p25954
aVbut if a deity is alive 
p25955
aVif you know how to use it 
p25956
aVit can do incredible things for you 
p25957
aVthis is not belief system 
p25958
aVthis is not religion 
p25959
aVthis is technology 
p25960
aVtechnology of another kind  
p25961
aV we have a question from ravichandran ashwin on video 
p25962
aVcan we take that 
p25963
ag24573
aVis he going to spin me out or what 
p25964
aV hello  sadhguru 
p25965
aVi m basically a very ambitious person in life 
p25966
aVanything that i want to do i
p25967
aVi think i should excel in it 
p25968
aVand hence what happens is 
p25969
aVi get into a lot of conflicts in terms of other people 
p25970
aVi generally try and shun people out of my life as much as possible  
p25971
aVwhen i seek excellence  there are always
p25972
aVthese obstacles that come in between 
p25973
aVbut what i want to understand is
p25974
aVthe disturbance that this creates as a process it puts in our mind  heart 
p25975
aVso i would like to handle it much better 
p25976
aVand if there is a way that we can sort this disturbance out 
p25977
aVi would like to know how 
p25978
aV if you want to excel in something 
p25979
aVas i earlier said 
p25980
aVyou think excellence also is your ambition 
p25981
ag25153
aVdesire need not be tweaked 
p25982
aVyour competence need to be tweaked 
p25983
aVtweaking the competence 
p25984
aVnobody can come in the way
p25985
aVbecause you re doing something with yourself 
p25986
aVwhen your competence reaches a certain level of excellence 
p25987
aVothers will stand by and watch anyway 
p25988
aVwhen you spin them out 
p25989
aVeven the batsman will stand and watch
p25990
aVhis wickets fall 
p25991
aVbecause there is a certain excellence 
p25992
aVso excellence is not something that you do with the world  
p25993
aVexcellence the  is something that you do with yourself 
p25994
aVsuppose you re managing large situations 
p25995
aVteams and organizations 
p25996
aVthen it involves everybody 
p25997
aVwhen it involves everybody 
p25998
aVthere is a certain aspect 
p25999
aVsee  the problem is 
p26000
aVwe are always either looking up to something
p26001
aVor looking down on something 
p26002
aVthis is something we must understand 
p26003
aVthis is one thing all of you should do  
p26004
ag25420
aVdon t look up to anything 
p26005
aVdon t look down on anything 
p26006
aVif you just bring this
p26007
aVthis is not simple 
p26008
aVthis is not as simple as it sounds
p26009
aVbecause the moment you say something is good 
p26010
aVyou look up to it 
p26011
aVthe moment you say something is bad 
p26012
aVyou look down on it 
p26013
aVjust bring this equanimity in you  
p26014
aVyou don t look up to something 
p26015
aVyou don t look down on something 
p26016
aVyou look at everything just the way it is 
p26017
aVonly if you see life just the way it is 
p26018
aVcan you conduct it to the best of your ability 
p26019
aVif you think something is good 
p26020
aVit gets exaggerated in a positive way 
p26021
aVif you think something is bad 
p26022
aVit gets exaggerated in a negative way 
p26023
aVthe moment you exaggerate something in your mind 
p26024
aVyou re not seeing things the way they are 
p26025
aVonce you don t see things the way they are 
p26026
aVexcellence will be of another world 
p26027
aVit will  you will never touch it 
p26028
aVso people are not in the way of your excellence 
p26029
aVnobody is 
p26030

aVtoday  the problem that
p26079
aVi personally face and i feel
p26080
aVfeel so many people
p26081
aVi have done shambhavi 
p26082
aVnow the question is 
p26083
aVevery morning when i   rise 
p26084
aVit becomes a some kind of a challenge  you know 
p26085
aVwhether i do it or i don t do it 
p26086
aVexecution in our lives has become a challenge 
p26087
aVso  what is even  say 
p26088
aVyou re touching the 30 000 schools and the children 
p26089
aVwhat will ensure that what the tools are

aVthat gets followed up in their life 
p26092
aVhow
p26093
aVhow does the execution part gets taken care of 
p26094
aVthat s my question 
p26095
aV  now  with the children 
p26096
aVwith the schoolchildren  it's
p26097
aVwe are not teaching it to the children 
p26098
aVwe are teaching it to the teachers
p26099
aVand it is going to become a part of their curriculum 
p26100
aVso they will do it anyway 
p26101
aVat least the five days in the school  it will happen 
p26102
aVthe other two days we don t know 
p26103
aVwe are trying to involve the parents 
p26104
aVif that happens  it ll happen at home also 
p26105
aVabout you  every day struggling whether to do shambhavi or not 
p26106
aVi want you to understand
p26107
aVi invested my life  and my time 
p26108
aVand my energy to make this happen for you 
p26109
aVand now if you re not doing it 
p26110
aVyou re not just wasting your life 
p26111
aVyou re trying to waste my life 
p26112
aVi don t  i take that very seriously 
p26113
aVand that s not a good karma for you  
p26114
aVso tomorrow morning  the thing is just this  
p26115
aVif those first six months we told you that you set it up  
p26116
aVthis discipline  
p26117
aVif you had done it  by now 
p26118
aVshambhavi would be a process that ll bliss you out every morning 
p26119
aVif something becomes a very sweet experience 
p26120
aVnobody has to tell you to do it 
p26121
aVit is only initially till you realize the nature of what it is 
p26122
aVyou need some  force 
p26123
aVso that s why we asked you to take a commitment 
p26124
aVi m sure you didn t keep it up 
p26125
aVbut now that you asked this question now 
p26126
aVnext six months you must do it  okay 
p26127
aVotherwise i m coming  
p26128
aVthere are millions of people for whom they are looking forward to their shambhavi
p26129
aVevery day
p26130
aVbecause that is the best twenty one minutes of their life 
p26131
aVit should become like that 
p26132
aVif something becomes beautiful 
p26133
aVthen nobody has to tell you 
p26134
aV you must do it 
p26135
aVanyway you will do it 
p26136
aVit will become lot more than
p26137
aVanything that you have known
p26138
aVif you give yourself to it 
p26139
aVthere are millions of people 
p26140
aVif they close their eyes in the morning 
p26141
aVtears of ecstasy are coming 
p26142
aVdo they need to determine themselves they must do it 
p26143
aVthey ll anyway do it 
p26144
aV friends 
p26145
aVi think in the interest of the schedule 
p26146
aVwe must call this to an end 
p26147
aV last question 
p26148
aVone 
p26149
aVone
p26150
aV i m okay  it s 
p26151
ag24573
aV hello  hello
p26152
aV somebody got the microphone 
p26153
aV pranam sadhguru 
p26154
aV can we take it from the lady there  then 
p26155
aV one question 
p26156
aV important question for me  please 
p26157
aVknowing who i am is not enough
p26158
aVbecause if you are
p26159
aV where are you 
p26160
aVwhere are you 
p26161
aV  if you
p26162
aV hello  
p26163
ag26161
aV sadhguru  here 
p26164
aV here means where  
p26165
aV balcony 
p26166
ag24409
aV i think
p26167
aV balcony  here 
p26168
aVi ve raised my hand 
p26169
aVyeah 
p26170
aVwhat my question is  
p26171
aVknowing oneself not intellectually but truly 
p26172
aVthe i am ness  being ness is still not enough
p26173
aVbecause the mind still traps you
p26174
aVand enslaves you 
p26175
aV no  you must ask the question
p26176
aV though the frequency
p26177
aV you must ask the question and leave it 
p26178
aVif you ask the question and also give your own answer 
p26179
aVwhat to do  
p26180
aV no  no  what i m saying is what to do 
p26181
aV what to do about what  
p26182
aV no  what i m saying is even if one knows oneself
p26183
aVas the being ness and i am ness not intellectually but truly 
p26184
aVstill it is not enough
p26185
aVbecause still the mind traps you
p26186
aVthough the frequency becomes less 
p26187
aVone more  another thing  
p26188
aVyou claim to stop people from getting enlightened
p26189
aVbecause they may die 
p26190
aVit is so ordinary and obvious thing to know oneself 
p26191
aVthen how  how can one die 
p26192
aVand how can one stop another person from getting enlightened 
p26193
aVthank you  sadhguru  
p26194
aV i don t need to stop you   
p26195
aVmost people are doing a good job with themselves 
p26196
aVi don t have to stop them 
p26197
aVit's only a few whose
p26198
aVyou must understand this 
p26199
aVthe problem is 
p26200
aVtoo many books are printed telling you all these things  
p26201
aVbeing ness and this ness and that ness  
p26202
aVtoo much jargon 
p26203
aVnothing happens like this 
p26204
aVyou must understand this  
p26205
aVif in some way 
p26206
aVany one aspect 
p26207
aVif something is happening which is genuine  
p26208
aVbecause your mind can deceive you in a million different ways  
p26209
aVif something genuine is happening 
p26210
aVat least one aspect of your physicality you will transcend 
p26211
aVthat is the test for you 
p26212
aVtonight just like that 
p26213
aVwithout drinking a mug of coffee or tea 
p26214
aVjust like that 
p26215
aVsimply without doing anything no party 
p26216
aVno nothing 
p26217
aVjust sit up and see if you can just stay awake 
p26218
aVjust like that  the entire night 
p26219
aVi m saying if something has happened within you 
p26220
aVat least one aspect of your physicality would be transcended 
p26221
aVit's not that forever you need not sleep 
p26222
aVjust try one night if it's possible 
p26223
aVso  just one
p26224
aVor try not going to the bathroom for twenty four hours  
p26225
aVanything  
p26226
aVtranscend something  let me see 
p26227
aVbecause if you have hit something beyond physical nature 
p26228
aVthis is a clear thing that happens to you 
p26229
aVmany things that you thought were impossible to go beyond 
p26230
aVsuddenly they are behind you 
p26231
aVcheck it out  
p26232
aV well friends 
p26233
aVi think all good things must end as must this 
p26234
aVfor me 
p26235
aVit's been not only a privilege but a blessing 
p26236
aVi think
p26237
aVthere is something to be learnt from every word that sadhguru says 
p26238
aVi think all of us are privileged 
p26239
aVhappy
p26240
aVand blessed 
p26241
aVthank you  sadhguruji  
p26242
aV i would  i would like to
p26243
aVi would like to use this opportunity to just say this   that 
p26244
aVit is  it is wonderful and truly heartening to see
p26245
aVthat across the world 
p26246
aVtoday the business leadership is beginning to look at the inner dimension 
p26247
aVnot entirely yet
p26248
aVbut they re beginning to  all over 
p26249
aVevery business school is interested  
p26250
aVthey
p26251
aVthey re trying to hire me as their professors 
p26252
aVas a professor for a week 
p26253
aVten days in a year which i m not able to do 
p26254
aVbut every top business school wants a spiritual element
p26255
aVwhich is a very good sign
p26256
aVbecause what spiritual process means is just this  
p26257
aVwhen your identification shifts beyond your physicality 
p26258
aVwhen your experience of life transcends physicality 
p26259
aVit is spiritual 
p26260
aVspiritual   it's the most malign word i know 
p26261
aVspirituality doesn t mean looking up  looking down 
p26262
aVit's about turning inward 
p26263
aVyou have touched something which is beyond physicality 
p26264
aVthe significance of this is just this  
p26265
aVif you touch something beyond physical nature 
p26266
aVthat means you have touched something which is boundless in nature 
p26267
aVyou ve
p26268
aVyou have left the world of boundaries behind you 
p26269
aVthat s what it means 
p26270
aVthose who are enabled
p26271
aVin terms of leadership  
p26272
aVeither political 
p26273
aVbureaucratic 
p26274
aVbusiness  whatever  
p26275
aVin whichever form  if you re in some state of leadership 
p26276
aVone thing that needs to happen is 
p26277
aVyou must evolve yourself beyond the world of boundaries 
p26278
aVif you live in the world of boundaries
p26279
aVand get hugely empowered 
p26280
aVyou re bound to create some kind of a conflict
p26281
aVwhich is destructive in nature 
p26282
aVparticularly the business leadership today
p26283
aVbecause there was a time
p26284
aVwhen the religious leadership on the planet
p26285
aVwas the most influential leadership
p26286
aVbut then the military machines on the world
p26287
aVin the world built up 
p26288
aVthen the military leaders became the most influential leaders 
p26289
aVbut in the last hundred years 
p26290
aVthe democratically elected leaders have become most powerful 
p26291
aVbut a time is coming 
p26292
aVin the next fifteen to twenty five years  
p26293
aVyou will see the economic or the business leaders
p26294
aVwill rule the world in many ways 
p26295
aVbut the business leaders 
p26296
aVunfortunately  have a tag around their neck
p26297
aVsaying that they are vested interests 
p26298
aVthey are here just to make money 
p26299
aVit is a time
p26300
aVit is a wonderful happening that
p26301
aVa whole lot of business leaders are looking towards spirituality 
p26302
aVthis means
p26303
aVspirituality does not mean going to the temple 
p26304
aVgoing to heaven 
p26305
ag24469
aVit means moving from a world 
p26306
aVor a dimension of boundaries 
p26307
aVto a dimension of boundlessness 
p26308
aVonce you re empowered 
p26309
aVit is important that you go beyond your boundaries 
p26310
aVyour boundaries should not rule you
p26311
aVand in the next twenty five years 
p26312
aVyou will see across the world 
p26313
aVthe business leadership will determine
p26314
aVwhat happens in this world 
p26315
aVtoday itself it is true 
p26316
aVthe success of a nation is not determined by the success of the military forces
p26317
aVor even the political process 
p26318
aVit is the success of the businesses of a nation
p26319
aVwhich determines the success of the nation
p26320
aVand the well being of the nation 
p26321
aVwhen such a responsibility has come 
p26322
ag25724
aVit is my aspiration to move every business leader
p26323
aVfrom personal ambition to a larger vision 
p26324
aVwhich brings well being to everyone 
p26325
aVthank you very much for sanjiv
p26326
aVfor being here on this day  
p26327
aV thank you

aS'the most important thing is'
p26527
aS"i don't esumanyi"
p26528
aS'you become a denansecer'
p26529
aS'only when you realize i do not know '
p26530
aS'those who do not realize'
p26531
aS'the immensity of i do not know'
p26532
aS'they will believe something '
p26533
aS'the moment you believe something'
p26534
aS'you get identified with it'

aS'the moment you get identified with it'
p26536
aS'your mind is a pliduticedmyle'
p26537
aS'it will only work around that'
p26538
aS'why is it so derficult'
p26539
aS'for human beings to '
p26540
aS"i don't know "
p26541
aS'facom the matter you know now'
p26542
aS'the elyoucimefrom'
p26543
aS'where you re going '
p26544
aS'is the ninterlishold existence '
p26545
aS"now isn't it"

aS'why can t i say i dont know'
p26547
aS'is it okay'
p26548
ag26525
ag2415
aS'is it all right'
p26549
aS'what i know i '
p26550
aS'what i do not know i do not '
p26551
ag26548
ag2415
aS'but right now the tendency in the world'
p26552
aS'the training in the world is'
p26553
aS'whatever you do not know you believe '
p26554
aS'belief needs simple '
p26555
aS'aesocian support '
p26556
aS'you just believe something'
p26557
aS'that nobody here endorses'
p26558
aS'you will not go '
p26559
aS'going looking for forming your own society'
p26560
aS'which believes what you believe '
p26561
aS'believe something and nobody else believes what you believe'
p26562
aS'so the youopladiculesasented'
p26563
aS'so you will always gathered numbers of our you'
p26564
aS'the moment you gather numbers'
p26565
aS'well '
p26566
aS'numbers are useful in a democratic process'
p26567
aS'but numbers are not useful in seeking'
p26568
aS'because a crowd cannot think '
p26569
aS'individual intelligence can seek'
p26570
aS'only the longing within an individual human being is capable of seeking '
p26571
aS'crowd cannot seek anything'
p26572
aS'so in many ways when you get identified with a particular belief system'
p26573
aS'you would have become a crowd '
p26574
aS'you are no more an individual'
p26575
aS'if you ask anybody they will '
p26576
aS'or a for example in com '
p26577
aS'he s wariincones'
p26578
aS'if it s a zonrabe'
p26579
aS'that i would be that is '
p26580
aS'so you have an athougiting it said it'
p26581
aS'because god is nasaiditifmuspetrue '
p26582
ag26346
aS'as he said '
p26583
aS"it doesn't matter who said it"
p26584
aS'the qushchin'
p26585
aS'is do you want authority to be the truth'
p26586
aS'or woywandertohtobethertonic'
p26587
aS'if you want to do to be the tartan '
p26588
aS'because that s the only thing that works'
p26589
aS'then we must come to this'
p26590
aS'much we must realize the immensity of i do not know'
p26591
aS'i do not know'
p26592
aS'is the basis of anowing'
p26593
aS'when you truly truly realize i do not know'
p26594
aS'wanting to know'
p26595
aS'longing to know'
p26596
aS'seeking to know'
p26597
aS'and the possibility of knowing becomes a living reality'
p26598
aS'otherwise you believe one thing'
p26599
aS'i believe one thing i '
p26600
aS'on one part '
p26601
aS'a man of the parking'

aS'not one'

aS'thousands of times wed be doing the same'

aS'so what you re asking is not about reinconnasion'
p26618
aS'and in a way'
p26619
aS'you re asking what happens beyond death'
p26620
aS'some things you know best only by epinins '

p26970
aS'which has been happening continuously now'
p26971
ag2415
aS'i think recently without only came on the television and said '
p26972
aS'only problem is i get angry'
p26973
aS'i want to be like a monk something he had '
p26974
aS'his own wosionof being '
p26975
aS'to come '
p26976
aS'i think he needs balance'
p26977
aS'with the kind of talent i has'
p26978
aS'if he learns to become balanced'
p26979
aS'he is going to be a phenomena'

aS'is going to be a '

aS'not this one mola'
p26983
aS'he has the necessary in god '
p26984
aS'i said this when i was seven '
p26985
aS'i saw him line and in a war '
p26986
aS'for the anderaiengtemor something i was '
p26987
aS'in the teartaotiei '
p26988
aS'this boy playing and then on the '

aS'and then i sufficesevenlyonedayinthedis'
p26992
aS'i i nameemdeed'
p26993
aS'and now he s going the way is on '
p26994
aS'needs to balance himself'
p26995
aS'if he learns to be a cool fire'
p26996
aS'not a fire that and him up'
p26997
aS'then he rildlings which probably has not been done for a long time'
p26998
aS'i think we can give him those tools of self transformation'
p26999
aS'which will not take away the fire'
p27000
aS'so that are two ways to fire yourself'
p27001
aS'if i get angry i can propel myself '

aS'the moment you say something is bad'
p27955
aS'look down on it'

p28259
aVand the most colorful incarnation
p28260
aVkrishna to contain him in these seven
p28261
aVdays is an impossible challenge at the
p28262
aVmost we can just have a glimpse who he
p28263
aVis and that glimpse should be more than
p28264
aVenough krishna is seen and perceived and
p28265
aVunderstood and experienced in many many
p28266
aVdifferent ways by different people
p28267
aVduryodhana through the eyes of
p28268

p28271

p28273
aVexisted many aspects of fogies will be
p28274
aVmissed so we will go into it but right
p28275
aVnow duryodhana is a man because of
p28276
aVcertain situations into which he was
p28277
aVplaced insecure angry jealous greedy and
p28278
aVfeeling wronged all his life and because
p28279
aVof actions which came forth from his
p28280
aVgreed and anger he became the key for
p28281
aVdestruction of his whole race in

p28283
aVhe's a smiling rogue if there was ever
p28284

p28294
aVwe don't say krishna vada we say radha
p28295
aVkrishna
p28296
aVshe has become a simple village woman
p28297
aVshe has become as significant as krishna
p28298
aVor little more significant than him she
p28299
aVsaid krishna is with me he is always
p28300
aVwith me wherever he is
p28301
aVwhoever he is with he's still with me
p28302
aVthat's her perception second in a

aVtortured human being because of a
p28304
aVcertain situation within himself right
p28305
aVfrom his child this is an absolutely
p28306
aVtortured soul
p28307
aV  chickened and said krishna never gave
p28308
aVme any hope but when he is there the
p28309
aVbreeze of hope touches everybody i can
p28310
aVgo on like this
p28311
aVdifferent people some of different
p28312
aVfacets of who he is for some he's god
p28313
aVfor some he's a crook for some he's a
p28314
aVlover for some he's a fighter of so many
p28315
aVthings he is if we want to taste an
p28316
aVessence of what it means when we say
p28317
aVkrishna the consciousness that we
p28318
aVreferred to as krishna if we have to be
p28319
aVtouched by this
p28320
aVwe need lila here we are for the lila
p28321
aVlila means it is the part of the playful
p28322
aVwe are not here just to play we are here
p28323
aVto explore the most profound and the
p28324
aVmost serious aspect of life but
p28325
aVplayfully conductor playfully in other
p28326
aVwords krishna won't be there if you want
p28327
aVto explore this path playfully if you
p28328
aVwant to be playful you need a heart full
p28329
aVof love a joyful mind and a wide body
p28330
aVotherwise there's no leader
p28331
aVyou sit there a loving heart a joyful
p28332
aVmind and a vibrant body do you have only
p28333
aVthen there is lila
p28334
aVthe brotherly love
p28335
aVif we want to experience the spirit of
p28336
aVcoca cola they should learn to look at
p28337
aVeach other with tremendous amount of
p28338
aVlove
p28339
aVwe should learn to walk to join our step
p28340
aVtill krishna was seven he was in this
p28341
aVplace called goofily this is his
p28342
aVchildhood joyfully very proudly he says
p28343
aVi stole butter
p28344
aVif i don't steal butter there would be
p28345
aVno zest in the village no excitement
p28346
aVi would hide behind a mother and make
p28347
aVloving eyes at them and they will smile
p28348
aVwhy krishna is such a huge factor in the
p28349
aVcultural ethos of this country is this
p28350
aVis a man who romped through his life no
p28351
aVmatter what was happening his life went
p28352
aVthrough various types of situations
p28353
aVright from his childhood many extreme
p28354
aVsituations but the most important factor
p28355
aVis he went through it like a dance
p28356
aVjoyfully blissfully lovingly wherever he
p28357
aVwants whether he's in a battle or just
p28358
aVabout to behead he's for there was a
p28359
aVsmile on his face
p28360
aVunfortunately people would like to see
p28361
aVthis as a divine quality smile is a
p28362
aVhuman quality it's not a divine quality
p28363
aVhuman beings who have lost it
p28364
aVhave transported their joy to heaven
p28365
aVthey have exported their joy's to heaven
p28366
aVonly there it's possible you know 24
p28367
aVhours being joyful being loving is not
p28368
aVout of reach for the human being and he
p28369
aVcouldn't believe why his mother is so
p28370
aVangry because normally he she gets angry
p28371
aVabout many things but if he smiles at
p28372
aVher if he makes simply okay but today
p28373
aVshe's not relenting she's continuously
p28374
aVangry she just tied him up to the
p28375
aVpounding wood he just dragged the
p28376
aVpounding wood a very heavy pounding wood
p28377
aVand dragged it on outside one younger
p28378
aVgirl and a little older girl came and
p28379
aVthey noticed krishna noticed the younger
p28380
aVgirl was lalita who was his playmate the
p28381
aV12 year old girl was a larger
p28382
aVradhe the moment she set her eyes upon
p28383
aVkrishna a seven year old boy from then
p28384
aVhe never went out of her eyes

aVthis is a bundle ultimate but it is a
p28389
aVroute of intimacy it is a prize
p28390
aVit's not exclude anything but where the
p28391
aVnature of the path is such that once a
p28392
aVperson steps into it everything else
p28393
aVjust disappears when rowdy was born and
p28394
aVshe was such a beautiful and lively girl
p28395
aVshe said the whole village aflame with
p28396
aVher life the fragrance of her

aVeffervescent nature she set the whole
p28398
aVvillage aflame and her maternal
p28399
aVgrandmother who was at foster mother was

aVso overjoyed by this girl she just
p28401
aVpicked up a cart wheel a heavy cart
p28402

aVthis family from bar sauna was to
p28406
aVmigrate to another place called rendang
p28407
aVhe told her i will come to win darwin
p28408
aVonce a person raises beyond certain
p28409
aVlimitations of his consciousness every
p28410
aVthought of his becomes the will of god
p28411
aVitself so whole gokula went to run
p28412

aVnot different people the same people at
p28421
aVdifferent times
p28422
aVsometimes this i am as a child sometimes
p28423
aVas a lover sometimes as god himself
p28424
aVso many old conventions were broken and
p28425
aVespecially the youth and children
p28426
aVenjoyed much more freedom than they'd
p28427
aVever enjoyed before these little boys
p28428
aVand girls went to bat at the same time
p28429
aVthe splashed water of each other and
p28430
aVthey played they looked at each other
p28431
aVthings were different on a certain
p28432
aVevening a full moon day these boys and
p28433
aVgirls gathered on the banks of river
p28434
aVyamuna and initially they started
p28435
aVplaying by throwing things at each other
p28436
aVhurling words in abuses and having fun
p28437
aVthrowing water throwing sand then after
p28438
aVsome time it broke into a dance and they
p28439
aVbegan to dance and they danced and
p28440
aVdanced and danced because they were in
p28441
aVsuch an exuberant and joyful state
p28442
aVand naturally they gathered around him
p28443
aVand he just went on almost half the
p28444
aVnight this is the time this is the first
p28445
aVincident of raasleela where a simple
p28446
aVjoyful mingling of people rose to a
p28447
aVtranscendental state so he always he
p28448
aVpresented himself in the best possible
p28449
aVway whether it was physical self for his
p28450
aVemotional self or mental self or
p28451
aVwhatever he always presented himself in
p28452
aVthe best possible way that he could this
p28453
aVis lau i want you to understand this if
p28454
aVyou really have love for life around you
p28455
aVyou will always see how to be at your
p28456
aVbest to everything around you if you
p28457
aVhave care and concern for life around
p28458
aVyou every moment you must be in the best
p28459
aVpossible way isn't it yes so krishna
p28460
aVexhibited this every moment of his life
p28461
aVso he never has a child walked out of
p28462
aVthe house without a peacock feather in
p28463
aVhis headdress
p28464
aVkrishna expressed to his mother that he
p28465
aVwants to marry rather his mother said
p28466
aVshe's not an appropriate girl for you
p28467
aVbecause she's five years older than you
p28468
aVand she's already betrothed to somebody
p28469
aVelse krishna said i don't know all these
p28470
aVthings of appropriateness from the
p28471
aVmoment she saw me she has allowed me and
p28472
aVshe has lived in me so i want to marry
p28473
aVthis girl this argument went on between
p28474
aVmother and son and mother had no words
p28475
aVto say so she they put to the father
p28476
aVthen nanda thought it's time to take him
p28477
aVto the guru so that let him speak so
p28478
aVgergich arya and his disciple who was to
p28479
aVbe krishna's teacher sandipani were
p28480
aVthere and they said your purpose of life
p28481
aVis different it has been prophesied that
p28482
aVyou are the deliverer you're the saviour
p28483
aVof dharma in this world krishna said
p28484
aVthat i don't wish to be a deliverer i
p28485
aVjust love the cows and the bulls and the
p28486
aVmen and the woman and the boys and the
p28487
aVgirls and the mountain and the trees
p28488
aVhere i don't wish to go and deliver
p28489
aVanything i just want to live here i'm in
p28490
aVlove with people i'm in love with things
p28491
aVaround here i just want to live here i
p28492
aVdon't want to save anybody i don't want
p28493
aVto deliver anybody i just want to live
p28494
aVhere then gergich area thought it's time
p28495
aVto reveal the truth about his birth
p28496
aVso gergich arya talked about the
p28497
aVprophecy that nara the money had made
p28498
aVand krishna is not nanda issue the son
p28499
aVfor the first time they revealed to him
p28500
aVthen gergich area said narada has
p28501
aVclearly identified you all the signs
p28502
aVindicated to you and you have exhibited
p28503
aVall the qualities that neither talked
p28504
aVabout everything is right you are that
p28505
aVperson that has been talked about by
p28506
aVmany sages
p28507
aVand nada has fixed the date time and
p28508
aVplace and you fit into all that it can't
p28509
aVbe wrong all this descended upon him
p28510
aVwith such force he just stood there
p28511
aVsilently and then slowly walk towards
p28512
aVmenthe go over them a hill like this he
p28513
aVjust walked up to the topmost point and
p28514
aVjust to there looking at the sky the sun
p28515
aVwas setting
p28516
aVlooking at the setting sun suddenly a
p28517
aVtremendous sense of empowerment went
p28518
aVthrough him
p28519
aVthis was his moment of enlightenment and
p28520
aVreminder he just stood there for many
p28521
aVhours realizing and experiencing so much
p28522
aVwithin himself when he walked down that
p28523
aVhill he was a completely different
p28524
aVperson altogether that playful cowboy
p28525
aVwas gone
p28526
aVsuddenly there was a new serenity about
p28527
aVhim there was a new sense of a
p28528
aVcompletely new sense of dignity and
p28529
aVdivinity about him when he walked down
p28530
aVall these days these people who just
p28531
aVplayed with him who enjoyed his dance
p28532
aVand music suddenly they began to bow
p28533
aVdown to him he did nothing he just went
p28534
aVup the mountain stood there for a few
p28535
aVhours and walked down suddenly anybody
p28536
aVwho saw him started bowing down to him
p28537
aVnot knowing what they're doing he knew
p28538
aVhe had to leave but before he left this
p28539
aVwas not a full moon the last full moon
p28540
aVrasa is over but he organized an
p28541
aVunscheduled rasa he wanted to just for
p28542
aVonce dance and sing with his people so
p28543
aVhe sang and danced and
p28544
aVeverybody knew his living rowdy just
p28545
aVworked herself into such a frenzy of
p28546
aVecstasy and bliss within herself it just
p28547
aVdidn't matter to her she just
p28548
aVtranscended the normal limitations of
p28549
aVemotion and became so ecstatic and
p28550
aVwild eyed that nothing mattered to her
p28551
aVso krishna went to hers he knew what it
p28552
aVmeans to her so he went to her held her
p28553
aVand he pulled out his flute from his
p28554
aVwaistband and gave it to her this flute
p28555
aVis only for you no more flute for me
p28556
aVnever again
p28557
aVhe played flute in his life he just gave
p28558
aVit to her
p28559
aVfrom that day onwards radha started
p28560
aVplaying flute like krishna krishna never
p28561
aVagain played the flute
p28562
aVwe'll start looking at another dimension
p28563
aVof krishna krishna as a teacher krishna
p28564
aVis an embodiment of the divine krishna
p28565
aVas an ultimate yogi so his whole
p28566
aVteaching has come down in the form of
p28567
aVgita so right now i will give you a gift
p28568
aVof gita you don't have to read it from
p28569
aVend to end you just read something here
p28570
aVand there so that at least you could ask
p28571
aVthe right kind of question and we could
p28572
aVexplore his teaching to some extent you
p28573
aVplease sir gita is not just a book it's
p28574
aVnot just somebody's works if you went
p28575
aVdeep into you deep enough into yourself
p28576
aVthis is what you would speak so krishna
p28577
aVdid not choose arjuna at last he found
p28578
aVone guy
p28579
aVwilling to sit through the whole 18
p28580
aVchapters that   he had to be driven to
p28581
aVdesperate moment in his life a few days
p28582
aVearlier even our journalism imminent
p28583
aVdeath and destruction then he listens
p28584
aVthere was never a time when i or you or
p28585
aVany of these kings here did not exist
p28586
aVand all of us shall certainly exist in
p28587
aVfuture   now he's talking about life in
p28588
aVit's essential quality not life as
p28589
aVpeople so the life in front of you you
p28590
aVcannot harm it you cannot obliterate it
p28591
aVdon't believe such things you cannot
p28592
aVreally obliterate life you are only
p28593
aVgoing to put an end to this person now
p28594
aVwho is standing in front of you but he
p28595
aVcontinues so do you it's always being
p28596
aVwhen we say whatever you consider is
p28597
aVdivine whatever is the source of
p28598
aVcreation must be eternal isn't even from
p28599
aVyour understanding okay you don't know
p28600
aVit i am saying even from your
p28601
aVunderstanding that which is the source
p28602
aVof creation must be eternal isn't it
p28603
aVcreation itself is not eternal it comes
p28604
aVand goes
p28605
aVbut that which is a source of creation
p28606
aVmust be eternal so in that context he is
p28607
aVsaying don't you worry your whole
p28608
aVbusiness is with the physical surface
p28609
aVwhether you live if you live joyfully
p28610
aVthis physical is meaningful once you
p28611
aVhave decided wherever you are put you're
p28612
aVonly going to make misery out of it you
p28613
aVwill make anger out of it hates it out
p28614
aVof it violence out of it it is all right
p28615
aVto obliterate the physical
p28616
aVbut the deeper dimension of who is
p28617
aVstanding in front of you cannot be
p28618
aVkilled they have always been they will
p28619
aValways be the same is true with you the
p28620
aVsame is true with them so do not lament
p28621
aVabout these things now a time has come
p28622
aVwhen in the physical plane of reality
p28623
aVyou have to take action destruction is
p28624
aVneeded this is why if he because he is
p28625
aVcoming from this experience
p28626
aVhe was pain and hurt when people were
p28627
aVpained he laughed with people he cried
p28628
aVwith people but now he turned himself to
p28629
aVa different gear now he's not standing
p28630
aVthere as another human being among human
p28631
aVbeings he is standing it standing there
p28632
aVas ultimate nature when he is standing
p28633
aVthere as a divine possibility now he
p28634
aVspeaks in a completely different tongue
p28635
aVthis same man krishna when he stood
p28636
aVthere as a human being just because a
p28637
aVman had six wells on his back he risked
p28638
aVhis life to nurse those six wells on
p28639
aVsomebody's back you know we were looking
p28640
aVat this in pune agenor ship but this
p28641
aVsame man now says you can slaughter this
p28642
aVhundred thousand people don't worry it
p28643
aVis just the body but he didn't say that
p28644
aVwhen that man was in pain with six wells
p28645
aVon his body you need to understand this
p28646
aVwhen he stood there as a human being he
p28647
aVwas a fantastic human being now he's
p28648
aVstanding here as a divine possibility
p28649
aVhe's no more concerned about the
p28650
aVphysical he is just talking about let's
p28651
aVmelt the pots
p28652
aVanyway they'll get reshaped again right
p28653
aVnow they're all cracked up no point
p28654
aVtrying to struggle with them let's melt
p28655
aVthe pots off they will anyway find their
p28656
aVway you cannot take away the source of
p28657
aVwho they are you can only take off the
p28658
aVsurface let's do it
p28659
aVcan you see the difference in the man he
p28660
aVsticks his life out just to nurse six
p28661
aVwounds and somebody's back now he's
p28662
aVwilling to take hundred thousand lives
p28663
aVwith a smile on his face so you have to
p28664
aVlook at the statement from whom it is
p28665
aVcoming now anybody can repeat these
p28666
aVwords probably somewhere else it says
p28667
aVit's alright to kill you cannot kill
p28668
aVanybody you can neither be killed nor
p28669
aVkill
p28670
aVso it's okay go ahead and slaughter
p28671
aVsomeone else who is not in this state
p28672
aVshould not speak these words this is why
p28673
aVi always tell people don't read the gita
p28674
aVbecause you will go according to your
p28675
aVlogical mind and it will be very
p28676
aVconvenient for all the pain and
p28677
aVsuffering that you heap upon other
p28678
aVpeople after all what is there nobody
p28679
aVdies and is he born it is okay this is
p28680
aVtrue only when it's true with you also
p28681
aVonly when it is true with you also
p28682
aVyou are also beyond pain you are also
p28683
aVbeyond suffering you are also beyond
p28684
aVlife and depth only then you say these
p28685
aVwords otherwise you don't parrot these
p28686
aVwords at all it's not for you to say
p28687
aVthis when it comes from krishna it is
p28688
aVgenuine and true if somebody else just
p28689
aVparrots these words it is utter
p28690
aVfalsehood
p28691
aVkrishna is supposed to be blue bodied
p28692
aVmaybe he was dark skinned but people who
p28693
aVare aware saw the blueness of his energy
p28694
aVso they went about describing him as
p28695
aVblue you will see in the existence
p28696
aVanything that is washed beyond your
p28697
aVperception generally tends to be blue
p28698
aVwhether it's the ocean or the sky these
p28699
aVare the two things which are not
p28700
aVperceivable in normal terms anything
p28701
aVwhich is larger than your perception
p28702
aVtends to be blue because it is the basis
p28703
aVof all inclusiveness today it's good
p28704
aVthat all of you have turned blue we will
p28705
aVgo through a certain process do we will
p28706
aVuse imagination but you need to
p28707
aVunderstand everything that man has
p28708
aVcreated has come from his imagination
p28709
aVhere we have the necessary energy to use
p28710
aVimagination and make it into an absolute
p28711
aVreality within ourselves so by the time
p28712
aVwe're done with this you must be shining
p28713
aVblue not just clothes blue
p28714
aVsounds of liars
p28715
aVsee
p28716
aVlet him become part of your blue in my
p28717
aVchoice has always been
p28718
aVoh
p28719
aVi'm lauren wow but no matter what i
p28720
aVstill my many countries up in many
p28721
aVsweets i've had many clothes i bought
p28722
aVbut no matter what i feel for my blue
p28723
aVsky
p28724
aVbecause of this blue nature people's
p28725
aVjust fell in love with him and both men
p28726
aVand women couldn't take it
p28727
aVno matter what
p28728
ag28719
aVnah
p28729
aVsuddenly something happened in i saw
p28730
aVwith bhisma whoever it is
p28731
aVeveryone in one it was positive for me
p28732
aVonly in the presence of
p28733
aVfingers i don't know whether she is a
p28734
aVmiracle not a miracle maker he is a
p28735
aVmiracle newsome don't miss the miracle
p28736
aVin you appreciating his sense and
p28737
aVintelligence and activity
p28738
aVdon't miss the miracle that's the most
p28739
aVsignificant aspect of him only because
p28740
aVhe is such a miracle that type of life
p28741
aVhe lives to be devotee is a very
p28742
aVintelligent way to live that means
p28743
aVyou're always overwhelmed with sweet
p28744
aVemotions is it not an intelligent way to
p28745
aVexist to keep yourself very sweet if you
p28746
aVare overwhelmed with sweet emotions your
p28747
aVphysical body in your mind and the world
p28748
aVaround you will function at its best for
p28749
aVyou your body will offer its best to it
p28750
aVbest to you your mind will offer its
p28751
aVbest to you the world will often its
p28752
aVbest to you and what's beyond also will
p28753
aVoffer its best to you so devotion versus
p28754
aVintelligence no devotion is very deep
p28755
aVintelligence
p28756
aVhave you just be here this place is
p28757
aVloaded this is not just simply a forest
p28758
aVof trees and animals this place is
p28759
aVloaded you don't have to imagine things
p28760
aVyou don't have to see things that you
p28761
aVdon't see just we here it has an impact
p28762
aVon it you don't have to hear or see
p28763
aVanything but your being will not go
p28764
aVuninfluenced if one can simply be this
p28765
aVart form that you will see now in many
p28766
aVways is the basis of the famous odyssey
p28767
aVdancing most odyssey dancers of any
p28768
aVcaliber in their early age have been
p28769
aVgood to us they called boricuas what it
p28770
aVwould be for means is a young boy below
p28771
aVhis puberty age will dress up like a
p28772
aVgirl and do the rus like krishna and
p28773
aVradha
p28774
aVthey're very good singers and incredible
p28775
aVdancers and this is also a way of
p28776
aVgetting into the guru shishya parampara
p28777
aVdisciplic one slide learning about the
p28778
aVvarious dimensions of his own inner
p28779
aVnature a person who goes through this
p28780
aVdiscipline for six to seven years
p28781
aVdefinitely turns out as a very balanced
p28782
aVsensible loving human being it's a very
p28783
aVdifferent way of transform
p28784
aVhuman being yesterday someone was asking
p28785
aVhow to practice love andrews
p28786
aVthese are very acrobatic devotees you
p28787
aVdon't have to be such an acrobat to be a
p28788
aVdevotee but you definitely need the
p28789
aVhumility of those little boys to be a
p28790
aVduty one who does not make himself
p28791
aVimportant is a devotee
p28792

aVfor thousands of years 
p29481
aVfor the longest period compared to anything on this planet 
p29482
aVthis wisdom 
p29483
aVthis dimension of knowing has lived on

aVwithout any kind of true organization
p29485
aVor a certain kind of leadership
p29486
aVor any other kind of organized support 
p29487
aVout of sheer efficacy of what it is 
p29488
aVit's just lived on 
p29489
aVa time has come in the world
p29490
aVwhen
p29491
aVwhere even truth has to be protected  
p29492
aVwhen we talk about east 
p29493
aVwe are not talking about a particular geography 
p29494
aVthis must be clearly understood  
p29495
aVwe are not talking about east and west
p29496
aVas geographical features in the world 
p29497
aVany number of great minds in america

p29504
aV every morning  i bathe my intellect
p29505
aVin this stupendous and cosmogono knowledge from the east 
p29506
aVin comparison 
p29507
aVall our modern world and literature is puny and trivial 
p29508
aVi think mark twain went out to
p29509
aVprobably gave out the best compliment to the east

p29518
aVany number of people have said many  many things 
p29519
aVwhy 
p29520
aVwhy is it important 
p29521
aVwhy is it important to preserve and nurture this dimension of life 
p29522
aVthe fundamental reason
p29523
aVwhy it seems to be so significantly different is
p29524
aVbecause it is not a product of human intellect 
p29525
aVit is not deductions that we made out of our intellect 
p29526
aVthis dimension comes from a profound inner experience 
p29527
aVwhere there is no right and wrong 
p29528
aVthere is no up and down 
p29529
aVjust seeing things the way they are 
p29530
aVand when we say dharma 
p29531
aVwe are not talking about a religion 
p29532
aVas modern translators went about interpreting dharma as
p29533
aVhindu dharma or whatever 
p29534
aVanother religion 
p29535
aVbecause they came from a mindset
p29536
aVthat everybody has to belong to some segment of humanity 
p29537
aVthey come from a mindset
p29538
aVwhere humanity has to be divided one way or the other
p29539
aVbecause they come from the surface intelligence of human nature
p29540
aVwhich we call as intellect 
p29541
aVunfortunately  the modern societies 
p29542
aVmodern education systems have entirely dedicated themselves
p29543
aVto the human intellect 
p29544
aVcompletely ignoring other dimensions of intelligence
p29545
aVwhich definitely exist within us 
p29546
aVwhen you go by the intellect 
p29547
aVthe nature of the intellect is always to dissect and divide
p29548
aVbecause intellect is essentially discriminatory in nature 
p29549
aVan intellect functions always with a certain identity 
p29550
aVif you have no identity 
p29551
aVyou cannot use your intellect 
p29552
aVso with individual identities 
p29553
aVeither of race  religion  nationality  caste  creed  gender 
p29554
aVwhen you apply your intellect 
p29555
aVit ll split the world into many pieces 
p29556
aVso the significance of what we are referring to as
p29557
aVthe spirit of eastern wisdom is
p29558
aVit does not come from human intellect 
p29559
aVit comes from a deeper dimension of intelligence within us 
p29560
aVwhen i say a deeper dimension of intelligence 
p29561
aVa simplistic way of looking at it would be
p29562
aVwhatever you had for lunch today 
p29563
aVif you had a piece of bread 
p29564
aVover the afternoon 
p29565
aVthis bread is being transformed into a human being 
p29566
aVyou definitely cannot do that with your intellect 
p29567
aVthere s an intelligence here  
p29568
aVwhich is capable of making a banana into a human being
p29569
ag29567
aVa dimension of intelligence which is beyond thought process
p29570
aVthought  or the product of intellect 
p29571
aVis essentially always functioning
p29572
aVfrom a limited amount of data that we have gathered 
p29573
aVnow  what we call as eastern wisdom
p29574
aVis not coming from a limited amount of data that we have gathered 
p29575
aVeither from the books or our life experience 
p29576
aVbut simply by enhancing our ability to perceive life
p29577
aVin ways that the five sense organs cannot function 
p29578
aVwhy i m talking about the five sense organs is 
p29579
aVall the data that you have ever gathered
p29580
aVwhich rests in so many aspects within you 
p29581
aVwhich is the food for the intellect 
p29582
aVcomes from the five sense organs 
p29583
aVin the very nature of things 
p29584
aVsense organs cannot perceive the entirety of anything 
p29585
aVif you can see this part of my hand  
p29586
aVyou cannot see this part of my hand  
p29587
aVthis is the nature of sense perception 
p29588
aVeven if you take a grain of sand 
p29589
aVif you see one part of it 
p29590
aVyou cannot see the other face of it 
p29591
aVsense organs can only perceive in comparison 
p29592
aVif there is no comparison 
p29593
aVyour senses are useless 
p29594
aVbecause there is darkness 
p29595
aVyou know what is light 
p29596
aVotherwise you just would not know what is light 
p29597
aVif light was on all the time and there was no darkness 
p29598
aVyou would not know what is light 
p29599
aVbecause there is silence  you know what is sound 
p29600
aVif there was no silence 
p29601
aVyou would not have the idea of what is sound 
p29602
aVso always in comparison
p29603
aVit is like
p29604
aVlet's say you re six feet tall 
p29605
aVnow  you walk like a tall man 
p29606
aVyou think like a tall man 
p29607
aVyou feel like a tall man 
p29608
aVyou are a tall man  
p29609
aVyou went to another society where everybody is eight feet tall  
p29610
aVsuddenly you walk like a short man 
p29611
aVthink like a short man 
p29612
aVfeel like a short man and you are a short man  
p29613
aVso what you perceive in comparison is a distortion of reality 
p29614
aVit is not reality as it is 
p29615
aVso whatever we perceive in comparison is useful for our survival process
p29616
aVbut if we want to know  know the nature of this existence 
p29617
aVsense organs are not sufficient instruments 
p29618
aVwhat is light for you is darkness for many other creatures 
p29619
aVyou ever got into an argument with an owl  
p29620
aVif you did  which is light  which is darkness 
p29621
aVwhere would it go  
p29622
aVit would be endless argument 
p29623
aVwho is right  you or the owl 
p29624
aVhmm 
p29625
aV both 
p29626
aV oh  if you re saying both   either you belong to the diplomatic corps 
p29627
aVor you have a successful marriage  
p29628
aVyou have learned to say   both  both  both  for everything  
p29629
aVyou re right 
p29630
aVwell  that is the basis of all the problems on the planet  
p29631
aV i m right and you are wrong   
p29632
aVthe fact of the matter is 
p29633
aVyou are perceiving it as it is necessary for your survival 
p29634
aVthe owl is perceiving it as it is necessary for his survival 
p29635
aVif survival is all you re seeking 
p29636
aVyour five sense organs and intellect are sufficient instruments 
p29637
aVbut if you want to know the nature of the existence 
p29638
aVif you want to know the fundamental laws or dharma which governs life 
p29639
aVthe way it happens within us and around us 
p29640
aVthen you need an inner perception
p29641
aVor another dimension of intelligence within you 
p29642
aVotherwise  you will only cut the world into pieces 
p29643
aVin the name of religions 
p29644
aVwe have cut the world into  humanity into many pieces
p29645
aVbecause intellectually we have arrived at our own
p29646
aVconclusions or deductions 
p29647
aVwhich invariably is bound to divide
p29648
aVbecause intellect is essentially a knife which cuts 
p29649
aVit can only dissect 
p29650
aVby dissection  you can know certain things 
p29651
aVbut if you really want to know someone that you love 
p29652
aVyou don t dissect them  you embrace them  
p29653
aVby dissection  you may know the kidney  liver  heart  stuff
p29654
aVbut you will not know that being in any sense 
p29655
aVyou will lose it completely 
p29656
aVso dissection is the way of the intellect
p29657
aVbecause it is a sharp instrument 
p29658
aVit has to cut it  cut open everything that s given to it 
p29659
aVbut the east found another way 
p29660
aVout of profoundness of experience  you can know life 
p29661
aVby turning inward  you can know life 
p29662
aVwhen i say turning inward 
p29663
aVyou must understand that essentially 
p29664
aVthe five sense organs are always outward 
p29665
aVyou can see what's around you
p29666
aVbut you cannot roll your eyeballs inward and scan yourself 
p29667
aVyou can hear this 
p29668
aVbut so much activity in this body 
p29669
aVyou cannot hear this 
p29670
aVif an ant crawls upon this hand  you can feel it 
p29671
aVso much blood flowing  you cannot feel it
p29672
aVbecause in the very nature of things
p29673
aVsense organs are outward bound 
p29674
aVthe moment you dedicate yourself to your intellect 
p29675
aVyou also get enslaved to the limitations of your five senses 
p29676
aVit is in this context 
p29677
aVthe wisdom of the east is of tremendous significance to the world
p29678
aVbecause it has transcended this slavery to sense perception
p29679
aVand learned to perceive life in a completely different way 
p29680
aVwhat is this completely different way 
p29681
aVin english language 
p29682
aVif you say mind  it is just one word 
p29683
aVit is supposed to say everything 
p29684
aVin the yogic culture 
p29685
aVthere are sixteen parts to the mind 
p29686
aVsixteen dimensions of human mind 
p29687
aVnow  if i go into sixteen  it would take too much time 
p29688
aVso let me compress it into four  
p29689
aVthe four aspects of the mind are called
p29690
aVbuddhi 
p29691
aVahankara 
p29692
aVmanas
p29693
aVand chitta 
p29694
aVbuddhi means the intellect 
p29695
aVtoday  modern world is largely run by the intellect 
p29696
aVso  with this  we can do many things on the outside 
p29697
aVwe can go on enhancing the comforts and conveniences of life 
p29698
aVwe ve done very well
p29699
aVin terms of comforts and conveniences 
p29700
aVnever before 
p29701
aVnever ever before 
p29702
aVanother generation of humanity ever knew
p29703
aVthe kind of comforts and conveniences that we have today 
p29704
aVbut at the same time 
p29705
aVwe are whining like never before 
p29706
aVbecause as the comforts and convenience increase on the outside 
p29707
aVas there is less to complain about what is happening around you 
p29708
aVthe emptiness of within echoes within you in a horrible way 
p29709
aVwhen you re fighting for survival 
p29710
aVwhen every day you are struggling to fix small things on the outside 
p29711
aVyou will not realize this 
p29712
aVwhen outside is well settled 
p29713
aVthat is when you will see how hollow life has become 
p29714
aVthe biggest question in the world  
p29715
aVyou will see in the next few decades   is
p29716
aVwhat the hell are we doing here anyway 
p29717
aVbecause everything that needs to be fixed on the outside is done 
p29718
aVnow what 
p29719
aV7 2 billion people on the planet
p29720
aVbut right now  gradually  it's looming large
p29721
aVloneliness is one of the biggest problems 
p29722
aVdogs are being tortured to fulfill human loneliness  
p29723
aVbecause as you dedicate yourself more and more to your intellect 
p29724
aVyou will naturally become more and more lonely
p29725
aVbecause it keeps on dissecting and cutting life into various pieces for examination
p29726
aVand then you will see you yourself will be split up into many parts after some time 
p29727
aVif you go by the intellect hundred percent 
p29728
aVthe next dimension of the mind is referred to as ahankara 
p29729
aVnormally  people think it means ego 
p29730
aVno  it means identity 
p29731
aVyou re identified with something 
p29732
aVthe moment you re identified with something 
p29733
aVyour intellect will work only to protect that identity 
p29734
aVno matter what  whichever way you think 
p29735
aVyour ideas of which nation you belong to 
p29736
aVwhich race you belong to 
p29737
aVwhich culture you belong to 
p29738
aVwhich religion you belong to 
p29739
aVwhich gender you belong to 
p29740
aVthe moment you get identified 
p29741
ag29734
aVso  it is a certain kind of prejudice 
p29742
aVwell  you may say 
p29743
aV i m not prejudiced  i m very broad minded 
p29744
aVall right  it's a broad prejudice 
p29745
aVbecause people are willing to live and die for what they re identified with
p29746
aVbecause the nature of the intellect is
p29747
aVif you take away the identity 
p29748
aVit will not know what to do 
p29749
aVit needs a strong identity 
p29750
aVa strong sense of who i am 
p29751
aVif you ask   who am i 
p29752
aVyour intellect will not function 
p29753
aVyou must know who you are   
p29754
aVa strong sense of belief that this is what i am 
p29755
aVthat is when your intellect will function in a certain way 
p29756
aVthis is like
p29757
aVintellect is like a sharp knife 
p29758
aVahankara  or the identity  is the hand that holds it 
p29759
aVall the suffering on the planet
p29760
aVwhen was the last time when somebody stabbed you 
p29761
aVeven though you re living in la   i am asking
p29762
aVwhen was the last time it happened 
p29763
aVnever happened 
p29764
aVmaybe when you were in school  somebody poked you with a pin  at the most
p29765
aVor they  even that did not happen 
p29766
aVthey ignored you  
p29767
aVor what i m saying is
p29768
aVhow much suffering for a human being is actually coming from outside 
p29769
aValmost nothing 
p29770
aVrest is all self help 
p29771
aVbecause this  is a sharp knife given to you 
p29772
aVunsteady hand 
p29773
aVevery day it's cutting itself 
p29774
aVyou know  we were   we were trekking in nepal and tibet region
p29775
aVand i was in a tent 
p29776
aVsomeone was cutting an apple
p29777
aVand someone else  another person says 
p29778
aV this is a very sharp knife  be careful 
p29779
aVit irritates me because such an obvious thing 
p29780
aVyou call it a knife only because it s sharp  
p29781
aVif that damn thing is not sharp  why will i call it a knife  
p29782
aVand if it's a child 
p29783
aVyes 
p29784
aVa full grown man  you don t tell him it s a sharp knife  
p29785
aVi ignored it and i was working on something 
p29786
aVanother two minutes  again it is said 
p29787
aV it's a very sharp knife  be careful 
p29788
aVi said   come on  leave him alone  
p29789
aVhe s a grown man  leave him alone  this is
p29790
aVhe is not handling some super instrument 
p29791
aVa knife 
p29792
aVhe should know how to handle a knife 
p29793
aV no  no  sadhguru  it's a very sharp knife   
p29794
aVall right 
p29795
aVi get back to my work 
p29796
aVtwo minutes later  he cuts his hand  
p29797
aVokay 
p29798
aVnow  the problem is just this 
p29799
aVyou ve been given a sharp knife 
p29800
ag29773
aVevery day cutting yourself 
p29801
aVyou may call it stress 
p29802
aVyou may call it anxiety 
p29803
aVyou may call it fear 
p29804
aVyou may call it misery 
p29805
aVyou call it what you want 
p29806
aVall that s happening is your intellect is working against you 
p29807
aVthat s all it is 
p29808
aVunless somebody is stabbing you from outside  that s a different issue 
p29809
aVwe need to deal with that differently 
p29810
aVrest is all your own intelligence turning against you 
p29811
aVyou may call it thousand different
p29812
aV no  no  my mother in law  my boss  my neighbor 
p29813
aVthey are
p29814
aVthey are not stabbing you 
p29815
aVthey re only saying what they want to say 
p29816
aVit is you who is poking yourself because an unsteady hand  that s all 
p29817
aVbut this intellect cannot function without a memory bank 
p29818
aVso what is called as manas is a silo of memory 
p29819
aVthere are eight dimensions of memory 
p29820
aVlet's not go into the detail but you know this much  
p29821
aVthere is a conscious memory 
p29822
aVtoday  they re recognizing a subconscious memory 
p29823
aVyou know there is genetic memory 
p29824
aVyou may not remember how your great great great grandfather looked like
p29825
aVbut his nose is sitting on your face  
p29826
aVa million years ago how your forefathers were 
p29827
aVeven today your body remembers 
p29828
aVyou may not remember here 
p29829
aVbut your body remembers every aspect of it 
p29830
aVeven the color of the skin it is remembering  not forgotten 
p29831
aVso there is genetic memory 
p29832
aVthere is evolutionary memory 
p29833
aVlike this  there s a profound dimension of memory in the body 
p29834
aVthere are trillion times more memory in your body than in your mind 
p29835
aVso this is why this  is called as manomayakosha 
p29836
aVthis is an entire manas  not in one place 
p29837
aVintellect may be up here 
p29838
aVbut the manas spreads right through the system 
p29839
aVevery cell in the body has a memory of its own 
p29840
aVhas an intelligence of its own 
p29841
aVnow the fourth dimension of intelligence is called chitta 
p29842
aVthis is a dimension of intelligence which is unsullied by memory 
p29843
aVif you touch this dimension 
p29844
aVthen the memory has no influence on you 
p29845
aVyour genetic memory  your evolutionary memory 
p29846
aVyour conscious memories  unconscious memory  subconscious memory 
p29847
aVwhatever kinds of memories you have 
p29848
aVit has no influence on you 
p29849
aVor in other words  past cannot recycle itself through you 
p29850
aVsee  right now  you take on this form because of a certain memory 
p29851
aVit's a certain software 
p29852
aVtch  if you eat  let's say you re a man and you eat a piece of bread 
p29853
aVthis piece of bread turns into a man 
p29854
aVyou are woman and you eat a piece of bread  the same piece of bread turns into a woman 
p29855
aVyou give it to your dog  it turns into a dog 
p29856
aVvery intelligent bread  
p29857
aVit is just the memory that you carry 
p29858
aVhere   there is a memory
p29859
aVwhich transforms everything the way it is 
p29860
aVso  this dimension of intelligence which is called as chitta 
p29861
aVwhich is untouched by any kind of memory 
p29862
aVjust pure intelligence  is of significance
p29863
aVbecause it's beyond 
p29864
aVit is beyond your species 
p29865
aVit is beyond your form 
p29866
aVit s beyond your gender 
p29867
aVit's beyond your culture 
p29868
aVit's beyond every kind of influence which is essentially memory within you 
p29869
aVmay be unconscious 
p29870
aVbut it is memory playing out in so many ways 
p29871
aVas long as memory is playing out 
p29872
aVwhat it means is 
p29873
aVyou re
p29874
aVin india  we say you are in a state of samsara 
p29875
aVsamsara means  lot of people today understand as family  
p29876
aVsamsara doesn t mean family 
p29877
aVsamsara means a cyclical life 
p29878
aVyou are in cycles of life 
p29879
aVif you re in cycles or if you re going in circles 
p29880
aVwhat does it mean 
p29881
aVthat means you re not getting anywhere  that s what it means 
p29882
aVa cycle is nice 
p29883
aVit gives you good exercise 
p29884
aVthis is like running on a treadmill 
p29885
aVif you re seeking exercise  it's good 
p29886
aVbut if you want to go somewhere  it's no good 
p29887
aVif you put your treadmill out here and keep running on it 
p29888
aVmorning becomes evening 
p29889
aVfall becomes winter 
p29890
aVwinter becomes summer 
p29891
aVeverything will happen 
p29892
aVseasons will change 
p29893
aVscenery will change 
p29894
ag29892
aVonly thing is you don t go anywhere 
p29895
aVthis is what samsara means 
p29896
aVas long as you re functioning within the first three dimensions of intelligence 
p29897
aVyou re in a cyclical mode 
p29898
aVit is all right to exercise yourself
p29899
aVbut it s not good to go somewhere 
p29900
aVso if you want to transcend the samsara nature of who you are
p29901
aVor the cyclical nature of your existence 
p29902
aVthen you touch the dimension of intelligence which is referred to as chitta 
p29903
aVwhy the so called eastern wisdom is of great significance 
p29904
aVwhy the dharma of the east is so significant and important is
p29905
aVbecause this comes from chitta 
p29906
aVthis does not come from buddhi 
p29907
aVthis does not come from manas 
p29908
aVthis does not come from ahankara 
p29909
aVthis comes from chitta
p29910
aVand only that which does not come from your individual identity or individual memory 
p29911
aVthat can be truly universal 
p29912
aVso for this  we said 
p29913
aV this is sanathan dharm 
p29914
aVthis does not mean hindu religion 
p29915
aVthis is a very wrong conception 
p29916
aVsanathan dharm means the ultimate law of nature 
p29917
aVwhen we say nature  there is physical nature and there is an inner nature 
p29918
aVthere are two dimensions  for this 
p29919
aVaccordingly we made two dimensions of laws 
p29920
aVphysical nature is a changing thing 
p29921
aVit's always in a process of change and a flux 
p29922
aVbut the inner nature is a constant process 
p29923
aVso we made two dimensions of expression for this dharma
p29924
aVcalled shruthis and smrithis 
p29925
aVone is always to be updated for every generation 
p29926
aVotherwise two generations will keep on bickering and clashing  
p29927
aVyou have to update it 
p29928
aVanother is eternal 
p29929
aVit s always there 
p29930
aVit's nobody s business to change it
p29931
aVbecause it cannot be changed because the fundamentals of life has not changed 
p29932
aVbased on this  an entire wisdom arose
p29933
aVas to how to exist within you
p29934
aVand how to operate around you 
p29935
aVthis happened in 1924 
p29936
aVthere was a bishop in the orthodox greek religion 
p29937
aVwhere  you know 
p29938
aVthere is orthodox greek segment of christians 
p29939
aVthey have a pope of their own in istanbul 
p29940
aVthey believe they are the only true christians 
p29941
aVothers are all riffraff according to them 
p29942
aVso he served this particular segment  which is very orthodox and rigid 
p29943
aVbeing in istanbul 
p29944
aVbeing on the silk route 
p29945
aVall kinds of stories of indian mysticism kept wafting across the bosporus 
p29946
aVso  he has a longing to go to india
p29947
aVand see a real yogi or a mystic 
p29948
aVbut being a man of cloth 
p29949
aVhe could not choose where to go and where not to go 
p29950
aVafter he passed sixty years of age 
p29951
aVwhen he semi retired 
p29952
aVhe got an opportunity and went to india
p29953
aVand came to southern india 
p29954
aVso his desire is to meet a real yogi 
p29955
aVnot a book yogi 
p29956
aVnot a studio yogi but a real one  
p29957
aVso somebody directed him and said 
p29958
aV go up this hill  there in this kind of place  there will be one yogi 
p29959
aVso he went up 
p29960
aVwell  he s not made for the mountains 
p29961
aVhe went huffing and puffing up and then he found in front of a small cave 
p29962
aVa yogi was sitting  eyes closed  totally blissed out 
p29963
aVhe went there and
p29964
aVhe has been told that if you see a indian yogi 
p29965
aVyou must prostrate 
p29966
aVwell  he was not made for that 
p29967
aVbut he somehow managed 
p29968
aVhuffed and puffed and sat down 
p29969
aVhearing this commotion 
p29970
aVthe yogi opened his eyes and smiled 
p29971
aVimmediately  the bishop looked at him and said 
p29972
aV can i ask you a question 
p29973
aVthe yogi said   by all means 
p29974
aVthe bishop asked   what is life 
p29975
aVthis is after sixty  
p29976
aVyou should have asked this question when you were eight  
p29977
aVat least when you re sixteen   
p29978
aVsixty 
p29979
aVbut what to do 
p29980
aVbetter late than never  
p29981
aVhe asked 
p29982
aVthen the yogi laughed and went into raptures 
p29983
aV oh life 
p29984
aVlife is like the fragrance of jasmine upon gentle spring breeze   
p29985
aVthe bishop looked at him and said 
p29986
aV what 
p29987
aVlife is like fragrance of jasmine upon gentle spring breeze 
p29988
aVour teacher told us 
p29989
aV life is like a thorn  
p29990
aVonce it gets into you  
p29991
aVif you sit  it hurts 
p29992
aVif you stand  it hurts 
p29993
aVif you lie down  it hurts   
p29994
aVwhat is this fragrance of jasmine upon gentle spring breeze 
p29995
aVso the yogi smiled and said 
p29996
aV well  that s his life   
p29997
aVso this comes from the fundamental that 
p29998
aVwhen a human being clearly  experientially understands
p29999
aVthat entire experience of human life is created from within 
p30000
aVnever from outside 
p30001
aVright now  as you sit here  do you at least see me 
p30002
aVeven if you re not listening to me  i m saying  
p30003
aVcan you use your hand and show where i am 
p30004
aVah  no  no  you re getting it all wrong 
p30005
aVyou know i m a mystic from south india  
p30006
aVnow this light is falling upon me 
p30007
aVreflecting  going through your lenses 
p30008
aVinverted image in the retina  you know the whole story 
p30009
aV yes 
p30010
aV where do you see me right now 
p30011
aVwithin yourself 
p30012
aVwhere do you hear me right now 
p30013
ag30012
aVwhere have you seen the entire world 
p30014
ag30012
aVhave you ever experienced anything outside of yourself 
p30015
aVright now  someone next to you  if they touch you 
p30016
aVyou think you re experiencing their hand 
p30017
aVno 
p30018
aVyou re only experiencing the sensations in your hand 
p30019
ag29584
aVyou cannot experience anything outside of yourself 
p30020
aVwhen everything 
p30021
aVwhen the entire experience of life is caused from within you 
p30022
aVat least it must happen the way you want it  isn't it  hmm 
p30023
aVthe world will not happen the way you want it 
p30024
aVat least  the experience of living here  within you 
p30025
aVmust happen the way you want it 
p30026
aVif  if  if your experience of life happened just the way you want it 
p30027
aVhow would you keep yourself 
p30028
aVblissful or miserable 
p30029
aV blissful 
p30030
aV please  you must tell me  i m going to bless you  
p30031
ag30029
ag30030
aV for yourself   definitely  highest level of pleasantness for yourself 
p30032
aVwhat you want for your neighbor may be debatable 
p30033
aVbut you know what you want for yourself  isn't it 
p30034
aVnow  blissfulness or pleasantness of life is not a goal by itself 
p30035
aVit is only when you re blissful by your own nature 
p30036
aVthat means you determine the nature of your experience 
p30037
aVno matter what is the situation 
p30038
aVyou determine the nature of your experience 
p30039
aVor in other words  you have no fear of suffering 
p30040
aVonly and only when there is no fear of suffering 
p30041
aVwill you walk full stride in this life 
p30042
aVotherwise it's always about
p30043
aV what will happen to me 
p30044
aVwhat will happen to me 
p30045
aVevery step is a half a step 
p30046
aVnow  this so called spirit of eastern wisdom comes from those beings
p30047
aVwho walked full stride 
p30048
aVwho determined the nature of their experience 
p30049
aVthe outside never decided who they are 
p30050
aVso  they could walk full stride and explore the depths and dimensions of life
p30051
aVthat others never dared to touch
p30052
aVbecause most of the humanity is only concerned about
p30053
ag30044
aV what will happen to me  means what 
p30054
aV will i suffer    that s the question 
p30055
aVthe first and foremost thing 
p30056
aVif you truly want to explore dimensions which we are referring to
p30057
aVas another dimension of wisdom or knowing  is
p30058
aVthat first you must determine the nature of your experience 
p30059
aVyou have no fear of suffering 
p30060
aVonly then  truly exploring human consciousness becomes a reality 
p30061
aVtouching dimensions of intelligence
p30062
aVwhich gives access to the entire universe becomes a possibility 
p30063
aVi m supposed to open up for questions  
p30064
aVit's time you ask your questions please 
p30065
aV the population i work with
p30066
aVthat are in the verge of homelessness or they are addicts
p30067
aVif i tell them that  it is your intellect 
p30068
aVand it's your perception 
p30069
aVand this doesn t exist  they will laugh at me
p30070
aVbecause it definitely exists 
p30071
aV they must because it's the dumbest thing to say  
p30072
aV right 
p30073
aVso i wanted to know this spirituality that you teach 
p30074
aVthe spirituality that many gurus teach 
p30075
aVhow is it usable for someone that doesn t have food to eat
p30076
aVand is going to become homeless
p30077
aVand there is so many problems 
p30078
aVespecially in america 
p30079
aVi mean how
p30080
aVof course i teach them resiliency  it's a different fact 
p30081
aVbut every time i m going to open my mouth and use some of your teachings 
p30082
aVi have to step back  
p30083
aV now the first problem is that you believe in the teachings because
p30084
aVthis is the problem with the entire world  
p30085
aVthey have been cultured in some belief or the other 
p30086
aVthis is what is significant about
p30087
aVwhat is referred to as sanathana dharma
p30088
aVor what is referred to as the indian way of looking at things is 
p30089
aVthis is not a land of belief systems 
p30090
aVthis is a land of seekers 
p30091
aVnever ever were anybody encouraged to believe anything 
p30092
aVif you see anything that comes from that land 
p30093
aVyou will see 
p30094
aVit is all about questions  
p30095
aVnever about a belief system 
p30096
aVif you enter a indian home 
p30097
aVin the same house 
p30098
aVfive different people are worshiping twenty five different gods and goddesses
p30099
aV  they re still not made up their minds
p30100
aVwhich is  laughter
p30101
aVand they have no problem  they ll never fight about it 
p30102
aVbecause it's a land of seeking 
p30103
aVso first mistake you make is you believe what i say 
p30104
aVi am constantly reminding you 
p30105
aV don t believe a goddamn thing that anybody says
p30106
aVbut don t be foolish enough to disbelieve it either 
p30107
aVall you have to do is experiment with it  
p30108
aVdoes it work or doesn t work 
p30109
aVif it works  you keep it  otherwise rubbish it  what's the problem 
p30110
aVnow  about somebody being hungry 
p30111
aVsomebody being homeless 
p30112
aVsomebody being in a war zones  
p30113
aVall kinds of horrible things are happening on the planet 
p30114
aVi am not ignorant of it 
p30115
aVanyway  you said living in a temple
p30116
aVi am not living in a temple 
p30117
aVi am more of the world than you are 
p30118
aVevery day 
p30119
aVi want you to understand 
p30120
aVi m running a volunteer organization
p30121
aVwith over 4 000 full time volunteers
p30122
aVand over three million part time volunteers doing variety of work 
p30123
aVhuge projects 
p30124
aVover a dozen businesses
p30125
aVand the spiritual movement  okay  
p30126
aVnow  i want you to understand 
p30127
aVmore things are going wrong with my life on a daily basis than anybody s life  
p30128
aVnow when a man is hungry
p30129
aVif you try to tell him 
p30130
aV your intellect is the source of your problem    
p30131
aVit's obscene 
p30132
ag30132
aVit's nothing short of that 
p30133
aVi never spoke to hungry people and said 
p30134
aV your intellect is the source of the problem 
p30135
aVi m talking to people who re bulging  in so many ways 
p30136
aVin their head and in their body  they re bulging  
p30137
aVi m only talking to that segment of the population 
p30138
aVthose who are not fed well 
p30139
aVi m doing social projects with them 
p30140
aVwith nourishment 
p30141
aVeducation 
p30142
aVhealth 
p30143
aVall for free 
p30144
aVwill i ever go and talk to a starved man in an indian village
p30145
aVand tell him 
p30146
aV your intellect is the basis of all your problems   
p30147
aVwhat makes you think that i m that stupid   i
p30148
aVdo i look like that  
p30149
aVso you also don t do that  
p30150
aVthis is for you 
p30151
aVyou need to understand this  there are million problems on the planet 
p30152
aVall these million problems are essentially because
p30153
aVthose who are reasonably well have never cared to reach out and do
p30154
aVwhat needs to be done in the world 
p30155
aVin many ways  they re making sure those people don t get it 
p30156
ag29784
aVin the year 2012 
p30157
aVwe have produced enough food for 18 2 billion people 
p30158
aVwe had only 6 6 billion people in that year
p30159
aVbut still  fifty percent of the population is malnourished
p30160
aVand hardly eaten anything 
p30161
aVthis is not because there is no food 
p30162
aVbecause
p30163
aVthis is because you and me have not cared  isn't it 
p30164
aVso 
p30165
aVis it true 
p30166
aVis it true nobody stabbed you in the last twenty five years 
p30167
ag29784
aVbut is it also true you re suffering various things of tension  stress  anxiety  this  that 
p30168
aVis it a product of your mind
p30169
aVor somebody else poking you from outside 
p30170
aVit is your reaction to the existential situation outside 
p30171
aVinstead of doing what is needed 
p30172
aVwhat you see is
p30173
aVwhen you see something wrong happening
p30174
aVor when you see some suffering
p30175
aVor something comes your way 
p30176
aVyou decide to poke yourself 
p30177
aVthis is about incapacitating yourself 
p30178
aVinstead of seeing when there is a problem 
p30179
aVyou need empowerment 
p30180
aVnot incapacitating yourself  isn't it 
p30181
aVi m talking about empowering you
p30182
aVso that your damn intelligence functions for you 
p30183
aVnot against you 
p30184
aVthe moment your intelligence is working against you 
p30185
aVno god in the universe is going to help you
p30186
aVand can help you 
p30187
ag29784
aVif your intelligence has turned against you 
p30188
aVyou are a finished case 
p30189
aVso i m saying  first let your intelligence work for you 
p30190
aVif it works for you 
p30191
aVthere are many miraculous things that you can do
p30192
aVfor all those people who have still not eaten properly 
p30193
aVfor whom basic things have not been taken care of 
p30194
aVthat s our business because
p30195
aVsomehow we ve landed in a place
p30196
aVwhere you and me are at least eating well 
p30197
aVonce we are in such a privilege 
p30198
aVwe must use our intelligence to see what is the best thing we can do in the world 
p30199
aVnot sit here and twist yourself out 
p30200
aVi m saying don t twist yourself out 
p30201
aVif you re joyful 
p30202
aVnaturally you will do the best things you can do 
p30203
aVif i meet you when you re very happy 
p30204
aVwill you be nice to me 
p30205
aV i ll always be nice to you 
p30206
aV no  no  no  
p30207
aVi don t believe that 
p30208
aVwhen you re very happy  if i meet you  i m sure you re a wonderful person 
p30209
aVbut when you re depressed  when you re unhappy  when you re frustrated 
p30210
aVif i meet you  you could be a nasty person 
p30211
ag30010
aV this is true with every human being  isn't it 
p30212
aVso the first and foremost work that any human being has to do is
p30213
aVthat you make this  into a pleasant piece of life
p30214
aVso that you naturally exude this pleasantness in every possible way 
p30215
aVif this  is feeling unpleasant
p30216
aVand you tell this one to be pleasant 
p30217
aVis it going to work 
p30218
aVwe are trying to fix the stomach full people right now  
p30219
aV it was a pleasure listening to you  unbelievable 
p30220
aVbut my question is
p30221
aVwhat can i do so that i can acquire your skill of clarity 
p30222
aVhonesty  
p30223
aVand honestly  generally speaking 
p30224
aVvery few people  you know  are like you are 
p30225
aVi m sure you have heard this before  
p30226
aVso what makes you
p30227
aVwhat makes you so secure from within and be so candid 
p30228
aVhonest 
p30229
aVtruthful 
p30230
aVclarity of expression  
p30231
aV i didn t know that s a popular question  
p30232
aVwhen we say clarity 
p30233
aVthat means  tch 
p30234
aVi want to tell you a joke but it's
p30235
aVit's a dirty joke so i thought i ll skip that one  
p30236
aV go for it 
p30237
aV please tell 
p30238
aV no  no  i ll s  i ll come with something milder  you know  
p30239
aVthe problem with the human being right now  is this  
p30240
aVwe have created a world
p30241
aVwe have created education systems
p30242
aVwhere we believe that
p30243
aVhuman beings are essentially all wrong
p30244
aVor the creation is all wrong
p30245
aVor the source of creation or the creator is all wrong
p30246
aVand you re going to fix it  
p30247
aVthis is a convoluted idea 
p30248
aVinstead of paying attention to life 
p30249
aVwe are coming up with philosophies and philosophies and philosophies 
p30250
aVphilosophies are fantastic explanations to that which cannot be explained 
p30251
aVif you want to know life 
p30252
aVyou must pay attention to life  isn't it 
p30253
aVright now  do you agree with me  madam 
p30254
aVthat this human mechanism is the most sophisticated machine on the planet 
p30255
ag30010
aV do you agree with me 
p30256
aVare you a doctor 
p30257
ag30010
aV yes  
p30258
aVso  this  is such a complex machine 
p30259
aVthis  is the super  super computer  all right 
p30260
aVi m asking have you bothered to read the user s manual  
p30261
aVif you understand how this  functions 
p30262
aVyou would know how to use it 
p30263
aVeven if you take a simple gadget like a phone 
p30264
aVthe more you know about it  the better you can use it 
p30265
aVisn't it so 
p30266
aVyou have definitely  coming from india 
p30267
aVyou have definitely been bombarded with this thing about
p30268
aVrealization
p30269
aVself realization 
p30270
ag30010
aV let me put it in very simple terms 
p30271
aVwhat self realization means is
p30272
aVfirst of all  what the word realization means  
p30273
aVrealization is not an achievement 
p30274
aVit is not an accomplishment 
p30275
aVit is just realization 
p30276
aVthat means something that s always here 
p30277
aVyou just managed to see it now 
p30278
aVthat means you were stupid all your life  
p30279
aVjust now you saw it  
p30280
aVyou did not invent something new 
p30281
aVyou did not ramp yourself up to a mountain 
p30282
ag30018
aVyou just saw the most obvious thing which was always here  
p30283
aVyou realized 
p30284
ag30165
aVrealization means you realized how foolish you have been 
p30285
aVeverything has been right here
p30286
aVand you didn t get it 
p30287
aVso there are many ways 
p30288
aVof course  most of you being from the indian origin 
p30289
aVi have not read this
p30290
aVi have to admit  i have never read the gita 
p30291
aVbecause it never occurred to me 
p30292
aVi m sorry  
p30293
aVi know this is a shock  
p30294
aVbut you know  be
p30295
aVliving in india 
p30296
aVbits and pieces of this are always floating around in the air and it's
p30297
aVyou know many pieces of it
p30298
aVbut i ve never really studied it in any sense 
p30299
aVso when  on a certain moment 
p30300
aVwhen arjuna asked 
p30301
aV what is the nature of this truth that you re talking about 
p30302
aVwhere is it 
p30303
aVso krishna laughed and said 
p30304
aV the highest truth about your life is at the tip of your nose 
p30305
aVnow there are many schools of yoga intensely focusing on the tips of their noses
p30306
aV 
p30307
aVplease try it for two minutes  you will get a headache  
p30308
aVyou will not get enlightened  
p30309
aVwhat he is saying is  it is the most obvious thing 
p30310
aVit is the most obvious thing
p30311
aVbut right now  the problem is
p30312
aVall the instruments of perception that you have are outward bound
p30313
aVbut the seat of your experience is within you 
p30314
aVthe fundamental seat of your experience is within you
p30315
aVbut all the instruments of perception are outward bound 
p30316
aVso how should i do this 
p30317
aVyou must understand
p30318
aVanything beyond survival  if it has to enter your life 
p30319
aVsome striving is needed 
p30320
aVlet's say 
p30321
aVas a little infant 
p30322
aVyou were left in the jungle without human contact 
p30323
aVif something edible came in front of you 
p30324
aVwould you first try your ears 
p30325
aVthen nostrils 
p30326
aVand somehow by accident find your mouth 
p30327
aVis that so 
p30328
aVyou would just know where to put it  isn't it 
p30329
aVso what i m saying is everything that is necessary for survival
p30330
aVis built into you 
p30331
aVit
p30332
aVyou re born with it 
p30333
aVthe five senses takes care of it 
p30334
aVbut if you want to know something more 
p30335
aVyou have to strive 
p30336
aVfor example 
p30337
aVdo you remember 
p30338
aVwhen you were three  four or five years of age 
p30339
aVyou had to learn to write the alphabet 
p30340
aVthat damn  a  how complicated it was
p30341
aVand they  on top it  there were two versions  
p30342
aVyou had to write it a hundred times to get it  isn't it 
p30343
aVbut today  with your eyes closed 
p30344
aVyou can write 
p30345
aVif that striving was not there 
p30346
aVtoday could you write 
p30347
aVtoday would you know language 
p30348
aVso  anything beyond survival needs striving 
p30349
aVwithout the needed striving  it won t happen 
p30350
aVthere are ways to perceive the interiority of who you are
p30351
aVbut unfortunately  there s been no striving 
p30352
aVright now  we made this technology into such a simple 
p30353
aValmost like a physical science 
p30354
aV a  plus  b  equals this or
p30355
aVtwo parts of hydrogen  one part of oxygen 
p30356
aVwater will come 
p30357
aVif a great scientist puts it together  only water will come 
p30358
aVan idiot puts it together  only water will come 
p30359
aVso we made the entire yoga sutras like this 
p30360
aVthat if you do this  this  and this 
p30361
aVthis will happen to you 
p30362
aVthat simple and all i m asking  generally from people is
p30363
aVabout thirty  thirty to thirty two hours of focused time
p30364
aVto develop an instrument where they can turn inward 
p30365
aV ooof  thirty hours is too much   
p30366
aVi m saying if you cannot dedicate
p30367
aVa little bit of time to know what this  is 
p30368
aVthat means your existence must be truly worthless 
p30369
aVif this  is worthwhile 
p30370
aVyou must pay attention to this   isn't it 
p30371
ag30252
aVthis  is life  isn't it 
p30372
aVwhen i say the word life 
p30373
aVmaybe you re thinking about your profession 
p30374
aVyour family 
p30375
aVyour car 
p30376
aVyour home 
p30377
ag30018
aVthese are all accessories 
p30378
aVthis  is life  isn't it so 
p30379
aVhello 
p30380
ag30258
aV but no attention has been paid 
p30381
aVyour idea of fixing life is fixing all kinds of things 
p30382
aVthis happened one day 
p30383
aVshankaran pillai was going home  
p30384
aVno  i m not done  
p30385
aVshankaran pillai was going home 
p30386
aV30 in the evening 
p30387
aVthe rules at home  
p30388
aV00 he must be home 
p30389
aV30 
p30390
aVhe thought   there is still time 
p30391
aVlet me have a quick drink and go 
p30392
aVhe just stepped into the local bar 
p30393
aVhe had a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick drink  
p30394
aVthen he looked at the time   
p30395
aV00 am 
p30396
aVtch 
p30397
aVyou know  drinking people are like yogis 
p30398
aVthey become timeless  
p30399
aVthere s a certain correlation  
p30400
aVthen it's late and he got off the bar stool and tried to walk 
p30401
aVit's such an unfair world 
p30402
aVa man is supposed to walk on a round planet 
p30403
aVas if that s not enough  it spins  
p30404
aVyou notice that the planet is round and it's spinning
p30405
aVonly when you ve had a few drops more
p30406
aVor a few drops are missing between your two ears  
p30407
aVeither you re drunk or you have a vertigo 
p30408
aVthen you notice the planet is round and spinning 
p30409
aVotherwise you think it's flat and you re going on fine  
p30410
aVso with great difficulty  he was walking sideways
p30411
aVand trying to find his way home 
p30412
aVhe was crossing a garden and he flipped over
p30413
aVand fell face down into a rose bush 
p30414
aVhis face became a mess 
p30415
aVthen he somehow reached home and you know 
p30416
aVthese keyholes are so minute 
p30417
aVit took twenty minutes to find the keyhole 
p30418
aVthen he found his way up to the bedroom
p30419
aVand then he went into the bathroom
p30420
aVand he looked at his face 
p30421
aVit was a real mess 
p30422
aVthen he opened the medicine cabinet 
p30423
aVtook out medicine 
p30424
aVplaster 
p30425
aVband aid 
p30426
aVfixed himself up and slowly crawled into the bed 
p30427
aVfortunately  the wife is a big sleeper  
p30428
aVhe slept 
p30429
aVmorning eight o clock 
p30430
aVthe wife 
p30431
aVtook a bucketful of cold water and splashed it on him 
p30432
aV aahh    
p30433
aVwater boarded  he woke up 
p30434
aVhe said   why  why  it's only a sunday 
p30435
aVshe said 
p30436
aV you fool  again drinking  she s
p30437
aVhe said   honey  six months ago  i promised you 
p30438
aVsince then  i haven t touched a drop 
p30439
aVshe grabbed him by the shirt
p30440
aVand took him into the bathroom and showed him  
p30441
aVall the plaster was on the mirror  
p30442
aVwhy
p30443
aVwhy people have lost their clarity 
p30444
aVwhy people have lost their clarity is only because of this  
p30445
aVthat if there is any suffering here  
p30446
aVthey think this one  should be fixed  
p30447
aVif something else happens  that one should be fixed 
p30448
aVif something else happens  that one should be fixed  
p30449
aVevery day morning prayer means what 
p30450
aVtrying to fix the god  
p30451
ag29784
aVyou re trying to fix up the god  isn't it 
p30452
aVso day in and day out 
p30453
aVfor everything that happens within you 
p30454
aVinstead of fixing this one  
p30455
aVyou re trying to fix everything around you 
p30456
aVno wonder you will be confused
p30457
aVwe ve fixed the planet sufficiently 
p30458
aVat least in this part of the world 
p30459
aVif you fix it any more  there ll be no planet left 
p30460
aVbut are people bursting with ecstasy 
p30461
ag30018
aVso because
p30462
aVclarity has been lost simply because of this 
p30463
aVif you understand 
p30464
aVif life has to really become beautiful for you 
p30465
aVthis one  has to be fixed 
p30466
aVif you understand this one thing 
p30467
aVclarity will dawn within you  
p30468
aV i actually have a question on chitta 
p30469
aVhow can we tap into chitta  which is
p30470
aVwhat you said 
p30471
aVmemory with no effect and the ability to break the cycles 
p30472
aV right here  you want to do that  
p30473
aVyou can
p30474
aVyou can take one fundamental step today 
p30475
aVthat is i want you to
p30476
aVanyway you re  you ve already written down the question also 
p30477
aVyou have the habit of writing things 
p30478
aVso you just sit down today before you go to bed 
p30479
aVwrite down what are all the different types of identities
p30480
aVthat you have taken  
p30481
aVstarting from your body 
p30482
aVeverything else 
p30483
aVjust write it down and see
p30484
aVif you can create a little distance from these identifications 
p30485
aVjust work on that 
p30486
aVthat s the first step 
p30487
aVthat you are not identified with anything 
p30488
aVyou re just here 
p30489
aVthrobbing as a piece of life 
p30490
aVnot as this or that 
p30491
aVsee
p30492
aV but what can i do  i am a young woman 
p30493
aVright now  yes 
p30494
aVwhen you sit here among people 
p30495
aVif you re just walking by yourself in the garden 
p30496
aVyou don t really think you re a young woman 
p30497
aVor if you are that identified 
p30498
aVyou can't help it even there 
p30499
aVif you just doze off a little bit 
p30500
aVyou don t sleep as a young woman 
p30501
aVyou just sleep simply as life  isn't it 
p30502
aVi m saying something so fundamental as your body and gender 
p30503
aVeven that identity is only on the surface 
p30504
aVyour caste  creed  religion  race  
p30505
aVthis is even more on the surface 
p30506
aVso i m saying 
p30507
aVyou can't do it in the day right now but before you go to bed 
p30508
aVsee if you can keep all your identities by the bedside table and sleep 
p30509
ag29625
aVto work in the world  you need an identity 
p30510
aVwithout identity  you cannot function in the world 
p30511
aVso before going to sleep 
p30512
aVtake off all the identities 
p30513
aVkeep it on your bedside table  
p30514
aVmorning it ll be there  it ll not go anywhere  
p30515
aVleave it there and go to sleep 
p30516
aVyou have started the journey 
p30517
aV i would like to hear guruji s turning point in life 
p30518
aVwhere he separated himself from his intellect
p30519
aVand his inner self 
p30520
aV do i look like someone who lost my intellect
p30521
ag30307
aVi didn t think that i was coming out so dumb
p30522
ag30307
aVthis is  she s asking for a story 
p30523
aVdo you want a story 
p30524
ag30258
aV okay  
p30525
aVone must understand
p30526
aVit's a process that you set forth 
p30527
aVtch  this started happening to me when i was just
p30528
aVaround four  four and a half years of age 
p30529
aVi suddenly realized one day that i don t know anything 
p30530
aVi don t know anything means
p30531
aVi don t know anything at all 
p30532
aVto such an extent 
p30533
aVif somebody gives me a glass of water 
p30534
aVi would not know what is water 
p30535
aVi know if i drink this water  it ll quench my thirst
p30536
aVand different ways of using it 
p30537
aVi know what to do with it but i don t know what it is 
p30538
aVwell  actually if you look at it 
p30539
aVeven today you don t know what it is 
p30540
aVit s the only substance present in the planet in all three different states 
p30541
aVthree fourths of the planet is water 
p30542
aVnearly three fourths of your body is water 
p30543
aVif you re looking for life  you look for a drop of water 
p30544
aVthere s lot of excitement  they found a few drops on the mars  
p30545
aVi think people from california need to migrate  
p30546
aVso  i m just staring at this glass of water for hours on end 
p30547
aVif i found a dry leaf  i m just looking at the leaf for five  six hours at a stretch 
p30548
aVif i sit up in my bed staring at the darkness 
p30549
aVthe entire night i m sitting like this  staring 
p30550
aVmy dear father  being a physician 
p30551
aVstarted thinking i need psychiatric evaluation  
p30552
aV this boy is simply staring at something or the other 
p30553
aVunblinking he s staring 
p30554
aVhe s lost it   
p30555
aVmy problem is i look at this one 
p30556
aVi still do not know this one 
p30557
aVthere is no way i m able to shift my attention to another one 
p30558
aVso i
p30559
aVit just held my attention  i couldn t shift 
p30560
aVin this condition  they sent me to school 
p30561
aVand my mother said 
p30562
aV pay attention to the teachers 
p30563
aVi went and paid attention to the teachers   
p30564
aVthe kind of attention that they have never received in their life  
p30565
aVand initially  i understood the words that they were speaking
p30566
aVand what they were trying to say 
p30567
aVafter some time  i realized they re just making sounds 
p30568
aVi m making up the meanings in my head 
p30569
aVeven now  as i speak  i m only making sounds 
p30570
aVyou re making up the meanings  isn't it 
p30571
aVbecause language is a conspiracy between two people  
p30572
aVif you have a conspiracy  what do you do 
p30573
aVthe indians  you speak in your language  
p30574
aVin india  we have this advantage 
p30575
aVwe have 1 300 languages in the country 
p30576
aVwe can have lots of conspiracies going 
p30577
aVbecause we ll speak in our own language 
p30578
aVactually  i m only makings sounds  isn't it 
p30579
aVyou re making up the meanings 
p30580
aVso when i realized i m the one who making up all the meanings 
p30581
aVi stopped making the meanings 
p30582
aVthen i just heard the sounds with full attention 
p30583
aVsee  this is the problem with most people 
p30584
aVthe moment they don t understand they think they need not pay attention 
p30585
aVwhat you do not understand needs more attention
p30586
aVthan what you understand  isn't it
p30587
aVso  as i watched teacher after teacher coming in and making noises and noises and noises and going 
p30588
aVit became very amusing to me and a huge smile spread on my face 
p30589
aVthey were not at all amused  
p30590
aVmy schooling went like this 
p30591
aVvery consistent  
p30592
aVbecause i remember this so well 
p30593
aVi don t know if you still have this
p30594
aVyou still have those monthly tests and report cards that your parents have to sign
p30595
aVand your  you know 
p30596
aVyour children have to get it to you  stuff like that 
p30597
ag30010
aV so  monthly report cards come  i see in the school 
p30598
aVsome children are strutting around because they are first or second 
p30599
aVsome are sitting and crying because they re afraid to go home with their marks card 
p30600
aVnever once in my entire school life did i ever open and see  
p30601
aVthe teachers gave me the card  i took and gave it to my father 
p30602
aVi thought this s a transaction between the two of them  
p30603
aVi had nothing to do with this
p30604
aVbecause i was very consistent 
p30605
aVi always got six zeros 
p30606
aVbecause i always gave an empty paper 
p30607
aVif they insisted  i put my name on it 
p30608
aVotherwise i gave an empty paper  as a rule 
p30609
aVwhen the final exam came  i wrote something and went to the next class 
p30610
aVotherwise all my tests i got zero  zero  zero  zero
p30611
ag30163
aVmillion things  you know 
p30612
aVi have a billion questions in my mind about everything 
p30613
aVthere is nobody around who is capable of answering these questions
p30614
aVbut they re trying to stuff something else into you
p30615
aVwhich i m not interested in 
p30616
aVso  school went like this 
p30617
aVthis s about eight years ago  this school
p30618
aVwhere i studied nearly forty   forty five years ago 
p30619
aVthey came to invite me for their one hundred and twenty fifth anniversary of the school  
p30620
aVso the trustees  
p30621
aVthe third generation of trustees   came to invite me 
p30622
aVthey said   you must come 
p30623
aVi said   see  i was not just a  not good  student  
p30624
aVi was not even a student  why me  you know 
p30625
aVyou call the brilliant students of your school 
p30626
aVwhy me 
p30627
aVthey said    you know  our school has produced union ministers 
p30628
aVour school has produced cricketing stars 
p30629
aVour school has produced film stars 
p30630
aVyou are the only mystic  you must come   
p30631
aVi said   okay   
p30632
aVso i went there to speak and 
p30633
aVand i went and stood up in the quadrangle  looked around  
p30634
aVthe same oppressive buildings  
p30635
aVthen i suddenly remembered this classroom 
p30636
aVi was about thirteen years of age 
p30637
aVone afternoon 
p30638
aVthe teacher is trying to get a response for some question he s asked 
p30639
aVi hear the sounds but i don t hear the words 
p30640
aVafter some time  i don t even hear the sounds 
p30641
aVi don t even see their forms 
p30642
aVi just see all kinds of things 
p30643
aVi know their past  present  and future
p30644
aVbut i don t know what he s saying  
p30645
aVi know his entire life better than him
p30646
aVbut i don t know what he is saying 
p30647
aVand thirty five  forty minutes 
p30648
aVhe desperately tried to get a response from me 
p30649
aVbut those days  i am made like this  
p30650
aVsometimes three days  four days i don t utter a word
p30651
aVnot because i am in silence or something 
p30652
aVwhen you don t know anything  what do you say 
p30653
aVthis  i do not know anything  has grown to such a size 
p30654
aVit's like  you know 
p30655
aVmy mind is billions of questions  simply 
p30656
aVi have a question mark about everything in the universe
p30657
aVand not a single answer  
p30658
aVso  then after thirty five  forty minutes  he got so frustrated 
p30659
aVhe came and held me by the shoulders  shook me violently like this 
p30660
aVand he said 
p30661
aV you must either be the divine or the devil 
p30662
aVi think you are the latter
p30663
aVi did not feel abused by this or insulted by this 
p30664
aVtill then  my problem was  
p30665
aVwhat is this 
p30666
aVwhat is that 
p30667
ag30667
ag30667
ag30667
aVone thing was clear to me   this  is me 
p30668
aVsuddenly this guy confused me about this also  
p30669
aVsuddenly i looked like this   
p30670
aVwhat am i 
p30671
aVam i divine 
p30672
aVam i devil 
p30673
aVwhat the hell am i  
p30674
aVhe just confused me for the first time 
p30675
aVi thought this was clear  
p30676
aVso i tried to stare at myself 
p30677
aVit didn t work 
p30678
aVso i closed my eyes  initially  minutes to hours it went on 
p30679
aVone day  i closed my eyes and sat 
p30680
aVi thought i sat there for twenty five  thirty minutes 
p30681
aVwhen i opened my eyes 
p30682
aVthere s a huge crowd around me 
p30683
aVindia being what it is  there re garlands around me  around my neck 
p30684
aVpeople are pulling my legs  
p30685
aVthey want to know we
p30686
aVsomebody wants to know about his business 
p30687
aVsomebody wants to know when his daughters will get married  
p30688
aVi said 
p30689
aV what the hell 
p30690
aVwhere did you all come from 
p30691
aVthey said   you ve been sitting here for thirteen days 
p30692
aVin my experience  it was only twenty five  thirty minutes 
p30693
aVwhen i tried to open my legs  my knees were stuck 
p30694
aVit took almost an hour and a half 
p30695
aVputting hot water 
p30696
aVmassage 
p30697
aVeverything to get my legs straightened out 
p30698
aVotherwise even i wouldn t have believed it but thirteen days had passed 
p30699
aVin my experience  it just felt like twenty five  thirty minutes 
p30700
aVand suddenly what is inside  what is outside  everything got mixed up 
p30701
aVclearly till then  i was very clear  this is me  that s you  all right 
p30702
aVi had no issue with that one but this is me and that is you 
p30703
aVsuddenly i  this idea of what is me and what is not me got all mixed up
p30704
aVbecause what is me was just everywhere 
p30705
aVnow  this looks like a hallucination and that s what i thought 
p30706
aVi thought i m just losing  you know  going off my rocker 
p30707
aVi m just losing my mind 
p30708
aVbut every cell in my body is bursting with ecstasy 
p30709
aVone thing i know is i don t want to lose it 
p30710
aVit may be madness but i don t want to lose it 
p30711
aVso right now  my whole effort with life is to just rub off that madness on you
p30712
ag30307
aVyou should also know the ecstasy of being alive 
p30713
aVright now  you know the torture of your intellect 
p30714
aVyou must know the ecstasy of being alive 
p30715
aVyou are a piece of life 
p30716
aVrest is all arrangements 
p30717
aVyes or no 
p30718
aVwhy did you make these arrangements 
p30719
aVto enhance your life 
p30720
aVno  no  you made these arrangements mainly to enhance this life 
p30721
aVyou thought with education  your life would enhance itself 
p30722
aVwith money  it would enhance itself 
p30723
aVwith marriage  it would enhance itself 
p30724
aVwith children  it would enhance itself 
p30725
aVnow you started the question  you know 
p30726
aVthis  i wanted to come and meditate but my family  my children  dadada 
p30727
aVas if it's a problem 
p30728
aVthese are accessories that you added to enhance your life 
p30729
aVnot to put your life down 
p30730
ag29784
ag30010
aV every arrangement that you made is about enhancing this life   isn't it 
p30731
aVif this life  could be enhanced from outside 
p30732
aVyou would have done it 
p30733
aVbut this is a realization for you that life cannot be enhanced from outside 
p30734
aVarrangements will bring convenience and comfort 
p30735
aVit ll take care of things for us  around us 
p30736
aVbut it cannot enhance 
p30737
aVif you want to enhance the  life  you have to turn inward 
p30738
aVif you really care for people who are with you  
p30739
aVyour family  your children  
p30740
aVthe foremost thing that you need to do is
p30741
aVyou have to enhance this 
p30742
aVbecause what is the damn best thing that you can do to people around you 
p30743
aVthat you are a wonderful human being 
p30744
aVthere is nothing better you can do to them 
p30745
aVif you had a choice either to live or work with joyful and blissful human beings or
p30746
aVwork and live with miserable human beings 
p30747
aVwhat is your choice 
p30748
ag30030
ag30030
aVi want you to please  please  please remember
p30749
aVeverybody else is looking forward to the same thing  
p30750
aVyou think other people want miserable people 
p30751
ag30018
aVplease just give them that much that you re a joyful human being  
p30752
aVthank you very much
p30753
aVi would like to  i would like to once again acknowledge the dharma foundation
p30754
aVfor the commendable cause that they have taken up 
p30755
aVthis will be an important step
p30756
aVfor preserving and nurturing the future generations in a certain way 
p30757
aVthe significance of this is not to spread another new religion 
p30758
aVthe significance of this  
p30759
aVto create a a religious world
p30760
aVbut still deeply spiritual world 
p30761
aVthis is very important 
p30762
aVthis is very  very important 
p30763
aVthe divide of religions  you see what it is causing 
p30764
aVin the past  it has done terrible things 
p30765
aVstill samples of that happening in many parts of the world 
p30766
aVwhat the religious divide can do 
p30767
aVdon t think you will be or i will be or our children will be immune to this
p30768
aV  anywhere it can flare up  believe me  anywhere 
p30769
aVso this effort is commendable
p30770
aVand in whichever way we can support this 
p30771
aVisha foundation and myself  we will
p30772
aVput our force behind this

aS'sense organs cannot perceive the entirety of anything'

aS'to see this out of my hand'

aS'you cannot see this part of my hand'

aS'even if you take a grain of sand'

aS'if you see one part of it'

aS'you cannot see the other face of it'

p30888
aS'you it is no comepetiion'
p30889
aS'your senses are useless '
p30890
aS'cause that is darkness'
p30891
aS'you know what is like'

aS'otherwise you just would not know what is like'

aS'if light with on all the time and there was no dark'

p30896
aS'if there was no silence '
p30897
aS'not have the idea of what is sin'
p30898
aS'so always in combat'
p30899
aS'it is like'
p30900
aS"let's say you re six feet tall"
p30901
aS'now you walk like a tall man'
p30902
aS'you think like a tall man'

aS'think like a short '

aS'and feel like a short man and you are a short man'
p30909
aS'so what you perceive incompatision is a distortion of reality'
p30910
aS'it is not reality as it is'
p30911
aS'so whatever we perceive in comparison is useful for our saviveltprocess'
p30912

aS'intelligence of it all'

aS'now the fourth dimmonsin of intelligence is callchitar '

aS'is a dimension of intelligence which is unsoliebymamirty'

aS'very intelligent bread'
p31149
aS'it is just the memory that you carry'
p31150
aS'here it is a memory'
p31151
aS'which transforms everything the way is'
p31152
aS'so this dimension of intelligence which is called chitta'
p31153
aS'which is untacheby any kind of memory '
p31154
aS'your intelligence is of significance'
p31155
aS"because it's beyond"

aS'it is beyond your form'

aS'every kind of influence which is essentially memory within new'

aS'may be unconscious '

aS'it is memory playing out in so many ways'

p31170
aS'you are in cycles of life'
p31171
aS'if you re in cycles or if you re going and so'

aS'you re in a cyclical mode'
p31191
aS'it is all right to exercise yourself'

aS"but it's not good to go somewhere so "
p31193
aS'if you want to transcend esonsada nature of who '

aS'then you touch the dimension of intelligence which is effort as tipte'
p31196
aS'why the so all the east and wisdom is of great significance'
p31197
aS'why the pee the east is so significant and important ease'

aS'does not come from a huncea'

p31203
aS'and only that which does not come from your individual identity or individual memory'
p31204
aS'that can be truly universal'
p31205
aS'so for this we said'
p31206
aS'this is a note '

p31208
aS'thats a very long conception'
p31209

aS'when we say nature there is physical nature and there is an inoniture'

aS'accordingly we made two dimensions of loss'

aS'physical nature is a changing thing'

p31225
aS'based on this an entire wisdom arose'

p31589
aS'so in in a certain moment'
p31590
aS'when a done as what'
p31591
aS'is the nature of this true that you re talking about'
p31592
aS'where is it'
p31593
aS'so crisnaw laughed and said'
p31594
aS'the highest truth about your life is at the tip of your nose'
p31595
aS'now there are many schools of yoga intensely focusing on the tips of the '
p31596
ag2415
aS'last slide for two minutes you will get a heavy'
p31597
aS'you will lonatinlike'
p31598
aS'what is saying is it is the most obvious thing it '
p31599
aS'the most obvious thing'
p31600
aS'but right now the problem is'
p31601
aS'all the instruments of perception that you have cuhtoutthewaodbab'
p31602
aS'but the seat of your experience is within you'
p31603
aS'the fundamental seat of your experience within you'
p31604
aS'but all the instruments of perception of outward by '
p31605
aS'how should i do this'
p31606
aS'you must understand'
p31607
aS'anything beyond sir rival if it has to enter yowr life'
p31608
aS'some striving is needed'
p31609
aS"let's say "
p31610
aS'as a little infant'
p31611
aS'you have left in the jungle without human contact '
p31612
aS'something edible came in front of you'
p31613
aS'would you first try your ears'
p31614
aS'then norfellda'
p31615
aS'somehow by accident find your mouth '
p31616
aS'the to'
p31617
aS"you would just know where to put it isn't it"
p31618
aS'to what i am saying is everything that is necessary for saelivbal'
p31619
aS'he s but in to you '
p31620
aS'on it'
p31621
ag2415
aS'five cents a stick care of it'
p31622
aS'but if you want to know something more '
p31623
aS'to strive'
p31624
aS'for example'
p31625
aS'you remember'
p31626
aS'when you of three four or five years of '
p31627
aS'you had to learn to write the alphabet'
p31628
aS'that damn a how complicated it was'
p31629
aS'and they on top of it to torsion '
p31630
aS"you had to write it a hundred times to get it isn't it"
p31631
aS'but today with you '
p31632
aS'so an right'
p31633
aS'if that striving was not dead to '
p31634
aS'would you write'
p31635
aS'so they would you know language'
p31636
aS'so anything beyond saidvivel need striving'
p31637
aS'without the needed striving it won happen'
p31638
aS'there are ways to perceive the interiority of who you are'
p31639
aS'but unfortunately has been no striving '
p31640
aS'right now we made this technology into such a simple '
p31641

p31818
aS"i don't know anything at all "
p31819
aS'to such an extent'
p31820
aS'if somebody gives me a glass of water'

aS'if you re looking for life you look for a drop of water '
p31831
aS'lot of excitement they found a few drops on the mars'
p31832
aS'i think people from californanytomagarate '
p31833
aS'so i m just tearing on this glass of water for hours so in'
p31834
aS'if i found a lily and just looking at the leaf but five six hours of the street'
p31835
aS'if i sit up in my bed staring at the dark '
p31836
aS'then taeonigttam sitting like this daing'
p31837
aS'my dear father being a physician'
p31838
aS'started thinking i need psycetlic evaluation'
p31839
aS'this boy is simply staring at something '
p31840
aS'the unblingingesteringis'
p31841
aS'lost it its '
p31842
aS'problymise i look at this one'
p31843
aS'i still do not know this one'
p31844
aS'there is no way i m able to shift my entered another one'
p31845
ag31544
aS'held my attention i couldn t shift '
p31846
aS'in this condition they sent me to school'
p31847
aS'and my mother said be '
p31848
aS'so the bagters'
p31849
aS'i went and batertantinheeties'
p31850
aS'the kind of attention that there never recibintherlo'
p31851
aS'and initially i understood the words that they were speaking'
p31852
aS'and what they were trying to say '
p31853
aS'to some time i realized the is making sounds'
p31854
aS'i m making up the meanings in my head'
p31855
aS'even now as i speak i m only making sounds'
p31856
aS"you re making up the meanings isn't it"
p31857
aS'because language is a conspiracy between two people '
p31858
aS'if you have a concbenisy what do you do'
p31859
aS'indians you speak in your language '
p31860
aS'and indearyhavethisadgan'

aS"a soldamnonlymakingsamds isn't that"
p31865
aS'you re making up the meanings so '
p31866
aS'i realized i m the one was making up all the menus'
p31867
aS'i stopped making the meanings'
p31868
aS'i just heard the sounds with full attention'
p31869
aS'that is the problem it must be '
p31870
aS'the moment they not understand they think they need not pay attention '
p31871
aS'i do not understand needs more attention'
p31872
aS"than what you understand isn't it"
p31873
aS'so as i watched titoleftetetur coming in and making noises and nices and nice and going'
p31874
aS'it became very amusing to me and a huge smile spread on my face'
p31875
aS'they were not at all amused'
p31876
aS'a my scaling went like this'
p31877
aS'you very consistent'

p31881
aS'on it '
p31882
aS'while have to get to do stuff like that'
p31883
ag2415
aS'so monthly report cards come i see in the school a '
p31884
aS'chilernarwassprutingatrorm ecause they re foshtofssecond'
p31885
aS'some are sitting and crying because they re afraid to go home with their marks card'
p31886
aS'never once in my ndgieswhoollifediteever open and see '
p31887
aS'the teachers gave me the card i took it and gave it to my father'
p31888
aS'i thought the sidtensection be me the two of the '
p31889
aS'i m not the to do with this'
p31890
aS'because i was very consistent'
p31891
aS'always boutsixzeedols '
p31892
aS'or they always gave an empty paper'
p31893
aS'if they insisted i put my name on it'
p31894
aS'otherwise i gave an im as a '
p31895
aS'when the final lictumcame it out something underenderthenexplas'
p31896
aS'otherwise all my tests i got to a a i a '
p31897
aS'because '
p31898
aS'million things in '
p31899
aS'i have a billion questions in my mind about everything'
p31900
aS'there is nobody allournhosecapable of antering thisqurstion'
p31901
aS'but the piano tough something else into you'
p31902
aS'i am not evisteden '
p31903
aS'so school went like this '
p31904
aS'about eight years ago this school '
p31905
aS'i studied nearly forty forty five years ago'
p31906
aS'they came to invite me for their one hundred and twenty fifth anniversity of the school'
p31907
aS'so the test'
p31908
aS'the third delevation of dresties came to invite me'
p31909
aS'they said you must come'
p31910
aS'i said see i was not just a not good student'
p31911
aS'i was not even a student why me '
p31912
aS'you ll call a brilliant students of your school '

p31916
aS'our school is produced folustars'
p31917
aS'you are the only mystic you must come '
p31918
aS'so okay '
p31919
aS'so i went there to speak and '
p31920
aS'and i entered stood up in the courtwangan '
p31921
aS'and the same orbretof buildings'
p31922
aS'then i suddenly remembered this classroom '
p31923
aS's about fifteen years of age'
p31924
aS'one afternoon'
p31925
aS'the teacher is trying to get a response for some question '
p31926
aS'i hear the sounds but i dont hear the words'
p31927
aS'after some time i don t even hear the sounds'
p31928
aS"don't even see their forms "
p31929
aS'see all kinds of things '
p31930
aS'i know their passprehanthandfuture '
p31931
aS'dont know what he s saying'
p31932
aS'i annoiestheentirvelifebetterthemhim'
p31933
aS"but i don't know what he sang"
p31934
aS'and thirty five forty minutes'
p31935
aS'he desperately tried to get a response from me'
p31936
aS'but those days have made like this'
p31937
aS'sometimes brleedeisfortiys i dont at of a word'
p31938
aS'i not because i am in silence or something'
p31939
aS'when you do know anything what you sick'
p31940
aS'this i dont know anything has grown to such a size'
p31941
aS"it's like you know"
p31942
aS'my mind is billions of questions simply'
p31943
aS'i have a question mark about everything in the ones'
p31944
aS'and not a single answer'
p31945
aS'so then after that i five forty minutes he got so free '
p31946
aS'he came and held me by the shoulders shook me wilendlylikethis'
p31947
aS'and he said'
p31948
aS'you must either be the divine or the devil'
p31949
aS'i think you are the latter'
p31950
aS'i did not feel abused by this or insulted by this'
p31951
aS'till then my problem '
p31952
ag2415
aS'this'
p31953
aS'is that what '
p31954
aS'that what is that'
p31955
aS'what is that'
p31956
aS'one thing was clear to me this is me'
p31957
aS'suddenly this guy confused me about this also'
p31958
aS'so the land looked like this '
p31959
aS'i am i'
p31960
aS'i am '
p31961
aS'evil '
p31962
ag31960
aS'he just confused me for the first '
p31963
aS'i thought this was a'
p31964
aS'so i tried to stare at myself '
p31965
aS'and work '
p31966
aS'close mice in his silly manutestoourshitwentdon'
p31967
aS'one day i closed my eyes and sat'
p31968
aS'i thought i sat there for twenty five thirty minutes'
p31969
aS'when i opened my eyes'
p31970

p31979
aS'this have you been sitting here with the deendays'
p31980
aS'in my experience it was only twenty five to ten minutes'
p31981
aS'when i tried to open my legs my knees were stuck'
p31982
aS'it took almost an hour and a half'
p31983
aS'or water'
p31984
ag31520
aS'thing to get my legs straightened out'
p31985
aS'atheuhieven i wondknowbelievtitbuttheinthis had passed'
p31986
aS'in my experience it just felt like twenty five thirty minutes'
p31987
aS'and suddenly what is inside what is outside everything got mixed up'
p31988
aS'clearly till then i was very clear this is me that s you all right'
p31989
aS'and no issue with that one but this is me and that is you '
p31990
aS'in this idea of what is me and what is not me got all mixed up'
p31991
aS'because what is me was just evidebefh'

p31993
aS'that i m just losing you going off my rocker'
p31994

V the most beautiful thing about time is
p32065
aVif you do something it passes by 
p32066
aVif you do nothing it passes by 
p32067
aVif you are joyful it passes by 
p32068
aVif you are miserable it passes by 
p32069
aVits absolutely just no matter who you are
p32070
aVhow you are
p32071
aVfor everyboy it passes at the same speed 
p32072
aVonly thing is our experience of the time could be different
p32073
aVdepending upon how intensely we live
p32074
aVor how slack we are 
p32075
aVif you re very slack with life
p32076
aVit looks like time is passing by very slowly 
p32077
aVif you re very intense 
p32078
aVtime just flies by
p32079
aVbut in reality time is happening to all of us at the same pace 
p32080
aVthese cycles of time
p32081
aVwhether it s minutes or hours or days or months or years that go by 
p32082
ag32081
aVanything that s cyclical is naturally repetitive
p32083
aVbut anything that is cyclical
p32084
aValso has a centrifuge or a centrifugal force 
p32085
aVa force which is always trying to go away at a tangent from the circle 
p32086
aVif you ride this centrifugal force of time 
p32087
aVwe say you re spiritual 
p32088
aVif you are caught up in the cycle of time
p32089
aVthen that s being material 
p32090
aVif you re crushed by the cycles of time
p32091
aVthen we say you are a suffering creature 
p32092
aVit is the same cycle 
p32093
aVeither you can be crushed by the cycle
p32094
aVor you can trapped in the cycle
p32095
aVor you can ride the cycle 
p32096
aVto ride the cycles of time
p32097
aVnot to be trapped in it 
p32098
aVdefinitely not to be crushed by it 
p32099
aVtime is crushing experience for a lot of people 
p32100
aVhmm 
p32101
aVyes 
p32102
aVanything cyclical has this ability
p32103
aVthat it can crush you
p32104
aVor it can trap you
p32105
aVor you can ride it 
p32106
aVin the yogic way of looking at things
p32107
aVwe see time
p32108
aVtime is referred to as kala 
p32109
aVkala means both time and space 
p32110
aVkala means darkness 
p32111
aVdarkness means that which does not stop light 
p32112
aVyou understand what i m saying 
p32113
aVif there is light going by you won t see it 
p32114
aVonly if it s stopped by something you see it 
p32115
aVso that which does not stop light is called darkness 
p32116
aVso that which does not stop light is empty space 
p32117
aVso both space and time are referred to as kala
p32118
aVbecause they are not seen as two different entities 
p32119
aVonly because there is time 
p32120
aVspace is possible 
p32121
aVbecause there is time
p32122
aVyou can move from point a to point b 
p32123
aVso there is space 
p32124
aVif there was no time 
p32125
aVthere was no way to move 
p32126
aVthe general perception is because there is space
p32127
aVthere is time
p32128
aVbut i don t see it that way 
p32129
aVbecause there is time  there is space 
p32130
aVnow
p32131
ag32128
aVwhich happens because of cycles 
p32132
aVthe planet spins once  it s a day 
p32133
aVthe moon goes around the planet  it s a month 
p32134
aVthe planet goes around the sun  here we are today  
p32135
aVthe cycles of time are one dimension of time 
p32136
aVthere s another dimension of time
p32137
aVwhich is not
p32138
aVwhich is beyond the cyclical nature 
p32139
aVthis we call as the great time 
p32140
aVit s called the mahakala 
p32141
aVthere is time and there is greater time 
p32142
aVeven when there are no cycles there is time 
p32143
aVbut where there is no cyclical movement 
p32144
aVthere is no physical happening 
p32145
aVeverything that s physical in the universe
p32146
aVfrom what is atomic to what is cosmic 
p32147
aVeverything is cyclical 
p32148
aVif there are no cycles happening
p32149
aVthere is no physical possible 
p32150
aVwhen i said  if you take a tangent
p32151
aVor if you take the centrifugal to ride away from the cycles of time
p32152
aVthat means being spiritual 
p32153
aVit s in this context
p32154
aVthat we know the cycles of time
p32155
aVonly because of physical reality 
p32156
aVif we could measure
p32157
ag32157
aVwhat is the speed of an electron around the proton and neutron 
p32158
aVwe could keep time 
p32159
aVatomic time 
p32160
aVbut a bit too much for us
p32161
aVso we measured the planets 
p32162
aVhow much time it takes to go around the sun
p32163
aVthey said it s a year 
p32164
aVwe went little further down to days and hours and minutes and seconds
p32165
aVbut all of them are cycles of the physical existence 
p32166
aVif there is no physical existence 
p32167
aVwe would not know anything that s cyclical 
p32168
aVif we did not know what is cyclical movement 
p32169
aVwe would not know the cyclical nature of the time
p32170
aVbut
p32171
aVbefore existence manifested in its physical nature
p32172
aVthere was time 
p32173
aVthis is called mahakala 
p32174
aVthat is  an eternal space 
p32175
aVyou re not watching my words 
p32176
aVi m saying an eternal space 
p32177
aVwhen there was no movement 
p32178
aVwhen everything was still 
p32179
ag32173
aVbut nothing cyclical happening 
p32180
aVthat dimension of time into which everything dissolved 
p32181
aVand from which everything sprang up 
p32182
aVwhen certain energy touched it 
p32183
aVit took to cyclical movement 
p32184
aVwhen cyclical movement happened  physical happened 
p32185
aVwhen physical happened  we could measure time 
p32186
aVotherwise time was just space 
p32187
aVso the word kala means both time and space 
p32188
aV sadhguru we came for a party  
p32189
aVand here you re going at us like this  
p32190
aVis it 
p32191
aVit is important to know or rather
p32192
aVit s important to touch and experience a dimension
p32193
aVwhich is not cyclical in nature 
p32194
aVbecause what is cyclical is inevitably repetitive 
p32195
aVwhat is cyclical inevitably runs itself out at some point 
p32196
aVit runs itself down 
p32197
aVanything that s cyclical cannot be forever
p32198
aVbecause it needs a certain amount of kinetic energy
p32199
aVwhich is going to expend itself 
p32200
aVwhen a human being touches a dimension which is not cyclical in nature 
p32201
aVsuddenly there is a new quality 
p32202
aVa quality which is beyond all qualities  
p32203
aVnot good 
p32204
aVnot bad 
p32205
aVnot this  not that 
p32206
aVsimply 
p32207
aVlike existence 
p32208
aVthere s nothing high about it 
p32209
aVnothing low about it 
p32210
aVit s just that you have moved from the surface to the source 
p32211
aVnot that it solves all your problems 
p32212
aVit s just that you won t know what is a problem  
p32213
aVthis  i said something about the india situation
p32214
aVand this quote is making rounds 
p32215
aVeven reached the prime minister and he was laughing about it 
p32216
aVi said   for every solution there is a problem  
p32217
aVjust see  
p32218
aVfor every solution  somebody has a problem  isn t it  
p32219
aVfor  people may think for every problem there is a solution 
p32220
aVbut when you don t see any problems 
p32221
aVwhen you see only solutions 
p32222
aVsome people have problems with the solutions  
p32223
aVi don't know 
p32224
aV what shall i do 
p32225
aVwhat shall i do with myself
p32226
aVwhich is all and nothing at once 
p32227
ag32226
aVwhich is me and you at once 
p32228
aVwhat shall i do 
p32229
aVis this a problem or is this a solution 
p32230
aVthere may be a space where there are no problems and no solutions 
p32231
aVjust existence 
p32232
aVfor someone who pops out of nothing
p32233
aVand pops out into nothing 
p32234
aVwhat is the problem and what is a solution  i m asking  
p32235
aVhello 
p32236
aVyou popped up from nothing 
p32237
aVyou re gonna pop out into nothing 
p32238
aVin this little space and time 
p32239
aVwhat is the problem and what is the solution 
p32240
aVi want you to figure this out  
p32241
ag32236
aVwhat is the problem 
p32242
ag32101
aV there s really no problem  no solution actually
p32243
aVbut there are so many problems  
p32244
aV sadhguru  we don t know where you are living  
p32245
aVwhere i am living  there are so many problems  
p32246
aVi am also living among the kind of people that you re living with  
p32247
ag32102
aVsame sort  
p32248
aVthe question is just what are you rooted into 
p32249
aVif your rooting is just your physical body 
p32250
aVsome things are problems 
p32251
aVsome things are solutions 
p32252
aVif you re rooted into a psychological framework 
p32253
aVeverything is a problem  
p32254
aVif you re rooted into the existence 
p32255
aVnothing is a problem 
p32256
aVnothing is a solution 
p32257
aVeverything is an experience of life 
p32258
ag32101
aVeverything is an experience 
p32259
aV if i die tomorrow 
p32260
aVthat is also a very good experience 
p32261
aVwe don t wish it tomorrow
p32262
aVbut if it comes  that is also an experience 
p32263
ag32101
aVyou don t like it 
p32264
aVwhether you like it or not  it happens 
p32265
ag32102
aV yes 
p32266
aV whether you like it or not  it happens 
p32267
aVnot that we re wishing it tomorrow 
p32268
aVbut if it happens tomorrow 
p32269
aVwhat the hell  
p32270
aVwe don t want it tomorrow 
p32271
aV still got miles to go before i sleep 
p32272
aVmiles to go before i sleep    
p32273
aVwe don t know how many miles you will go  but
p32274
aVif you look at life in its full depth and dimension 
p32275
aVlife is a certain amount of space 
p32276
aVif you look at life in a linear fashion 
p32277
aVlife is a certain amount of time 
p32278
aVif you look at life from your psychological perspective 
p32279
aVlife is a certain number of problems 
p32280
aVevery day i m meeting all sorts of people 
p32281
aVthousands of them 
p32282
aVhow many varieties of problems they have means it s unbelievable 
p32283
aVfor sure for every solution there is a problem  
p32284
aVbirth is a problem 
p32285
aVdeath is a problem 
p32286
aVin between series of problems 
p32287
aVserial inventors of problems 
p32288
aVone cycle is ending  a new year is coming 
p32289
aVit s a choice that you have to make 
p32290
aVare you going to invest your thought and emotion and energy
p32291
aVin making up problems
p32292
aVor making up solutions 
p32293
aVor simply enjoying life for what it is 
p32294
aVit s a choice that one has to make 
p32295
aV oh  this is my resolution
p32296
aVi won t make any more problems  
p32297
aVto make resolutions  first you need a constitution 
p32298
aVdo you have a constitution 
p32299
ag32236
aVyou don t have a constitution 
p32300
aVno 
p32301
aVlike a nation has a constitution 
p32302
aVa religion has a constitution too 
p32303
aVone advantage of the constitution of the nation is 
p32304
aVwe can amend it periodically 
p32305
aVthe constitution of the religions cannot be amended 
p32306
aVit s fixed  
p32307
aVany change means violence will happen  
p32308
aVif you suggest an amendment  they will kill you 
p32309
aVthat is their amendment  
p32310
aVthe national constitution 
p32311
aVconstitutions which make nations 
p32312
aVit is open to debate and amendment 
p32313
aVi m asking you 
p32314
aVyou as a person 
p32315
ag32299
aVno  no  no  you have 
p32316
aVwhat you like 
p32317
aVwhat you don t like 
p32318
aV this s what i will do 
p32319
aVthis s i won t do 
p32320
aVi m a morning person  i m a evening person  
p32321
aVi m a whatsapp person  i m a e mail person 
p32322
aVi m a facebook person   
p32323
aVthere are constitutions   individual constitutions 
p32324
aVmaybe not written down  but it s there  isn t it 
p32325
aVif you can pass a resolution  there must be a constitution 
p32326
aVif there is no constitution 
p32327
aVhow do you pass a resolution about it 
p32328
aVso there is 
p32329
aVonce you have a constitution  you are not a life 
p32330
aVyou are an institution 
p32331
aVif you re living in an institution  you know what it means  
p32332
aVit means you re a nutcase  
p32333
ag32102
aVno  no  no  not everybody 
p32334
aVeither you re a nutcase or you re a spiritual aspirant  
p32335
ag32102
aVyou are a seeker of sanity
p32336
aVor you re a seeker of liberation  
p32337
aVone of these things means you live in a institution 
p32338
aV so  what resolution should i take for the new year 
p32339
aVall resolutions are impositions 
p32340
aVwhere there is no consciousness 
p32341
aVwhere there is no awareness to know life 
p32342
aVfrom the
p32343
aVfrom the aliveness of what it is 
p32344
aVyou wanna fix it 
p32345
aVif you pass a resolution today 
p32346
aVin some way you re making sure
p32347
aVthat you will not be aware for the next one year 
p32348
aVbecause awareness means a spontaneous response to life 
p32349
aVmoment to moment 
p32350
aVas a  resolution means fixed  pre fixed 
p32351
aVif you pre fix your life 
p32352
aVwhether it s done by you or done by somebody else 
p32353
aVif 
p32354
aVif your government passes a resolution  
p32355
aVall of you must hang upside down
p32356
aVin india we would say a tamarind tree 
p32357
aVhere  where shall we hang you from 
p32358
aVtch 
p32359
aVwhat s the famous tree from which they hang people 
p32360
aVno particular tree 
p32361
ag32101
aVwhere to find a oak tree   
p32362
ag32101
aVwhere to find a big oak tree to hang from 
p32363
aVit s difficult to find them 
p32364
aVin india we say a tamarind tree for a particular reason  
p32365
aVso let s say
p32366
aVyour government passes a resolution that all of you must hang upside down from a tree 
p32367
aVwhatever tree  
p32368
aVwe ll give you the choice of the tree  
p32369
aVwill you suffer this 
p32370
aVwill you protest this 
p32371
aVwill you rebel against it or no 
p32372
ag32101
aV yes
p32373
ag32266
aVwhether your government passes the resolution or you pass the resolution 
p32374
aVit s not any different 
p32375
aVyou re trying to achieve something by force 
p32376
aVanything that you try to do by force
p32377
aVfeels like you re hanging upside down 
p32378
aVyes or no 
p32379
aVyou want to be like this but you want to do this 
p32380
aVyou will feel like you re hanging upside down 
p32381
aVwhen you hang upside down 
p32382
aVyou will feel like rebelling against it 
p32383
aVso naturally 
p32384
aVwithin three days your resolutions will become dissolutions  
p32385
aVotherwise you suffer hanging upside down 
p32386
aVvery few suffer the entire year 
p32387
aVsome will dissolve this in three days 
p32388
aVsome in three weeks 
p32389
aVsome in three months 
p32390
aVbut the very fact that they need one more resolution by the year end is
p32391
aVa proof that did not  did not last the year 
p32392
aVso there is no need to take any resolutions but
p32393
aVa resolution is made because you want to do something
p32394
aVthat you naturally don t  not inclined towards 
p32395
aVbut the simple thing is 
p32396
aVare you naturally inclined to be joyful or miserable 
p32397
aV joyful 
p32398
aV that was only five people  
p32399
ag32397
ag32398
aV the little ones 
p32400
ag32398
aV so  you can consciously
p32401
aVyou can make an attempt to be conscious
p32402
aVthat joyful is my natural inclination 
p32403
aVso how joyful will i be in the coming year 
p32404
aVjust keep accounts 
p32405
ag32101
aVsee  lot of people who re doing business 
p32406
aVthey think they re keeping accounts only for the sake of irs  
p32407
aVno  no 
p32408
aVyou keep accounts not for the sake of irs 
p32409
aVbecause if you do not keep accounts 
p32410
aVyou do not know whether you re making profit or loss 
p32411
aVthat s the idea of accounts  isn t it 
p32412
aVwhether you re moving forward or backward 
p32413
aVto know this 
p32414
aVyou need an account book 
p32415
aVwhy don t you keep an account book 
p32416
aVat the end of the day  just check 
p32417
aV am i little more joyful today than yesterday 
p32418
ag32359
aVif you had done this since you were five years of age 
p32419
aVyou would have been ecstatic by now 
p32420
aVprofit side  
p32421
aVbecame like this because you never kept accounts 
p32422
aVone day you checked when it became very acute 
p32423
aVthen you see you are in a big loss  
p32424
aVevery day 
p32425
aVevery month  just keep accounts 
p32426
aV am i becoming more joyful or less joyful 
p32427
aVthere re only two things 
p32428
aVhow joyful are you
p32429
aVand how much joy do you give to people around you 
p32430
aVthis you can keep accounts 
p32431
ag32101
aVif you keep accounts of this 
p32432
aVpeople are keeping accounts of their money 
p32433
aVas if they re gonna carry it with them 
p32434
aVthe real wealth of life is how joyful you are 
p32435
aVhow wonderful is your experience of life 
p32436
aVjoy is not a goal by itself
p32437
aVbut it s a necessary ambiance for life 
p32438
aVif you don t set this one ambiance 
p32439
aVthen whatever you have is just going waste 
p32440
ag32101
aVyou may have health  that s going waste 
p32441
aVbecause  there are more people on this planet
p32442
aVwho re healthy and miserable
p32443
aVthan unhealthy and miserable 
p32444
aVat least if you re
p32445
aVat least if you re unhealthy  you got a good enough excuse
p32446
aVfor your misery 
p32447
ag32101
aVyou re healthy and miserable  there is no excuse 
p32448
aVi want you to just understand this 
p32449
aVit s just not smart to be miserable  
p32450
ag32101
aVthis happened
p32451
aVa lady was driving 
p32452
aVtch and then she had a flat tire 
p32453
aVshe had never really done this  
p32454
aVthis changing tire business
p32455
aVbut she read the instruction manual 
p32456
aVshe put the jack and lifted up the car 
p32457
aVshe undid the wheel 
p32458
aVwith great difficulty she pulled out the heavy wheel from the boot
p32459
aVand was trying to fix it
p32460
aVand these four nuts that she had 
p32461
aVshe had kept it in the hub cap
p32462
aVand with her high heels she was struggling
p32463
aVand she stepped on the hub cap
p32464
aVand all the four nuts flew in different directions 
p32465
aVso she put the new tire  but she had no nuts 
p32466
ag32359
aVthen she was cursing and wondering and miserable 
p32467
aVwhat the hell to do now 
p32468
aVand she was little nervous
p32469
aVbecause she was hearing all kinds of noises from a mental institution
p32470
aVwhich was across the street  
p32471
aVthen on the third floor 
p32472
aVthere was a young man looking out of the window 
p32473
aVwatching this lady 
p32474
aVthen he said 
p32475
aV hey lady  look here 
p32476
aVall you need to do is 
p32477
aVtake one one nut out of the three wheels
p32478
aVand put the three nuts on this 
p32479
aVyou can drive to the gas station 
p32480
aVwith three nuts you can drive  no problem 
p32481
aVshe did that 
p32482
aVand she got the car down on the road 
p32483
aVthen she looked up at him and said 
p32484
aV you re so smart  why are you here  
p32485
aVhe said   i may be nuts but i m not stupid   
p32486
aVit s all right to be little crazy 
p32487
aVbut you don t have to be stupid 
p32488
aVall the so called smart people who ve become  
p32489
aVlike they re practicing a posture for their grave   you know 
p32490
aVwhen i look at lot of people 
p32491
aVi think they re practicing  
p32492
aVthey re doing pretty well  
p32493
aVbut what they don t understand is 
p32494
aVit doesn t take practice 
p32495
aVwhen you die  it happens  
p32496
ag32102
ag32266
aV do you think you need to practice 
p32497
aVno  
p32498
aVbecause you can t improve death with practice
p32499
aVbut you can improve life with practice 
p32500
ag32379
ag32266
aV however you do life 
p32501
aVyou can still do it better 
p32502
ag32102
ag32266
aV but death happens super efficiently for everybody 
p32503
aVyou can t improve upon that 
p32504
aVyou think you can improve 
p32505
ag32301
aVyou don t have to practice your final posture right now  
p32506
aVit ll come naturally  believe me 
p32507
aVit s not like life  there re no difficulties there 
p32508
aVit ll come very naturally 
p32509
aVyou will do perfectly well in the grave  
p32510
aVyou don t have to have any doubt 
p32511
aVit doesn t need any preparation 
p32512
aVwhen you die  you will get it 
p32513
ag32101
aVbut now with life 
p32514
aVthere is so much to do and more 
p32515
aVhow much ever you do 
p32516
aVthere s something more to do about life  isn t it 
p32517
aVif you want to be at it 
p32518
aVthe fundamental ambiance is that you re joyful 
p32519
aVotherwise  you will get this tremendously intelligent idiotic question  
p32520
aV to be or not to be   
p32521
ag32102
aVintellectually seems very profound 
p32522
aVbut it s the most idiotic question 
p32523
aVyou don t have to decide not to be 
p32524
aVit will happen 
p32525
aVthere were many idiots like you 
p32526
aVcountless number of idiots like you on this planet who re gone 
p32527
aVthey don t have to worry about to be or not to be now 
p32528
aVanyway they re not to be 
p32529
aVthis is our time on this planet 
p32530
ag32102
ag32266
aV this is our time on this planet 
p32531
aVwhat are we going to do 
p32532
aVthat s the question 
p32533
aVare we going to make this into an exuberant 
p32534
aVjoyful 
p32535
aVwonderful planet 
p32536
aVor we going to make this into a miserable 
p32537
aVhorrible planet 
p32538
aVthis is our time 
p32539
aVwe are free to do either way 
p32540
aVthe choice is yours 
p32541
aVi won t tell you 
p32542
aV take a resolution that you will make this into a wonderful planet 
p32543
aVthere is no such thing 
p32544
aVthe natural inclination of life is for pleasantness 
p32545
aVif you choose to be very pleasant within yourself 
p32546
aVpleasant things will happen 
p32547
aVif you re feeling horrible within you 
p32548
aVand you try to do wonderful things 
p32549
aVthen  i want you to understand  
p32550
aVthe worst tyrants on the planet 
p32551
aVthose who topped the baddie list historically
p32552
aVi ll pick up the worst of the lot 
p32553
aVyou take somebody like adolf hitler or benito mussolini 
p32554
aVthey really believed
p32555
aVthey are going to create a wonderful world 
p32556
aVyou know this 
p32557
aVthey had a dream of an ideal world 
p32558
aVwhen you have horrible things going within you
p32559
aVand you go at the world with very energetically 
p32560
aVwhat you will create is a horrendous reality 
p32561
aVbefore you touch the world 
p32562
aVif you want to clean somebody s face 
p32563
aVyour hands must be clean  isn t it 
p32564
ag32379
ag32266
aV your hands are not clean 
p32565
aVyou try to touch this  
p32566
aVthis s not gonna work 
p32567
aVso before you touch the outside world 
p32568
aVthis much you must do to with yourself that you are pleasant 
p32569
aVwhen you are pleasant 
p32570
aVwhatever you touch will become pleasant 
p32571
aVyou are unpleasant 
p32572
aVbut you have good intentions 
p32573
aVit is no good 
p32574
aVi want you to understand 
p32575
aVright now in the world 
p32576
aVone situation that is happening in certain parts of the world 
p32577
aVwhich almost everybody in the world sees
p32578
aVas the most horrible things that can happen 
p32579
aVthey believe they re creating god s own kingdom 
p32580
ag32379
ag32266
aV they one hundred percent believe 
p32581
aVyou may question their intelligence 
p32582
aVyou cannot question their integrity
p32583
aVbecause they re willing to die for it 
p32584
aVwhen a man is willing to die for something 
p32585
aVyou cannot question his integrity  isn t it 
p32586
aVyou can question his intelligence and judgment 
p32587
aVbut you cannot question his integrity
p32588
aVbecause when i stake my life 
p32589
aVyou must know i mean it   isn t it 
p32590
aVi m not playing fool with it 
p32591
aVit means more to me than my life 
p32592
ag32379
ag32266
aV i want you to know  you have anger and hatred going within you
p32593
aVbut you want to create a wonderful world  
p32594
aVwhat happens 
p32595
aVthe consequence of that is a horrendous reality 
p32596
aVit s not by intention that the world will change 
p32597
aVit is by your consciousness that the world will change 
p32598
aVhow you are within yourself 
p32599
aVif we don t fix this one thing 
p32600
aVwe will have intentions and intentions 
p32601
aVthe worst things have happened on the planet with good intentions 
p32602
aVnot with bad intentions 
p32603
ag32379
ag32266
aV the most horrendous things have happened with very good intentions 
p32604
aVso what intention you have is not important 
p32605
aVwhat is your inner nature 
p32606
aVthis is important 
p32607
aVevery action that humanbeings are doing in their life
p32608
aVknowingly or unknowingly
p32609
aVis in pursuit of their well being 
p32610
aVand you know you feel well only when you are joyful
p32611
aVhello
p32612
ag32102
aVyou feel really well only when you are joyful isn't it 
p32613
aVor in other words 
p32614
aVevery single action that human beings perform
p32615
aVis in pursuit of their happiness or joy 
p32616
aVif they were joyful by their own nature 
p32617
aVevery action that you perform would become conscious
p32618
aVinstead of being compulsive  isn t it 
p32619
aVthis is all you have to do to yourself 
p32620
aVthis year 
p32621
aVthe coming year 
p32622
aVand the coming  coming year and for the rest of your life 
p32623
aVyou just have to keep accounts 
p32624
aVfrom yesterday to today 
p32625
aVam i little more joyful 
p32626
aVam i 
p32627
aVyou don t even have to worry about giving joy 
p32628
aVif you re joyful  you will spread joy 
p32629
ag32102
aVwill you keep accounts  i m asking 
p32630
ag32373
aV or shall i set irs upon you  
p32631
aVdo you need enforcement  
p32632
aVmost societies have been run for a long time by enforcement 
p32633
aVso if there s nobody to enforce   
p32634
ag32301
aVthat s not what happens 
p32635
aVif there is nobody to enforce anything 
p32636
aVyou become joyful  isn t it  
p32637
aVi want you to understand this  
p32638
aVthe different between a resolution
p32639
aVand moving towards the natural inclination of life 
p32640
aVif there is nobody enforcing anything upon you 
p32641
aVdo you become miserable or joyful 
p32642
ag32398
aV so  you don t have to enforce any resolutions upon yourself 
p32643
aVjust little tools to make sure that you don t sink 
p32644
aVjust keeping accounts 
p32645
aVdaily 
p32646
aVevery day before you go to bed 
p32647
aVyou must check
p32648
aVwhether you re little more joyful today than yesterday  okay 
p32649
aVif you keep this up 
p32650
aVby the time you re thirty 
p32651
aVyou will be ecstatic  
p32652
aVwhen i was  
p32653
aVwhen i was just twenty five 
p32654
ag32359
aVi simply sat down with my eyes closed 
p32655
aVevery cell in my body was dripping ecstasy 
p32656
aVnameless ecstasies 
p32657
aVthen i realized this is it 
p32658
aVnothing to be done 
p32659
aVif you don t mess with your mind 
p32660
aVyou re ecstatic 
p32661
aVthe fool that i was  i made a plan  
p32662
aVin two and a half to three years  time 
p32663
aVi m going to make the entire world ecstatic
p32664
aVbecause there s nothing to do 
p32665
aVif you simply sit here   you know 
p32666
aVthirty five years   
p32667
aVi have not lost it 
p32668
aVa few people have gotten it 
p32669
ag32102
aVquite a few people have gotten it 
p32670
aVbut still not the world  
p32671
aVmaking some estimates and 
p32672
aVon an average 
p32673
aVin the last three years  time
p32674
aVwe should be touching nearly hundred million people a year 
p32675
aVbut still that s not the world  
p32676
aVno  no  no don t  don t 
p32677
aVdon t enjoy my failures  
p32678
aVmy idea of the world is 7 3 billion people 
p32679
aVtch
p32680
aVhundred million is not a success 
p32681
aVit looks like i m destined to die a failure
p32682
aVbut i ll die a blissful failure
p32683
aVbecause me being blissful is not dependent upon the results of my actions
p32684
aV 
p32685
aVmy actions are rooted in my blissfulness 
p32686
aVthis is how life needs to be conducted 
p32687
aVthat your actions are rooted in your joyfulness and blissfulness 
p32688
aVthat joy is not a result of something that you do 
p32689
aVthe moment it is a result of something that you do 
p32690
aVit will fly away in no time
p32691
aVbecause our actions in the world 
p32692
aVnot always are they successful 
p32693
ag32101
aVhowever well you do it 
p32694
ag32379
ag32694
ag32693
aVour actions are subject to various realities 
p32695
aVmany forces have to come together for the success of any action 
p32696
aVnot always they will fall together 
p32697
aVso if your joy 
p32698
aVif your way of being is enslaved to the success of your activity 
p32699
aVthen you being joyful is a very remote possibility 
p32700
aVand above all 
p32701
aVwhat will happen is 
p32702
aVwhen you perform actions 
p32703
aVif they don t succeed 
p32704
aVif you re going to become miserable
p32705
aVafter a couple of burns 
p32706
aVthen you will shrink 
p32707
aVyou will see how to restrict your life to minimal activity so that
p32708
aVyou will enjoy maximum success 
p32709
aVif you cripple yourself  you know 
p32710
aVif you cripple yourself 
p32711
aVyou can participate in a race with people 
p32712
aVsuppose you have only one leg 
p32713
aVthen you participate in a race
p32714
aVwith somebody who does not have both the legs
p32715
aVand of course you win 
p32716
aVthis is what most people are trying to do 
p32717
aVthe moment there is fear of suffering 
p32718
aVof failure 
p32719
aVwhat you will do is cripple yourself 
p32720
aVrestrict your activity 
p32721
aVonly when failure doesn t matter 
p32722
aVthat you can go through your failure blissfully 
p32723
aVyou will do everything that you can do 
p32724
aVwho cares whether it happens or not 
p32725
aVwe will do it and we ll do it well 
p32726
aVif it happens  it s great 
p32727
aVif it doesn t happen  it s very great
p32728
aVbecause we can do it all over again  
p32729
aVjoy is not a consequence of life or activity of life 
p32730
aVjoy is a natural ambiance which is necessary
p32731
aVif you have to 
p32732
aVtomorrow morning if you have to wake up
p32733
aVand want to do something 
p32734
aVyou no  you need to have some joy in you  
p32735
aVotherwise  to be or not to be   
p32736
aVwill it come or not 
p32737
aVsuppose you wake up and you 
p32738
aVtomorrow morning you re bereft of joy 
p32739
aVnothing in you 
p32740
aVyou ll wonder   why am i here 
p32741
ag32379
aVone day  one twenty four hours completely joyless 
p32742
aVwill you wonder 
p32743
aV what the hell i m doing here 
p32744
ag32379
ag32266
aV because this is the nature of life 
p32745
aVif this life has to blossom 
p32746
aVit needs the ambiance of joy 
p32747
aVso  we have given you the tools  to live joyfully 
p32748
aVyou must keep accounts 
p32749
ag32101
ag32266
aV  yes  
p32750
aVi got it  
p32751
aVbefore they serve food and music is ready and the party is ready 
p32752
aVi don t want to take any more time 
p32753
aVif there is a question that you can't go into the new year
p32754
aVwithout being answered 
p32755
aVif there is such a question   okay 
p32756
aVnot that you must ask a question 
p32757
aVif there is such a question  okay 
p32758
ag32301
aVit works only if you speak  
p32759
aV namaskaram sadhguru 
p32760
aV mhmm  
p32761
aV i have thousands of burning questions 
p32762
aVbut i thank you immensely for giving me this opportunity to ask one question 
p32763
aVhow do i get rid of some unconscious bad habits in my life 
p32764
aVwhen i see that i have overcome some of those bad habits 
p32765
aVi see that it comes back again in my life 
p32766
aVhow do i just totally get rid of this and become free out of it
p32767
aV see  you must understand that  please
p32768
aVthere is no such thing as good habit and bad habit 
p32769
aVall habits are bad  
p32770
aVbecause habit means you re unconscious 
p32771
aVyou think only bad habits are unconscious 
p32772
ag32301
aVeven the so called good habits 
p32773
aVhabit means you have learned to function in an automated way 
p32774
aVthat means you don t do things consciously 
p32775
aVfor example 
p32776
aVis brushing your teeth in the morning
p32777
aVa good habit or a bad habit  
p32778
aVeven you 
p32779
aVi thought you would be free from a habit  
p32780
aVthere are two ways of brushing your teeth 
p32781
aVbecause you ve been regimented to brush your teeth 
p32782
aVyou get up and ffff  
p32783
aVor because you wake up 
p32784
aVyou re very sensitive 
p32785
aVif you open your mouth 
p32786
aVyou re conscious enough 
p32787
aVmost of the time 
p32788
aVyou re not conscious enough 
p32789
aVonly other people know  
p32790
aVthis is a very strange thing 
p32791
aVthere is the apparatus 
p32792
aVthe olfactory apparatus 
p32793
aVwhich smell  which have a sense of smell  right here  
p32794
aVabove your mouth  
p32795
aVbut you don t get it 
p32796
aVothers get it five feet away  
p32797
aVthat means you re unconscious  isn't it 
p32798
ag32102
ag32266
aV if you re conscious you would still brush your teeth 
p32799
aVtill you come to such a place 
p32800
aVwhen you open your mouth in the morning
p32801
aVit smells like fragrance  you become like a flower 
p32802
aVtill that happens 
p32803
aVyou must consciously brush  
p32804
aVif you consciously brush 
p32805
aVon different days
p32806
aVor different mornings
p32807
aVit may need different length
p32808
aVor different amount of brushing 
p32809
aVnot every day  brushing is same requirement 
p32810
aVbut because you re regimented 
p32811
aV three minutes  i must wear my teeth out  
p32812
aVif you were conscious 
p32813
aVon a particular day you would brush as it is necessary for that day 
p32814
aVthat s how it should be 
p32815
aVon a particular day 
p32816
aVyou would eat as it is necessary for the body 
p32817
aVyou would sleep as it is necessary for the body 
p32818
aVyou would do everything consciously 
p32819
aVbut now  it's a habit 
p32820
aVeverything is a habit 
p32821
aVwhat time you should go to bed 
p32822
aVwhat time you should wake up 
p32823
aVwhat you should eat 
p32824
aVwhat you should not eat  
p32825
aVeverything by prescription 
p32826
aVthis is called slavery 
p32827
aVyour doctor tells you
p32828
aVor your slave master tells you what you should eat today 
p32829
aVi don t see what's the difference 
p32830
aVwhy is it that you do not know
p32831
aVwhat this body needs today 
p32832
aVbecause no consciousness 
p32833
aVeverything by regimentation 
p32834
aVby habit 
p32835
aVhabit is regimentation  isn't it 
p32836
aVit's only by regimentation you become habitual 
p32837
aVso in this  you have also identified something as good habit
p32838
aVand something as bad habit 
p32839
aVwhat to do 
p32840
aVis there something called as bad unconsciousness
p32841
aVand good unconsciousness 
p32842
aVthat s what you re saying 
p32843
aVwhen you say   i have a good habit 
p32844
aVyou re saying   i m unconscious in a nice way   
p32845
aVit's like   saying 
p32846
aV i m dead in a nice way   
p32847
aVbecause the fundamental difference
p32848
aVbetween being alive and being dead is
p32849
aVbeing conscious and being totally unconscious 
p32850
aVbeing partially unconscious is being partially dead 
p32851
aVas i earlier told you 
p32852
aVyou re trying to practice the posture 
p32853
aVand the state of what it means to be dead 
p32854
aVdo not fix any kind of habit 
p32855
aVjust see
p32856
aVsee  the idea of withdrawing into retreats 
p32857
aVcoming to a spiritual space is just this  
p32858
aVto find space where you can do everything consciously 
p32859
aVwhen you were in a race 
p32860
aVyou could not be conscious 
p32861
aVyou got mad
p32862
aVand you somehow fixed some habits
p32863
aVthrough which you managed to go through your daily office routine 
p32864
aVwhen you come to a spiritual space 
p32865
aVthis is what you re supposed to do  
p32866
aVthat you watch what is the requirement of your body 
p32867
aVwhat is the requirement of your mind 
p32868
aVwhat is the requirement of your emotion 
p32869
aVwhat is the requirement of your energy 
p32870
aVwhat does this life  need 
p32871
aVwhat does it naturally long for 
p32872
aVto consciously watch this 
p32873
aVonce you consciously know that this is what it is longing for 
p32874
aVthen there is no two ways about it 
p32875
aVotherwise  you think you re on the spiritual path because of me 
p32876
aVthat s a crime against me  
p32877
aVyes  
p32878
aVif you re unconscious  it s a crime against yourself 
p32879
aVbut you re doing something that you think is spiritual
p32880
aVbecause of me 
p32881
aVthat s a crime against me 
p32882
ag32359
aVyou better do crime against yourself  not against me  
p32883
aVso  how do i get rid of habits 
p32884
aVyou don t have to get rid of habits 
p32885
aVit is like
p32886
aVwhat you re asking is 
p32887
aV how do i get rid of my unconsciousness 
p32888
aVwhen you use the word  un 
p32889
aVwe are suggesting a non existence 
p32890
aVnot an existence  isn't it 
p32891
aVconsciousness is 
p32892
aVwhen consciousness is not there 
p32893
aVthat is called un consciousness 
p32894
aVhow to get rid of something that does not exist 
p32895
aVi m saying you re playing a trick with yourself 
p32896
aVit's like 
p32897
aVsuppose this  this hall is dark 
p32898
aVhow to get rid of this darkness 
p32899
aVkick it out 
p32900
ag32101
aVall of you together  i m sure you can kick out of the darkness 
p32901
aVyou will get into an insane effort 
p32902
aVyou ve been on it 
p32903
ag32101
aVthis insane effort to get rid of unconsciousness 
p32904
ag32301
aVto get rid of darkness  you just have to light it up 
p32905
aVif you light it up 
p32906
aVdarkness is gone
p32907
aVbecause darkness is not an existence by itself 
p32908
aVit's just the absence of light 
p32909
aVsimilarly  unconsciousness is not an existence of itself 
p32910
aVit is just absence of consciousness 
p32911
aVif you become conscious 
p32912
aVdo you have to fight with unconscious 
p32913
ag32101
aVif you re conscious 
p32914
aVdo you have to fight with unconscious habits 
p32915
aV no 
p32916
aV no  so you need to work on consciousness  to become conscious 
p32917
aV oh  what should i do 
p32918
aVyou should not do unconscious things  
p32919
aVbecause the essence of life is being conscious 
p32920
aVyou know that you re alive only because you re reasonably conscious  isn't it 
p32921
ag32379
ag32266
aV you re fast asleep 
p32922
aVdo you know you re dead or alive 
p32923
aVdo you know 
p32924
ag32916
ag32916
aVwhy  because you re not conscious 
p32925
aVwhen you re not conscious 
p32926
aVyou do not even know whether you re dead or alive  isn't it 
p32927
aVnow you know that you re alive
p32928
aVbecause you re somewhat conscious 
p32929
aVnow  we just have to raise the wick a little bit to become more conscious 
p32930
aVthat s what we re working on 
p32931
aVthere are many things  which has gathered inertia 
p32932
aVyour physical body
p32933
aV30 drum in the morning 
p32934
aVyour mind has got into its own habitual patterns
p32935
aVthat s why me torturing you with all this 
p32936
aVyour energies have followed the requirement of body and mind
p32937
aVand they ve gotten into their own patterns  
p32938
aVthat is why the sadhana 
p32939
aVthe idea is to break the cycles of unconsciousness and become conscious 
p32940
aVwhen you become conscious 
p32941
aVit looks like you re in unknown terrain 
p32942
aVsuddenly everything seems to be difficult 
p32943
aVwhen you were going habitually  it looked like everything was easy but
p32944
aVsee  when i 
p32945
aVwhen i went into the coimbatore prison
p32946
ag32301
aVi went there unqualified  you know  
p32947
aVwhen i went there to conduct a program  
p32948
aValmost twenty five  twenty four  twenty five years ago 
p32949
aVi just observed  
p32950
aVthis is something a whole lot of people are seeking in their life 
p32951
aVprison life 
p32952
aVbecause this is a place where somebody always opens the doors for you
p32953
aVand they close it for you 
p32954
aVthey turn off the lights for you 
p32955
aVthey do everything for you 
p32956
aVyou don t have to do anything   really 
p32957
aVfood comes bang on time   always 
p32958
aVby the second  i m telling you 
p32959
aVtun means food is ready 
p32960
aVeverything is great in this prison 
p32961
aVi thought this is a great place 
p32962
aVonly thing is it's enforced 
p32963
aVbut this is what a whole lot of people are seeking
p32964
aVsystems in their life 
p32965
ag32102
aVwhen it is done to you  you will suffer it  i m telling you  
p32966
aVwhen it is done to you  you ll suffer it 
p32967
aVactually  for a whole lot of people 
p32968
aVprison life is far more
p32969
aVit is far more organized  what they dream of in their life 
p32970
aVit's far more efficient 
p32971
aVfar more nutritious 
p32972
aVand most of them are very fit and healthy 
p32973
aVbut if you enter the prison 
p32974
aVthere is suffering in the air 
p32975
aVnot once   i have been there hundreds of times to various prisons  
p32976
aVnot once have i stepped out of the prison without tears in my eyes because
p32977
ag32975
aVthe pain in the air is unbearable 
p32978
aVbecause one thing that a human being suffers most is lack of freedom  
p32979
aVnot lack of comfort 
p32980
aVnot lack of wealth 
p32981
aVnot lack of this and that 
p32982
aVonce freedom is taken away 
p32983
aVa human being suffers immensely 
p32984
aVeverything is correct 
p32985
aVprison life is far more comfortable than going to work and coming back 
p32986
aVgetting stuck in the traffic 
p32987
aVgoing through all these problems 
p32988
aVyou are a state guest  you know  
p32989
aVreally 
p32990
aVif you re looking for a comfortable 
p32991
aVno surprises kind of life 
p32992
aVif you suffer every little thing  sh
p32993
aVeverything shocks you 
p32994
aVeverything makes you go through stress and tension 
p32995
aVprison life is perfect  
p32996
aVeverything is in order 
p32997
aVno surprises 
p32998
aVeverything is just right 
p32999
aVeven the menu is written down  
p33000
aVnext seven days  what's the menu 
p33001
aVit's there and it goes by that 
p33002
aVnothing more  nothing more  nothing less 
p33003
aVone bean more means somebody will be taken to task  
p33004
ag32985
aVthose who are looking for a correct life 
p33005
aVprison is the best place  
p33006
aVbut a human being will suffer immensely when everything is correct 
p33007
ag32379
ag32266
aV everything is correct but no freedom  
p33008
aVpeople will suffer this immensely 
p33009
aVso  you need to understand 
p33010
aVhabit means you have caused a little prison of your own
p33011
aVand you will suffer this after some time 
p33012
aVinitially  it looks like efficiency 
p33013
aVafter some time 
p33014
aVit is imprisonment 
p33015
aVprison is in many ways an epitome of efficiency  isn't it 
p33016
aVbut efficiency is not what this life  is looking for 
p33017
aVthis life  is looking for expansion 
p33018
aVthis life  wants the freedom to expand  always 
p33019
aVi was talking to one of this management specialists from america 
p33020
aVa very well known man  
p33021
aVlet me not mention the names 
p33022
aVso  he was propounding all his management principles 
p33023
aVwhich if
p33024
aVwhich looked like a prison cell to me  
p33025
aVbringing order to everything 
p33026
aVso that it's efficient 
p33027
aVsee  there are two ways of looking at this 
p33028
aVthere is a manicured garden  which looks very perfect 
p33029
aVthere is forest  which looks like chaos 
p33030
aVbut the manicured garden 
p33031
aVif you don t manage it for one month  it s finished 
p33032
aVthere s no garden left 
p33033
aVa forest has managed itself for a million years
p33034
aVand still going on 
p33035
aVwhich is more efficient 
p33036
aVwhich is more orderly 
p33037
aV forest 
p33038
aV forest is far more orderly and far more efficient 
p33039
aVbut it is not fitting into your logical framework  that s all 
p33040
aVthis is what enlightenment means 
p33041
aVthat from being a manicured garden 
p33042
aVyou become a forest because
p33043
aVit sustains upon itself 
p33044
aVit doesn t need anything from outside 
p33045
aVnobody need to water it 
p33046
aVnobody need to manure it 
p33047
aVnobody need to come and trim it 
p33048
aVeverything happens within itself 
p33049
ag32379
ag32266
aV if you leave it for a million years it ll still be there 
p33050
aVonly if you meddle with it  it may go away 
p33051
aVotherwise  it will sustain itself because it is an efficiency of chaos 
p33052
aVwe call something chaos not because it is inefficient 
p33053
aVwe call something chaos because it doesn t fit in to our logical framework 
p33054
aVso habit means you have become a slave of your own logic
p33055
aVand after some time
p33056
aVthe moment you form a habit 
p33057
aVit is unconscious  isn't it 
p33058
aVso  what you need to get rid of is not habits 
p33059
aVyou have to become conscious 
p33060
aVif you become more conscious and you re not unconscious 
p33061
aVthen there is no such thing as habit 
p33062
aVyou will do what's right for you now 
p33063
aVso  nine hundred and ninety nine questions 
p33064
aVplease live with it for 2017  
p33065
aVall the best 
p33066
ag32760
aVthank you so much for this opportunity

p33068
aVand i wanted to know like if we read the book
p33069
aVas i ve read it and i m doing the practices 
p33070
aVthe practices in the book 
p33071
aVhow do they help versus the programs that we have
p33072
aVand if someone s reading the book and doing the practices 
p33073
aVis that enough
p33074
aVor what is that they need to do next

p33095
aVthere s a poem
p33096
aVthey re going to recite 
p33097
aV my heart is like a singing bird whose nest is in a watered shoe 
p33098
aVmy heart is like an apple tree 
p33099
aVwhose boughs are bound by thick sap fruit 
p33100
aVmy heart is like a rainbow show that paddles in the sea 
p33101
aVmy heart is gladder than all these because my love has come to me 
p33102
aVraise me days of silk and down 
p33103
aVcovered in peacocks and doves and pea  pomegranates and peacocks with one hundred eyes 
p33104
aVwork it in gold and silver grapes and leaves and silver firty 
p33105
aVbecause the birthday of my life has come 
p33106
aVmy love has come to me  
p33107
aV  what a sweet poem  
p33108
aV i m sorry  
p33109
aVyou know  we re washed away by 
p33110
aVwe lost the question  you know  
p33111
aVokay  okay  practices  practices  
p33112
aV if only  if i get to do that 
p33113
aVthat would be amazing  
p33114
ag33093
aV that was lovely  the kids getting to hug you 
p33115
aVit was amazing  
p33116
aV hmm  what is that 
p33117
aV the kids getting to hug you was amazing  you know 
p33118
aVso it s okay 
p33119
aV but you don t have a sweet poem like her  
p33120
aVoh  when you said the book  you know i m supposed to finish this book before 3rd of january 
p33121
aVso i m working on that book 
p33122
aVwhen you said   the book   
p33123
aVi was just thinking book  book  book
p33124
aVbecause this book is bothering me for last few days 
p33125
aVi m supposed to complete it by 3rd january  
p33126
aVwe re writing a book on adiyogi 
p33127
aVi m to give it to the publisher by 3rd january and 
p33128
aVso that s the book on my mind 
p33129
aVyou re talking about the old book  
p33130
aVold book 
p33131
aVokay  
p33132
aVthe practice that is taught in the inner engineering program needs twenty one minutes 
p33133
aVyou need to sit in one place and do it 
p33134
aVit is of a different nature 
p33135
aVit is 
p33136
aVit is a process which can change 
p33137
aVto start with 
p33138
aVthe chemistry of your system 
p33139
aVmany of you have experienced this 
p33140
aVafter a few months of practice 
p33141
aVif you look back and see 
p33142
aVall those little little things which were so significant
p33143
aVdon t seem to bother you anymore 
p33144
aVthey re just gone 
p33145
aVsimply because the chemistry has changed 
p33146
aVyou know when chemistry changes  things change  
p33147
aVin whatever way you have known it 
p33148
aVbut there are other dimensions to human chemistry
p33149
aVthat instead of being a volatile reactive chemistry 
p33150
aVcan become a very self contained chemistry
p33151
aVwhich is pleasant and on 
p33152
aVthe practices in the book are not
p33153
aVsitting down and doing practices 
p33154
aVyou could be doing it anywhere 
p33155
aVyou could be driving 
p33156
aVyou could be working in your office 
p33157
aVyou could be walking on the street
p33158
aVand still be doing it 
p33159
aVthey re of that nature 
p33160
aVor in other words  the practices in the book are
p33161
aVjust to bring a certain amount of consciousness 
p33162
aVthe book did not have these practices to start with 
p33163
aVbut when i travelled around in america 
p33164
aVeverybody was talking about being mindful  
p33165
aVthen i saw 
p33166
aVby being mindful what they will do to themselves 
p33167
aVmy entire work is to bring you to a certain sense of abandon
p33168
aVthat you can be here like you re not here 
p33169
aVif you sit here 
p33170
aVyou don t even know whether your body is here 
p33171
aVif you sit like this 
p33172
aVfirst thing is you don t have a gender 
p33173
aVyou don t even have a body 
p33174
aVso where is the question of a gender 
p33175
aVif you simply sit like this 
p33176
aVthere is no time for you 
p33177
aVjust look at this 
p33178
aVonly because you have a body 
p33179
aVyour body is keeping time 
p33180
ag32101
aVyour legs are telling you how long you ve been sitting 
p33181
aVyes or no  
p33182
ag32101
ag32266
aV suppose you had no legs 
p33183
aVyou would have no sense of time 
p33184
aVif you had no back 
p33185
aVno sense of time at all 
p33186
aVif you had no body  no time at all  isn t it 
p33187
aVyour body is keeping time from womb to tomb it is keeping time 
p33188
aVfrom bathroom break to bathroom break it is keeping time 
p33189
aVfrom wakeup to sleep it is keeping time 
p33190
ag32379
ag32266
aV once it s time  it ll do aaaaa  
p33191
aVyou don t have to look at the watch 
p33192
aVonce a certain time is up 
p33193
aVyour body will do aaaaa 
p33194
ag32379
aVright now  you ve seen that old time machines with sand trickling away 
p33195
aVlike that the bladder is keeping time  
p33196
aVdrop  drop  drop 
p33197
aVas it fills up 
p33198
aVyou know what s the time 
p33199
aVlegs are keeping the time 
p33200
aVif you d done your practices regularly 
p33201
aVi mean the  tch the program practices 
p33202
aVnot the book practices 
p33203
aVif you d done the program practices regularly 
p33204
aVyour legs can deceive time 
p33205
aVyou 
p33206
aVyour legs don t know what s the time 
p33207
aVyour legs know  
p33208
aVbook  book practice  
p33209
aVso  the program practices are of a different nature
p33210
aVthat cannot be transmitted
p33211
aVunless a certain amount of preparation and 
p33212
aVit s a transmission 
p33213
aVit s not a teaching 
p33214
aVbook is a teaching 
p33215
aVthere is a big difference between teaching and transmission 
p33216
aVdo not misunderstand both as one 
p33217
aVthis is a way of creating a smaller step for people 
p33218
aVbecause people are not willing to take one big step 
p33219
aVone small step 
p33220
aVthey read the book and if some small things change 
p33221
aVthey may take the program 
p33222
aVbut there is no substitute for sitting properly with eyes closed
p33223
aVand doing what is being done properly
p33224
aVand not only that 
p33225
aVthere is no substitute for a transmission 
p33226
aVif something is not transmitted 
p33227
aVnothing new till happen 
p33228
aVimprovement of the present will happen 
p33229
aVnothing new will happen 
p33230
aVwith shambhavi we are not looking at improving you 
p33231
aVwe want something new to sprout in you 
p33232
aVsomething that was never there with you till that moment must happen within you 
p33233
aVthat s the intent 
p33234
aVthe book is trying to decorate the
p33235
aVexisting 
p33236
aVwhatever you are right now  to make a little improvement 
p33237
aVmost people are looking for improvements in life 
p33238
aVthey are not looking for transformation 
p33239
aVtransformation means nothing of the old should remain 
p33240
aVthat s transformation 
p33241
aVbut most people cling to the old 
p33242
aVwill you leave 2016
p33243
aVor will you carry it with you 
p33244
ag32101
aVcan you 
p33245
aVthough it leaves you  you will not leave it  
p33246
aV2016 will leave you  but you will not leave 2016  isn t it 
p33247
ag32266
aV because you are a creature of memories 
p33248
aVif you are a creature of memories 
p33249
aVyou are a creature of the past 
p33250
ag32101
aVthat means you are a dinosaur which is extinct  
p33251
aVyou ve become big because of your memories  isn t it 
p33252
aVbut you re extinct 
p33253
ag32359
aVwhat is the use 
p33254
aVdinosaur was a big creature  but doesn t exist 
p33255
aVwhat is the use i m asking 
p33256
aVlike this if you live in your memory 
p33257
aVyou are big  but what is the use 
p33258
aVwhat is needed is to reverberate with what is there now 
p33259
aVmemory is good to handle the world 
p33260
aVit s good only to handle the world 
p33261
aVit s no good to handle this one   isn t it 
p33262
aVdo you understand what i m saying 
p33263
aVmemory is good to handle the world around us 
p33264
aVwe need to remember what happened  
p33265
aVwhat happened with this person 
p33266
aVwhat happened with that person 
p33267
aVwhat happened with that situation and this situation 
p33268
aVwe need to remember 
p33269
aVit is useful to address the world 
p33270
aVbut with your silly memory 
p33271
aVyou cannot address this one 
p33272
aVit doesn t mean anything 
p33273
aVthis one you can address only with consciousness 
p33274
aVthere is no other way 
p33275
aVotherwise you won t have this one 
p33276
aVyou have assembly of things 
p33277
aVsee  let me address something very sensitive 
p33278
aVi want you to listen to this carefully otherwise you ll come to wrong conclusions 
p33279
aVlet s say somebody very dear to you dies 
p33280
aVor they go away for some reason 
p33281
aVyou feel like you lost everything 
p33282
ag32379
aVyou feel like you lost everything
p33283
aVbecause you are making up a life of substitution 
p33284
aVwhere you are not there 
p33285
aVyou filled it up with other people 
p33286
aVwhen they go away  there is vacuum 
p33287
aVbut that s not how life is happening 
p33288
aVbecause you are there 
p33289
aVonly because you are there 
p33290
aVyou can hold relationships with people  isn t it 
p33291
ag32236
ag32266
aV but now in your experience you are not there 
p33292
aVbecause you are a creature of memory 
p33293
aVyou can only remember this one and that one and that one 
p33294
aVyou can t remember this one 
p33295
aVhow can you remember this one 
p33296
aVbecause this is a current life 
p33297
aVyou cannot remember this one 
p33298
aVbecause you re handling everything by memory 
p33299
aVyou will see
p33300
aVwhen one volume of memory which was a certain person or a situation 
p33301
aVif that goes away 
p33302
aVit feels like life has come to an end 
p33303
aVsimply because
p33304
aVa certain amount of investment you ve made in a certain amount of memory you have about a specific person 
p33305
aVso if you live by memory 
p33306
aVi m saying 2016 will leave you but you will not leave 2016 
p33307
aVif you don t leave 2016 
p33308
aVhow do you go to 2017 
p33309
aVyou cannot 
p33310
aVyou drag all these years and go into 2017 
p33311
aVthere s no such thing 
p33312
aVyou will be on a treadmill 
p33313
aVyou ll get the exercise but you won t go anywhere 
p33314
aVtreadmill is fine if the weather is bad  
p33315
aVbut it s not a vehicle to go somewhere 
p33316
aVthis much you must understand 
p33317
aVmemory is a treadmill 
p33318
ag32102
ag33318
aVit is all right to handle situations around us
p33319
aVbut you re not going to go anywhere with it 
p33320
aVbut human beings have invested so much in their memory 
p33321
aVthere s hardly a handful who will go with me on this one 
p33322
ag32359
aVi m asking 
p33323
aVhow many of you really want to step into 2017 
p33324
aVfully  leaving 2016 behind 
p33325
aV yeah  yes 
p33326
aV whoa  whoa  whoa  
p33327
aVif you really  if really  really i m saying 
p33328
aVif you can leave the past as past  completely 
p33329
aVif you can sit here just in the present 
p33330
aVno past 
p33331
aVyou re enlightened  you know 
p33332
aVthat s all it takes 
p33333
aVit s the burden of the past
p33334
aVwhich doesn t let you flower into a full possibility 
p33335
aVjust the burden of the past 
p33336
aVso this is a good moment 
p33337
aVthis is not something that the planet is doing  okay 
p33338
ag32359
aVyes the solstice has just happened 
p33339
aVthat is there 
p33340
aVbut every day planet is spinning 
p33341
aVevery day it is moving 
p33342
aVin the trajectory of the planetary movement around the sun
p33343
aVyou can choose any point to get enlightened 
p33344
aVyou don t have to wait for this point  
p33345
ag32379
aVbut anyway we are at this point
p33346
aVwhere somewhere in your mind you ve been told it is significant 
p33347
aVit s only significant because there is a memory of 2016 
p33348
aVif there is no memory of 2016 
p33349
aVin what way there is a 2017 
p33350
ag32544
aVno  no  this is
p33351
aV sadhguru  you re confusing us  
p33352
aVsixteen 
p33353
ag33353
aVseventeen  
p33354
aVit s correct  arithmetically correct 
p33355
ag32102
aVbut only because there is memory 
p33356
aVthere is sixteen and there is seventeen  isn t it 
p33357
ag32266
aV so if you know how to simply sit here
p33358
aVwithout being burdened by your memory 
p33359
aVwithout being a product of memory 
p33360
aVwhen i say product of memory  
p33361
aVyour likes 
p33362
aVyour dislikes
p33363
aVwhom you love 
p33364
aVwhom you don t love 
p33365
aVwho is your friend 
p33366
aVwho is your enemy 
p33367
aVall this comes because of your memory  isn t it 
p33368
aVif you can keep all that aside
p33369
aVand let the new year blossom 
p33370
aVyou will blossom into a wonderful creature 
p33371
aVspraying fragrance into the world 
p33372
aVwell 
p33373
aVthere won t be any attendant music
p33374
aVnor will there be an applause 
p33375
aVbut if really beautiful things happen who cares
p33376
aVwhether it is appreciated by somebody  or not  
p33377
aVhey 
p33378
aVwhere is the attendant music 
p33379
aVwhat happened to the musicians  
p33380
aVcome on 
p33381
aVnothing so wonderful happened 
p33382
aVso let s have some music  
p33383
aVwhat 
p33384
aV what is this 
p33385
aVwhat did you say 
p33386
aV isha home school
p33387
aV  i have no such mission 
p33388
aVit s for the parents to decide where they want to send their children 
p33389
ag32101
aV so what do you want to do with them  eh  
p33390
aV oh  you re thinking of starting a school here 
p33391
aV yes  yes 
p33392
aVso many children
p33393
aV look at that one  
p33394
aV she is a missionary  i m not  
p33395
aVanyway 
p33396
aVjust to tell you a few things 
p33397
aVone thing is 
p33398
aVon february twenty fourth is a once in a lifetime kind of event for isha
p33399
aVthat we re unveiling this hundred and twelve feet tall face of adiyogi
p33400
aVin coimbatore
p33401
aVin the isha yoga center in india 
p33402
aVit s going to be a massive campaign 
p33403
aVparticularly in india
p33404
aVbut even internationally there will be a certain level of campaign 
p33405
aVthe fundamental idea is to use this iconic face as a galvanizing force  
p33406
aVas i said the book is getting ready  
p33407
aVto use it as a galvanizing force
p33408
aVto move people  
p33409
aVit s a dangerous thing to say in tennessee  
p33410
aVto move people from religion to responsibility 
p33411
aVwhy i m saying this is  
p33412
aVhumanity has become like this 
p33413
aVif small things go wrong in their life 
p33414
aVthey will find one little guy to blame   
p33415
aV because of him 
p33416
aVif big things go wrong in their life 
p33417
aVthey ll find that big guy   
p33418
ag33416
aVwhat about this guy  
p33419
aVsome of the studies show that on an average all indian rivers are depleting by eight percent per year 
p33420
aVthat means in about fifteen to twenty years 
p33421
aValmost all the rivers which have been perennial will become seasonal
p33422
aVfor variety of reasons 
p33423
aVso for the last three years i ve been working on this
p33424
aVand we ve come up with a kind of a  a policy that the government has to take up 
p33425
aVwe ve worked with a couple of state governments
p33426
aVwhich they re already trying to implement 
p33427
aVi ve managed to convince two chief ministers and make this happen 
p33428
aVi ve recently put this across to the prime minister
p33429
aVand he s agreed to this in principle 
p33430
aVbut to raise this awareness across the country
p33431
aVbecause most people are unaware of it completely 
p33432
aVso 
p33433
aVand also
p33434
aVit s been a long time since i drove across the country 
p33435
aVso  we re driving from leh ladakh which is the ta  northernmost tip of india
p33436
aVto kanyakumari
p33437
aVand back on the east coast
p33438
aVand back to delhi 
p33439
aVtotally about 12 000 kilometers 
p33440
aVabout sixteen major events will happen on the way 
p33441
aVso those of you who can drive in india 
p33442
aVbecause it takes a different level of skill 
p33443
aVif you wish to be a part of that 
p33444
aVwe will do this rally of a certain number of people 
p33445
aVsome can ride on a electric bus 
p33446
aVrest can drive 
p33447
aVthere ll be probably two or four electric busses
p33448
aVand maybe twenty five to fifty cars 
p33449
aVin each segment 
p33450
aVlot more will join
p33451
aVbut this complete trip will be approximately twenty five cars and two busses probably 
p33452
aVit ll be finalized later
p33453
aVbut there will be major events in all the cities
p33454
aVto raise the awareness about the rivers in india 
p33455
aVso we want to involve the entire population in the cities 
p33456
aVthere ll be rivers you know
p33457
aVriver related quizzes for the children 
p33458
aVpeople will run for the rivers 
p33459
aVpeople will cycle for the rivers 
p33460
aVpeople will do all kinds of things
p33461
aVfor rivers on that day
p33462
aVwhen the event comes to that city 
p33463
aVand above all to make a policy document
p33464
aVand when we come back to delhi 
p33465
aVwe re having a conference where we present this
p33466
aValong with the chief ministers of many states
p33467
aVwe re going to sign a river accord
p33468
aVas to what the policy should be about rivers 
p33469
aVeven now 
p33470
aVdifferent states are fighting with each other for river waters 
p33471
aVnot realizing that in another fifteen twenty years 
p33472
aVthere may be nothing to fight about  
p33473
ag32102
aVit s a serious situation 
p33474
aVso this is going to happen 
p33475
aVif some of you wish to participate in this 
p33476
aVit s going to be an incredible experience of
p33477
aVdriving across the length and breadth of india 
p33478
aVwhich is by any standards
p33479
aVthe most colorful nation on the planet  
p33480
aVchaotic  but colorful  
p33481
aV it should take about twenty five days 
p33482
aVanywhere between twenty to twenty five days  i think 
p33483
aV hmm  i m sorry 
p33484
aV    about the school  
p33485
aVespecially in    
p33486
aV she s gonna do it anyway  so 
p33487
aVi m not against it but i m not for it either  
p33488
aVi m definitely not against it
p33489
aVbut i know what it takes to run a good school 
p33490
aVit s not about buildings 
p33491
aVgetting the right people with
p33492
aVlong term commitment
p33493
aVto well being of children
p33494
aVwho may not be theirs but
p33495
aVwhen you have children who are not yours 
p33496
aVyou have to do much more than what you would do with yours 
p33497
aVi need people like that who are willing to do a lot more with somebody else s children
p33498
aVthan they would do with their own 
p33499
aVif there are such people 
p33500
aVa school will come together anyway  
p33501
aVif you live by this silly standard of what is yours and what is not yours 
p33502
aVanyway you will live in a very small space on this planet
p33503
aVand in this cosmos 
p33504
aVif you have no sense of what is yours and what is not yours 
p33505
aVeverything will be open to you

aVthat s my blessing to you  
p33507

aS'you could not be conscious'
p34329
aS'you made'
p34330
aS'you somehow fixed some habits'
p34331
aS'through which you managed to wodreofdailyofficeroping'
p34332
aS'when you come to a pitatoupace'
p34333
aS'this is what you re supposed to do '
p34334
aS'that you watch what is the requirement of your body'
p34335
aS'what is the requirement of your mind'
p34336
aS'what is the equarment of her emotion'
p34337
aS'what is the requirement of your energy'
p34338
aS'or does this life need'
p34339
aS'what does it naturally long for '
p34340
aS'to consciously watch this'
p34341
aS'once you consciously know that this is what it is longing for'
p34342
aS'then that is not always about it'
p34343
aS'otherwise you think you are of this villagtofbatebecause '
p34344
aS'me that s a crime against me'
p34345
ag2415
aS'if you re unconscious is a clam against yourself '
p34346
aS'but you re doing something that you think is ilritul'
p34347
aS'because of me'
p34348
aS'thats a climagansme'
p34349
ag2415
aS'i do crime against yourself not against me'
p34350
aS'so how do i get in of habits'
p34351
aS"you don't have to get rid of habits it "
p34352
aS'like '
p34353
aS'what you re asking is'
p34354
aS'how do i get rid of my unconsciousness'
p34355
aS'you use the word un'
p34356
aS'he is suggesting a non exist '
p34357
aS"not an existence isn't it"
p34358
aS'consciousness ease'
p34359
aS'when consciousness is not there '
p34360
aS'that is all unconsciousness'
p34361
aS'how to get id of something that does not exist on '
p34362
aS'i am saying you re playing a trick with yourself '
p34363
aS"it's like "
p34364
aS'as this this all is dark '
p34365
aS'how to get rid of this does '
p34366
ag33588
ag2415
aS'all of you to me that i m sure you benkikot the docknass'
p34367
aS'you get into an insane effort '
p34368
aS'one '
p34369
ag2415
aS'this insane effort to get rid of unconsciousness'
p34370
ag34102
aS'the richard of darkness you just have to lighted up '
p34371
aS'i would like it up '
p34372
aS'ducnesses gone'
p34373
aS'because darkness is not an existence by itself '
p34374
aS'just the absence of light '
p34375
aS'similarly unconsciousness is not an existence of itself '
p34376
aS'it is just absence of consciousness'
p34377
aS'if you become conscious'
p34378
aS'do you have to fight with unconscious'
p34379
ag2415
aS'if you re conscious'
p34380
aS'you have to fight with unconscious habits'
p34381
ag2415
aS'so you need to work on consciousness to become conscious'
p34382
aS'or what should i do '
p34383
aS'you should not do unconscious things '
p34384
aS'because the essence of life is being conscious'
p34385
aS'you know that you re alive only because you re reasonably conscious desenten'

aS'do not even know whether you get at alive ascentit'
p34393
aS'now you know that you re life'
p34394
aS'because you re somewhat conscious'
p34395
aS'now we just have to raise the wick a little bit to become more conscious'
p34396
aS'that s what we working off '

aS'when you become conscious'

aS'i just obsoved'
p34416
aS'this is something a whole lot of people are seeking in their life '
p34417

p34418
aS'because this is a place who have somebody always opens the door '

aS'this is what a whole lot of people are seeking is '

aS'in that lie '
p34431
ag2415
aS'when it is done to you you in hefelitdontelingu '
p34432
aS'when it when it is done to you you will suffer it '

p34434
aS'prison life is far more'

p34437
aS'for mornotoshies'
p34438
aS'and most of them are very fit an heal '
p34439
aS'but if you enter the prison '
p34440
aS'he is suffering in the air'
p34441
aS'not once have been there hundreds of times a wariouspresens'
p34442
aS'not one i stepped out of the prison without tears in my eyes because'
p34443
aS'there is suffering in the air the pain'
p34444
aS'in the air is unbearable'
p34445
aS'because one thing that a human being suffers most is lack of freedom'
p34446
aS'not lack of comfort'
p34447
aS'not lack of wealth '
p34448
aS'not lack of this and that'
p34449
aS'once freedom is taken away '
p34450
aS'human being suffers immensely '
p34451
aS'everything is gone'
p34452
aS'prison life is far more comfortable than going to work and coming back '
p34453
aS'i stuck in the trafag'
p34454
aS'going to all this problems'
p34455
aS'you are a state guest and '
p34456
aS'really'
p34457
aS'if you re looking for a comfortable'
p34458
aS'no surprises kind of life '
p34459
aS'if you suffer every little thing'
p34460
aS'everything shocks you '
p34461
aS'thing makes you got a stress intention'
p34462
aS'and life is perfect '
p34463
aS'thing is in order '
p34464
aS'rises'
p34465
aS'everything is just drag '
p34466
aS'the man us '
p34467
aS'nextsepenieswatcsthemanu'
p34468
aS'there i posed by that'
p34469
aS'in more nothing more nothing less'
p34470
aS'one bean more means somebody will be taken to gas '
p34471
aS'thing is correct'
p34472
aS'does we are looking for the core life '
p34473
aS'prison is the best place'
p34474
aS'but a human being will suffer immensely when everything is correct '
p34475
aS'yes ted '
p34476
ag2415
aS'thing is correct but no freedom'
p34477
aS'people will suffer this immensely'
p34478
aS'so you need to understand '
p34479
aS'habit means you have caused a little prison of your own'
p34480
aS'and you and suffer the eftersuntime'
p34481
aS'initially looks like efficiency'
p34482
aS'after some time'
p34483
aS'it is impresentmenti'
p34484
aS'prison is in many is an epitomofveficciencyliit'
p34485
aS'but efficiency not what this life is looking for this'
p34486
aS'life is looking for expansion this'
p34487
aS'life wants the freedom to expand always'
p34488
aS'i was talking to one of this management species from america'
p34489
aS'a very well on man '
p34490
aS'not mention the names '
p34491
aS'so he was sprubounding all his management principles'
p34492
aS'of'
p34493
aS'which look like a prison cell to me'
p34494
aS'bringing order to everything '
p34495
aS'lusufficien'
p34496
aS'so that the two ways of looking at this '
p34497
aS'that is a manicured garden which looks very parent'
p34498
aS'is forest which looks like chaos'
p34499
aS'but the manicagode'
p34500
aS"if you don't managed for one man it's finished"
p34501
aS'a nogatelefe'
p34502
aS'forest has managed itself for a million is and'
p34503
aS'and going on '
p34504
aS'it is more efficient'
p34505
aS'which is more orderly'
p34506
ag33723
aS'forest is far more orderly and far more efficient'
p34507
aS'but it is not fitting into your logical framework that a '
p34508
aS'this is what enlightenment means'
p34509
aS'that from being a menicorgoden'
p34510
aS'you become a forest because'
p34511
aS'it sustains upon its house'
p34512
aS"it doesn't need anything from outside"
p34513
aS'in it to what of it'
p34514
aS'nobody need to me '
p34515
aS'it nobody need to come and cement'
p34516
aS'everything happens within a tall '
p34517
aS'is a '
p34518
ag2415
aS'if you leave it for a million years it ll still be there '
p34519
aS'only if you meddle with it it may go away'
p34520
aS'otherwise it in sustain its half because it is an efficiency of chaos'
p34521
aS'we call something chaos not because it is inefficient'
p34522
aS'we call something chaos because it doesn t fit in to our logical framework'
p34523
aS'so habit means you have become a slave of your own logic'
p34524
aS'and after some time'
p34525
aS'the moment you fall a habit'
p34526
aS'it is unconscious sent '
p34527
aS'so what you need to get rid of is not habits'
p34528
aS'you have to become conscious'
p34529
aS'if you become more conscious and you re not unconscious'
p34530
aS'there is no such thing as habit'
p34531
aS'you will do what it to you now '

aS"don't seem to bother you any "

aS'it s gone '

aS'simply because the chemistry has changed'
p34610

aS'in order but where you have one '
p34612
aS'but there are other that mentions to human chenestry'
p34613
aS'that instead of being olotilereactive chemistry'
p34614
aS'become a very self contained chemistry'
p34615
aS'which is pleasant and on '
p34616
aS'practices in the book are not '
p34617
aS'sitting down and doing practices'
p34618
aS'you could be doing it anywhere'
p34619
aS'i could be driving '
p34620
aS'you could be working in your office you '

aS'be doing it there '

aS'in other words the practices in the book are'
p34625
aS'just to bring a said in amount of consciousness'
p34626
aS'the or did not have these practices to start with'
p34627
aS'but when i travelled around in america '
p34628
aS'i was talking about being mindful'
p34629
aS'then i saw '
p34630
aS'being mindful what they will do to themselves '
p34631
aS'and to work is to bring you to a certain sense of abandon'
p34632
aS'that you can be here like you re not here '

V the business of introducing sadhguru jaggi vasudev 
p34986
aVwho s been described in many different ways in my profession 
p34987
aVby people from my profession 
p34988
aVwe ve called you a maverick  
p34989
aVwe ve called you a monk on a motorcycle 
p34990
aVwe ve called you a glamorous  flamboyant guru
p34991
aVbut for your devotees you are simply sadhguru 
p34992
aVand yet sadhguru 
p34993
aVat a time when
p34994
aVfaith seems to be in collision with
p34995
aVso many other questions that come up as a matter of individual liberty 
p34996
aVi think this will make for a very interesting and important conversation for our times 
p34997
aVso i would like to thank you for being part of this conversation 
p34998
aVlet me start with the spiritual
p34999
aVand i hope what you say today is also addressed to the skeptics 
p35000
aVi count myself among a skeptic 
p35001
aVwho if told that another human being possesses some sort of godly power 
p35002
aVi would perhaps as the first instinct  not believe it
p35003
aVbut what i find interesting about what you ve s
p35004
aVsome of your sayings  as captured by arundhati subramaniam in this book 
p35005
aVis that you re actually saying that
p35006
aVwhat we experience beyond our five senses 
p35007
aVanything that we experience beyond the five senses can be called god 
p35008
aVcan be called power or can be called yourself 
p35009
aVso if god doesn t necessarily exist 
p35010
aVwhy do we need gurus 
p35011
aVwhy do we need sadhguru  
p35012
aV do you drive in delhi 
p35013
aV do i drive 
p35014
aV mhmm  
p35015
aV unlike you 
p35016
aVi have a fear of wheels  
p35017
aV so if you drive in an unknown terrain
p35018
aV yes 
p35019
aV  you use these days a gps 
p35020
ag35019
aV usually  a strange woman will tell you 
p35021
aV turn right  you turn right 
p35022
aVshe says   turn left   you turn left 
p35023
aVshe says   make a u turn  you make a u turn  
p35024
aVwhy 
p35025
aVsimply because you are
p35026
aVyou re not familiar with the terrain 
p35027
aVwhen you are in an unfamiliar terrain 
p35028
aVit is sensible to take instructions  
p35029
aV so are you
p35030
aVare you saying gurus are the new gps  
p35031
aV not new  not new 
p35032
aVlong time ago we ve been  
p35033
aVfor a very long time  way before the gps came  
p35034
aVgps means what   guru positioning system  
p35035
aV but you know  i have to say that while i don t drive 
p35036
aVi ve often sat in the car and heard that girl s voice on google maps
p35037
aVand often google maps
p35038
aV you can actually  you can actually
p35039
aV  does not  does not adv
p35040
aVdoes not give you the right advice 
p35041
aV you can change it to a man s voice if you wish 
p35042
aV okay  
p35043
aVthis beginning of this conversation perhaps underlines that you are atypical 
p35044
aVyou are atypical of what we imagine gurus to be 
p35045
aVwe expect people who don t crack jokes 
p35046
aVwe expect people who don t have a zest for life 
p35047
aVsomehow  all of our spirituality has traditionally been centered around giving up 
p35048
aVaround abstinence of some kind 
p35049
aVaround abstaining from pleasures 
p35050
aVfrom denying creature comforts 
p35051
aVwhy do you believe that the material can co exist with the spiritual 
p35052
aV it s  it s not that i believe 
p35053
aVit s only because you have a body which is your physicality 
p35054
aVyou have a life within 
p35055
aVif you did not have a body 
p35056
aVif you re disembodied 
p35057
aVi m not going to talk to you 
p35058
aVbecause with disembodied beings you don t have conversations  okay 
p35059
aVi know people
p35060
aV people do talk to ghosts 
p35061
aV people are trying to do that these days  
p35062
aVbecause they re not on talking terms with the living  
p35063
aVthey choose the dead 
p35064
aVbecause you can make the dead speak whatever you want 
p35065
aVthe living will speak what they want  it s a big problem  
p35066
aVit s a very serious problem in a conversation
p35067
aVbecause i will say what i want to say
p35068
aVif i was dead  you can make me say whatever you want to say 
p35069
aV but can an
p35070
aV because you can do both sides of the conversation 
p35071
aV but if your philosophy
p35072
aVyou hate the word philosophy i know
p35073
aVif your technology of inner engineering
p35074
aVand we ll talk more about that in just a moment
p35075
aVis available to all of us to  in a sense find strength within ourselves 
p35076
aVsadhguru 
p35077
aVthen does that mean that the atheist and the agnostic and the skeptic
p35078
aVcan also embrace spirituality 
p35079
aVis inner engineering only for those who believe
p35080
aVor is it for anyone  who asks questions 
p35081
aV the previous question is a loaded one  still not answered fully 
p35082
aV yes  i know   i haven t
p35083
aVi haven t given up on it yet  
p35084
aV coming to this 
p35085
aVsee you re putting atheists and agnostics and skeptics together
p35086
aVit s a wrong classification 
p35087
aVatheists and theists are together  they re one kind 
p35088
aV because they both have certainty 
p35089
aV both  both believe something that they do not know 
p35090
aVboth are not sincere enough to admit that they do not know 
p35091
aVthis is the biggest problem 
p35092
aVthe biggest problem in the world is
p35093
aVpeople are still not straight enough to come to a place 
p35094
aV what i know i know  what i do not know i do not know 
p35095
aVbecause they have not realized the immensity of  i do not know 
p35096
aV i do not know  is the basis of longing to know
p35097
aVand seeking to know and the possibility of knowing 
p35098
aVthe moment you destroy  i do not know 
p35099
aVyou destroyed all possibilities of knowing 
p35100
aVso this is atheism and this is theism 
p35101
aVthey re not different 
p35102
aVthey re in the same boat 
p35103
aVthey pretend to be different 
p35104
aVone believes positively 
p35105
aVanother believes negatively
p35106
aVbut they both believe something that they do not know 
p35107
aVone  person  a well known person in the country
p35108
aVwho goes about claiming he s an atheist all the time 
p35109
aVone day comes up to me 
p35110
aVsomebody just introduces me first time 
p35111
aVi said  namaste'
p35112
aVhe says   do you know  i believe there is no god 
p35113
aVi said   i don t even believe that   
p35114
aV do you mean javed akhtar  
p35115
aV i  i m not
p35116
aV that was a good imitation 
p35117
aVso i guessed   it wasn t difficult 
p35118
aV i am not  taking names 
p35119
aVi am saying the thing is you also believe something 
p35120
aVyou don t seem to understand that 
p35121
aVthe most important thing is to come to this place of
p35122
aVbeing utterly straight and sincere with life  
p35123
aVwhat i know i know  what i do not know i do not know 
p35124
aVif you come to this much 
p35125
aVif you closely pay attention to everything around you 
p35126
aVyou will see with all this scientific exploration 
p35127
aVwe do not know even a single atom in its entirety 
p35128
aVthat s the fact 
p35129
aV so what is it that you know sadhguru  
p35130
aVwhy are millions of people your devotees
p35131
aVbecause you just said that honesty 
p35132
aV they usually don t
p35133
aV  is about admitting
p35134
aV they  they don t claim that they are my devotees  you know 
p35135
aV what do they say then 
p35136
aV hmm 
p35137
ag35136
aV usually they claim they re meditators 
p35138
aVvolunteers  and stuff  
p35139
aV okay  volunteers then  
p35140
aVbut there must be something they think that you know
p35141
aVbecause you just said that life is actually about admitting what you don t know 
p35142
aVthe corollary to that is there are things that you do know 
p35143
aVwe do know we re sitting at the habitat center amphitheatre at this moment in delhi  
p35144
aVthat we know 
p35145
aVwhat beyond this sadhguru  do you know and what do you not know  
p35146
aVi ve asked you like is there a question of
p35147
aV now  what do i know 
p35148
aVi don t know anything except this one  
p35149
aVi know this piece of life from its origin to its ultimate 
p35150
aVeverything that i need to know about this life  i know 
p35151
aVand i see every other life is actually the same thing 
p35152
aVif you look deep enough 
p35153
aVso in that context 
p35154
aVbecause today modern science is coming to this 
p35155
aVthere is a  a theory which is evolving 
p35156
aVwhich is called as constructional theory
p35157
aVwhat they are beginning to say is
p35158
aVwhether it s an amoeba or a grasshopper or a earthworm
p35159
aVor a bird or an animal or an elephant or you or me
p35160
aVor the whole cosmos 
p35161
aVthe fundamental design is same 
p35162
aVit is only a question of complexities and sophistication of the same design 
p35163
aVso this is something always the yogic science has been saying 
p35164
aVthat if you know  you know anda you know pindanda   you know 
p35165
aVif you know the atomic  you know the cosmic
p35166
aVbecause the fundamental design is same 
p35167
aVit s only a question of complexity and sophistication of what s happening 
p35168
aVso fundamentally  if you know this piece of life 
p35169
aVyou know everything by inference 
p35170
aV but when you say this piece of life  do you mean yourself 
p35171
aVdo you mean this moment 
p35172
aVwhat do you mean by this piece of life 
p35173
aV you are a piece of life  aren t you 
p35174
aVare you life or
p35175
aVare you media  
p35176
aV are they mutually exclusive 
p35177
aV are have  mediums 
p35178
aVthat s why i m saying  
p35179
aV i would hope i m a flesh and blood person
p35180
aVunless somebody knows better  
p35181
aV flesh and blood you gathered  isn t it 
p35182
ag35019
aV what you call as my flesh and blood 
p35183
aVyou slowly gathered over a period of time 
p35184
aVif this much accumulation of flesh and blood 
p35185
aVthis much impressions have to be gathered 
p35186
aVthere must be something more fundamental  isn t it 
p35187
aV do you think of yourself as a yogi  a mystic or a guru 
p35188
aV i ve not wasted time thinking about myself  
p35189
aV what would you rather be thinking of 
p35190
aV i don t think usually 
p35191
aVreally 
p35192
aVfor me  see th  this whole thing 
p35193
aVbecause of the type of very mediocre education that s being delivered today 
p35194
aVwe have raised thought to heaven unfortunately 
p35195
aVthought is a simple thing 
p35196
aVi know this is against everything that you believe in
p35197
aVbecause you are also a believer  
p35198
aV no 
p35199
aV believer in thought 
p35200
aV yeah 
p35201
ag35019
aV i believe in being able to ask questions 
p35202
ag35019
aV that s what i do for a living 
p35203
aV oh   that s good 
p35204
aV so i must believe that it is possible to ask questions 
p35205
aV you  you ask questions for a living 
p35206
aVmy life is full of questions  
p35207
aVnow  now the thing is what you call as thought
p35208
aVis coming from the limited data that you have gathered from the experience of your life 
p35209
aVevery person is the same thing 
p35210
aVhow much ever we have gathered 
p35211
aVit s still too small compared to the size of this cosmos
p35212
aVand the way the phenomena of life is happening 
p35213
aVfrom this limited da  data 
p35214
aVyou can recycle things and generate thought 
p35215
aVor in other words 
p35216
aVnothing new ever happens 
p35217
aVsame permutations and combinations of the same thing will go on forever 
p35218
aVthe essence of what we re teaching in the name of inner engineering is
p35219
aVto engineer yourself in such a way 
p35220
aVevery moment of your life is a new possibility 
p35221
aVif it has to become a new possibility 
p35222
aVwhat is needed is perception 
p35223
aVwhen i say perception  people think opinions 
p35224
aVno  i am talking about perception 
p35225
aVas you see here  
p35226
aVsimilarly enhancing your perception so that you perceive life 
p35227
aVright now when we say thought  emotion 
p35228
aVwe re talking about expressing life 
p35229
aVexpression is not so important 
p35230
aVonce in a way we can express
p35231
aVbut perceiving it is important
p35232
aVbecause this phenomena is too fantastic 
p35233
aVit s not a small thing 
p35234
aVthe greatest phenomena that s happening here is life itself 
p35235
aVso if you want to know this phenomena 
p35236
aVthe only way you can know 
p35237
aVthe only doorway for you to know life is yourself 
p35238
aVsee  right now can you see me 
p35239
aV yes  i can 
p35240
aV can you
p35241
aVcan you use a finger and point out where i am  
p35242
aVoh  you re wrong 
p35243
aVyou know i m a mystic from south india  
p35244
aVnow this light is falling upon me  reflecting  going through your lenses 
p35245
aVinverted image in the retina  you know the whole story 
p35246
aVwhere do you see me now 
p35247
aV still in the same place 
p35248
ag35199
aV i do 
p35249
aV you see me the way i m projected in the firmament of your mind 
p35250
aVyou cannot see me here  in the very nature of your visual apparatus 
p35251
aVwhere do you hear me right now 
p35252
aVwithin yourself 
p35253
aVwhere have you seen the whole world 
p35254
ag35253
aVnow if there is a grasshopper here 
p35255
aVhe doesn t see me the way you see me 
p35256
aVhe sees me differently 
p35257
aVhe sees the whole world differently 
p35258
aVnow you  you can think   oh  he s no good 
p35259
aVthis is the fundamental problem that we think his perception is no good 
p35260
aVno  no  his perception is very good for his survival 
p35261
aVyour perception is very good for your survival
p35262
aVbut it s not good enough to know the nature of life 
p35263
aV but i
p35264
aV so now   what do i know  means i have enhanced
p35265
aVenhanced my perception the way it is important
p35266
aVto know the nature of life 
p35267
aVnot just for survival 
p35268
aV but if inner engineering as a spiritual technology is something that works 
p35269
aVi ask you again 
p35270
aVwhy do we need gurus  because
p35271
aVthat means the answers are within us 
p35272
aV you re speaking so much language 
p35273
aVdid you learn a  b  c  d
p35274
aV i think so 
p35275
aV do you remember when you re four years of age 
p35276
aVthat damn  a  how complicated it was 
p35277
ag35019
aV two versions to it 
p35278
aVyou had to write it a hundred times to get the damn  a 
p35279
aVtoday you can close your eyes and write 
p35280
aVso it doesn t matter how simple something is 
p35281
aVwithout a certain guidance 
p35282
aVcould you have picked up a  b  c  i m asking 
p35283
aVno 
p35284
aVsimilarly  when something new you have to approach 
p35285
aVif you don t have the right kind of guidance 
p35286
aVyou won t pick it up 
p35287
aV tell us a little bit about yourself 
p35288
aVyour story is well chronicled
p35289
aVbut what is of interest to people is that you started off as
p35290
aV i haven t read that book 
p35291
aVi don t know 
p35292
aVi hope she s written nice things about me  
p35293
aV she s written a very brilliant 
p35294
aVarundhati s  subramaniam has written a very brilliant 
p35295
aVvery brilliant book 
p35296
aV no  she s brilliant
p35297
aVbut what s she written about me  
p35298
aV one of the things that she has said is that
p35299
aVyou give great space for dissent 
p35300
aVyou like a good argument 
p35301
aVthat you re not an  you re not one of those dictatorial gurus  
p35302
aV i don t know where is a dictatorial guru 
p35303
aVi think the  most people have not met a guru 
p35304
aVthey have just seen calendar images and made conclusions 
p35305
aVi don t think they have met any genuine guru 
p35306
aVthere are a whole lot of people who should have been temple priests
p35307
aVwho are good entrepreneurs and they ve become gurus today  
p35308
aVthat s different  okay  
p35309
aV temple priests
p35310
aV no  no  see
p35311
aV   who have become good entrepreneurs 
p35312
aV no  i m saying
p35313
aV just another word of
p35314
aVway of saying they re charlatans 
p35315
aV that s a strong word 
p35316
aVmaybe that s enterprise  
p35317
aVi am not a enterprise 
p35318
aVso because i am not an enterprise 
p35319
aVi want everybody to ask whatever the damn question they have 
p35320
aVit doesn t matter how ridiculous or how intelligent 
p35321
aVhow nonsensical it is  it doesn t matter 
p35322
aVif the question means something to you 
p35323
aVit means something to me 
p35324
aVit doesn t matter how brilliant it is 
p35325
aVif it doesn t mean anything to you 
p35326
aVi am not willing to listen to it 
p35327
aV but you re saying that many 
p35328
aVmany people are  who are positioning themselves as gurus
p35329
aVare really only elevating themselves and fooling people  i ve
p35330
aV  no  i didn t say
p35331
aV okay  i m saying that 
p35332
aV i m saying 
p35333
aV but
p35334
aV  the thing there is there is a vacuum 
p35335
aVsomebody is trying to fill it 
p35336
aV yes  and sadhguru  you have been
p35337
aV are they qualified to be that 
p35338
aVquestionable thing 
p35339
aV but a very genuine concern
p35340
aVand you have been on some of my television programs
p35341
aVwhere we have spoken about this  
p35342
aVis whether god men are often con men 
p35343
aVand how does this lady here  know the difference
p35344
aVbetween who s a god man and who s a conman
p35345
aVand is a human being capable of being a god man 
p35346
aVdo you think of yourself as a god man 
p35347
aV  why are you underestimating that lady  
p35348
aV okay  let it be my question  
p35349
aVhow do i spot the difference between a god man and a con man
p35350
aVif i don t even believe that humans can be godly 
p35351
aVi think humans can be brave and wonderful and inspiring and
p35352
aVbut i don t think that they have magical powers 
p35353
aV see  did you ever see god having magical powers 
p35354
aV no  i ve never seen god 
p35355
aV no  then why are you saying he must have magical powers  
p35356
aVso first of all 
p35357
aVthis god man is essentially a media coined word 
p35358
aVnobody claims that he is a god man  okay 
p35359
aVsome are goddamn men  that s different  
p35360
aVnobody
p35361
aVi don t think anybody has personally claimed 
p35362
aV i am a god man 
p35363
aVi have not met anybody like that 
p35364
aVnow  that is a
p35365
aVthat s another kind of profession 
p35366
aVputting labels on everybody  you know  
p35367
aVleaving that alone  what is it 
p35368
aVthis is a culture   you must understand this 
p35369
aVit s unfortunately all mixed up today
p35370
aVthis is a godless culture  you must understand this 
p35371
aVthere has never been an idea of a god in this culture 
p35372
aVonly in competition with what came from outside 
p35373
aVbecause we saw they could rule us 
p35374
aVthey were dominant and we thought we have to imitate their ways 
p35375
aVwe also started making it up to some extent 
p35376
aVnot successfully though 
p35377
aVyes 
p35378
aVbut we know the technology of god making 
p35379
aVwhen i say technology
p35380
aVwe are using the english word  god 
p35381
aVbut that word doesn t exist in india 
p35382
aVhere we call them devas 
p35383
aVwhat a deva means is
p35384
aVsee today media is projecting tendulkar as a cricketing god 
p35385
aVit s very appropriate to this culture
p35386
aVbecause if somebody excels beyond a certain level in any field
p35387
aVhe may be a sportsperson 
p35388
aVhe may be a warrior 
p35389
aVhe may be an artist 
p35390
aVhe may be anything  
p35391
aVif he excels beyond what normally average human beings think is possible for them 
p35392
aVhe goes 
p35393
aVthey recognized him as a deva
p35394
aVand he s worth looking up to
p35395
aVbecause he becomes a guiding light for them 
p35396
aVthat ll anyway happen  whether you like it  you believe it  you don t believe it 
p35397
aV sure 
p35398
aV in every field  somebody rises  he becomes the light for the rest of the people 
p35399
ag35019
aV so similarly  in the inner spaces
p35400
aVwhen i say the inner spaces 
p35401
aVthe quality of your life is not determined by what kind of house you live in 
p35402
aVwhat clothes you wear 
p35403
aVwhat car you parked outside 
p35404
aVwhat things  jing bang happening around you 
p35405
ag35284
aVthis moment how joyful  peaceful  blissed out you are within yourself 
p35406
aVnow if i sit here 
p35407
aVwe re sitting here in the same space 
p35408
aVbreathing the same air 
p35409
aVprobably we ate the same kind of food
p35410
aVi don t know what you eat 
p35411
aVbut if i sit here now with my eyes closed 
p35412
aVthe way i am within myself 
p35413
aVi will not exchange this  for anything in the universe 
p35414
aVnow  when people see  no matter
p35415
aVthe number of things i m managing is insane 
p35416
aVeverybody thinks 
p35417
aV sadhguru  is it possible  you must go crazy someday 
p35418
aVall volunteers  over three million volunteers 
p35419
aVenterprises  businesses  okay  projects  mega projects on the street 
p35420
aVall kinds of activity going
p35421
aVaround the globe 
p35422
aVif anybody has to go nuts  it s me  okay 
p35423
aVbecause all run by volunteers 
p35424
aVrun by volunteers means
p35425
aVnobody is trained for the job
p35426
aVand you can t fire them for inefficiency because they re volunteers  
p35427
aVall right  
p35428
aVand anytime  they come in anytime and do great things 
p35429
aVanytime they ll walk away  all right 
p35430
aVand nothing should collapse 
p35431
aVtill now  i must tell you this 
p35432
aVas we are sitting here  this day 
p35433
aVprobably little over three hundred and odd programs 
p35434
aVinner engineering programs are happening in the world 
p35435
aVnever in the last thirty three years 
p35436
aVone program has been abandoned or has failed  
p35437
aVthat  that takes enormous management
p35438
aVbut nobody will ever see me getting angry or miserable or tensed out or stressed out 
p35439
aV you ve never lost your temper 
p35440
aV you want me to now   
p35441
aVdo i look like i m incapable of that 
p35442
aVit s not that 
p35443
aVit s not that i m incapable of anger 
p35444
aVit's just that i have never given that privilege to anybody 
p35445
aVi ve not given this privilege to anybody  
p35446
aVthey can make me happy 
p35447
aVthey can make me unhappy 
p35448
aVthey can make me angry 
p35449
aVthey can make me miserable 
p35450
ag35284
aVi kept  these privileges to myself 
p35451
aVso people
p35452
aVyou re talking about miracles or whatever 
p35453
aVpeople ask me 
p35454
aV sadhguru  everybody  in very ashram  miracles are happening 
p35455
aVyou are beating all the miracles down 
p35456
aVif we say something happened 
p35457
aVyou make us look like fools 
p35458
aVno miracle 
p35459
aVi say   what  you want me to pull a pigeon out of my pocket   
p35460
aVif i pull a pigeon
p35461
aV but there are
p35462
aV no  if i 
p35463
aV  gurus
p35464
aV if i
p35465
aV  who claim to do that 
p35466
aVwho have been challenged by rationalists
p35467
aV no  i ll come to this 
p35468
aVif i pull a pigeon out of my pocket 
p35469
aVi have a shitty pocket 
p35470
aVand you have a bird 
p35471
aVwhat are you going to do with this 
p35472
aVyou come to me  i will show you the miracle 
p35473
aVi have thousands of people 
p35474
aVwho are working seven days a week 
p35475
aVsixteen to eighteen days  eighteen hours every day 
p35476
aVin the last two  five ten years 
p35477
aVnot a single moment of irritation  agitation  anger in their life 
p35478
aVthis is a miracle  
p35479
aVthis is a miracle we want to manifest 
p35480
aVyou don t want a miracle 
p35481
aV i agree  this is a miracle 
p35482
ag35019
aV and not that pigeon 
p35483
aVdo you have a pigeon in your pocket   okay  
p35484
aV i told you i don t like a shitty pocket  
p35485
aV i know   now  you were thirteen
p35486
aVin arundhati s book 
p35487
aVi read that you were thirteen when you first quite accidentally discovered yoga 
p35488
aVyou were children playing in
p35489
aVat the bottom of a well  that s what the book says  
p35490
aVtell us  how did you discover yoga 
p35491
aV oh   i told that because that s how it happened to me 
p35492
aVi said that to her 
p35493
aVi don t know how she s written  i ve not read it  
p35494
aVi said that to her because i want people to understand
p35495
aVthe nature of the universe is 
p35496
aVeven if you do  for the wrong reasons 
p35497
aVyou do the right thing  still it works 
p35498
aVif you do the wrong thing even for the right reasons  it still doesn t work 
p35499
aVpeople need to understand this
p35500
aVbecause the whole world has invested on goodness 
p35501
aVthe goddamn goodness is killing the world 
p35502
aVthere re too many good people
p35503
aVand these good people are the biggest problem 
p35504
aVit s always a good indian who wants to fight a good pakistani 
p35505
aVgood hindu wants to fight a good muslim 
p35506
aVgood american wants to fight with just about anybody  
p35507
aVthe more good you are 
p35508
aVthe more fighting you are 
p35509
aVthe more good you think you are 
p35510
aVbecause goodness is always in comparison
p35511
aV don t forget the good journalists
p35512
aVwho promote these fighting everyday on channels  
p35513
aV i  i think  because your goodness comes
p35514
aVby comparing yourself to somebody 
p35515
aVif you were alone on this planet  you wouldn t know
p35516
aVwhether you re good or bad 
p35517
aVwhat we need on this planet is sensible human beings 
p35518
aVlittle more sense we could do with  isn t it  for sure 
p35519
aVin every aspect of life 
p35520
aVengineering essentially means
p35521
aVyou could have built this structure whichever way you want
p35522
aVbut you ll have to keep looking up 
p35523
aVwhen it s going to crash on your head 
p35524
aVengineering means you put it up in a sensible manner 
p35525
aVthe way it stays  without anxiety about it 
p35526
aVsimilarly  inner engineering means you engineer yourself in such a way 
p35527
aVyou can go through the process of life
p35528
aVwithout being anxious about your suffering
p35529
aV what will happen to me 
p35530
aVthere is no such thing because you engineered yourself well 
p35531
aVwhatever the hell happens around you 
p35532
aVwithin yourself you are the same thing 
p35533
aVso every time i launch one mega project 
p35534
aVyou ll say   sadhguru  if it doesn t work 
p35535
aVif it doesn t work  what  
p35536
aVif it doesn t work  what 
p35537
aVif everything that i m doing  if nothing works  i will still die blissfully 
p35538
aVthis is guaranteed 
p35539
aVi want to make sure it s guaranteed for every human being
p35540
aVso that they can live their life without the fear of suffering 
p35541
aVright now  instead of seeing how suffering should go 
p35542
aVpeople are busy romanticizing suffering 
p35543
aVthe moment you romanticize suffering 
p35544
aVit s very clear you are not interested in human well being 
p35545
aVyou like drama 
p35546
aV hmm  you often spoke about
p35547
aVhow economic leaders are going to be the future of the world 
p35548
aVyou ve been interacting with ceos 
p35549
aVit s rare to find a spiritual guru who s also quite openly capitalistic 
p35550
aVare you a capitalist 
p35551
aV what is that 
p35552
aV who believes that wealth creation is for the greater good  of people and society 
p35553
aV see  a whole lot of people are attached to poverty right now
p35554
aVbecause without poor people 
p35555
aVwithout hungry people they cannot survive 
p35556
aVi am not one of those 
p35557
aVi want to see that  six hundred million people on  in this country
p35558
aVare postponing their dinner tonight 
p35559
aVbut we are postponing major decisions in the parliament every day  all right 
p35560
aVi am not a part of that 
p35561
aVi want things to happen because i know what it means to postpone a dinner 
p35562
aVi don t want that to happen to pe  people 
p35563
aVchildren are postponing their dinner tonight 
p35564
aVprobably a hundred million children in this country have postponed their dinner to tomorrow
p35565
aVand that s not a joke 
p35566
aVso  these jokers who identify themselves with this or that
p35567
aVare going on playing their joke on the people 
p35568
aVevery day 
p35569
aVso capitalism is an ancient word  it no more exists 
p35570
aVwe are talking about a market economy 
p35571
aVwhen only a few families had access to capital  it was capitalism 
p35572
aVit is no more capitalism 
p35573
aVany  if you have a good idea
p35574
aVand you know how to execute it 
p35575
aVthere is capital for everyone  all right 
p35576
aVso  we have tried communism 
p35577
aVit s a wonderful idea but that must happen willingly 
p35578
aVif you enforce it  it s the ugliest thing 
p35579
aVwe have seen it
p35580
aVwe have seen a major demo on the planet 
p35581
aVwhen a  most ugly things happened  you tried to enforce it 
p35582
aVkarl marx might have known lot about economy 
p35583
aVyou know  i was  i  when i was fifteen 
p35584
aVi was all gung ho about engels  and karl marx and stuff 
p35585
aVbut he did not understand human nature 
p35586
aVi realized that when i was sixteen 
p35587
aVthirteen  fourteen  i was all fired up reading up all the communist literature from russia 
p35588
aVbut by the time i was sixteen 
p35589
aVi realized these people don t understand what is human aspiration 
p35590
aVwithout understanding what s human aspiration 
p35591
aVyou try to build a society 
p35592
aVyou try to build a nation  it s a disaster  okay 
p35593
aVcruel disaster 
p35594
aVbut maybe it will work when really a country or a society is in total dumps 
p35595
aVyou have to force it out 
p35596
aVwhen you have to force it out 
p35597
aVit works
p35598
aVbut after that it won t work 
p35599
aVin a way  if you come to the ashram
p35600
aVnearly four thousand people are living in the ashram  
p35601
aVwell  you can say it s communist but by willingness 
p35602
aVit s not by   okay  i did so much  so i get so much    no 
p35603
aVeverybody gets what they need 
p35604
aVso this is not enforced  this is by choice 
p35605
aVif by choice you re willing to share  how fantastic it is 
p35606
aVbut  i have nothing  you have something  i want you to share    how ugly it is 
p35607
aV what is it with sadhguru and motorcycles  
p35608
aV these days 
p35609
aVi m on four wheels  
p35610
aV but you haven t given up  your love for bikes or have you 
p35611
aV it s just that when i was
p35612
aVi started  you know  trekking in the jungles when i was ten  eleven 
p35613
aVi would be gone 
p35614
aVif i had ten rupees in my pocket 
p35615
aVi would organize my food and i m gone with this little note in the house 
p35616
aVi can imagine my parents 
p35617
aVi  i always wished i shouldn t have a boy ever  
p35618
aV girls can run away too on bikes 
p35619
aV they run later  
p35620
aVthey don t run at ten  eleven  
p35621
aVand they re on a pillion
p35622
aVthey re usually pillion and if they find a good rider  no problem  
p35623
aVi m saying the thing was 
p35624
aVit s not about the motorcycle or this or that 
p35625
aVit is just that i was a cloud of million questions all the time
p35626
aVand wherever i looked  nobody had a sensible answer 
p35627
aVeverybody has standard answers that they ve heard from somewhere 
p35628
aVnobody has a genuine experiential answer 
p35629
aVso there s a restlessness to explore just about anything 
p35630
aVwhen i was ten  eleven years of age  i would be gone into the forest
p35631
aVfor three  four days 
p35632
aVonce food ran out and i couldn t survive  then i would come back 
p35633
aVso  initially lot of excitement
p35634
aVbut later on they kind of settled down 
p35635
aVthey knew i ll get back 
p35636
aVso when i became fourteen  fifteen 
p35637
aVi cycled across south india 
p35638
aVnot because i was one cycling enthusiast 
p35639
aVnot like today 
p35640
aVwearing a helmet and suited booted for cycling   no 
p35641
aVsimply i cycled because cycling is little faster than walking 
p35642
aVthe moment i became seventeen 
p35643
aVi still didn t have a license but i found a motor to my cycle 
p35644
aVwhich became a motorcycle  
p35645
aVso that because it went little faster 
p35646
aVit s  it supported my restlessness to know something i didn t even know what the hell it is 
p35647
aVi didn t know what i was looking for
p35648
aVbut i had questions about anything i looked at 
p35649
aVeverything in the universe looked like a question mark to me 
p35650
aV but the question about the motorcycle is really to ask
p35651
aVwhether the motorcycle  the land rover or land cruiser  which one is it now 
p35652
aVland rover  land cruiser   i m not sure 
p35653
aVbut whatever  the four wheels  the helicopter  you
p35654
aVi think you once said somewhere that i like
p35655
aVthat whether if it moves on land  water or air  i like it 
p35656
aV this is not
p35657
aVone thing is i like anything that works and machines work  
p35658
aVthe more efficiently  work  the better they are
p35659
aVand why it s important is  after all 
p35660
aVwhat is the quality of an individual human being 
p35661
aVhow smoothly and how efficiently your body  mind and everything functions
p35662
aVis the quality of a human being  isn t it 
p35663
aVso machines always excited me 
p35664
aVwhether it s a s  bicycle or motorcycle or because of you know
p35665
aVlack of the necessary  probably the fitness that i was at that time 
p35666
aVi crisscrossed india on a motorcycle 
p35667
aVtoday it would be hard  so you get into something little more comfortable 
p35668
aV but you know while that makes you a very interesting character to observe 
p35669
aVdid you ever worry that you d be labeled or dubbed a richie rich  person s guru 
p35670
aVthis is you know  this is the sadhguru who
p35671
aV see  the thing is
p35672
aV  flies his own planes
p35673
aV no
p35674
aV  who likes his bmw 
p35675
aVwho like his game of golf 
p35676
aVwho likes having a little frisbee match on the   
p35677
aV  l  let s  let s come to that 
p35678
aVsee  the thing is i would
p35679
aVi wouldn t mind
p35680
aVi even  sometimes we  i  i ride a bullock cart 
p35681
aVnobody reports that though  
p35682
aVi  i  i love to handle the bulls and
p35683
aVi  i still drive that sometimes 
p35684
aVbut now you  i want to have a conversation with you 
p35685
aVthis afternoon till two o clock  i was in jodhpur 
p35686
aVi could have come by bullock cart or a camel cart  
p35687
aVyou had to wait for five days  
p35688
aVi came on time  you must appreciate that  
p35689
aV so it s about efficiency is what you re saying 
p35690
aV yes  so i l  i personally learnt to fly a helicopter
p35691
aVwhere i don t have the time for these things
p35692
aVbut i somehow fit in this and learnt because
p35693
aVseventy percent of our work is in rural india 
p35694
aVtch  i thought this little helicopter could just
p35695
aVi could set the place on fire
p35696
aVbecause i m half the time stuck
p35697
aVhalf my life  i m on the road stuck in some traffic driving myself 
p35698
aVall the time  behind huge
p35699
aVeverywhere  there s no place in the country where there s no traffic jams 
p35700
aVbelieve me  even in rural india  there re traffic jams 
p35701
aVso i thought a helicopter would really revolutionize our work 
p35702
aVi picked up the thing  i got my license 
p35703
aVfaa license but in india it s so difficult to get the license
p35704
aVbecause many of these rules were made before wright brothers  came  
p35705
aV well  according to some 
p35706
aVthe plane was also made before the wright brothers came  
p35707
aVthey say it was made in the vedic ages  they
p35708
aV they're not very wrong 
p35709
aVconceptually  it was made 
p35710
aVwhether physically they built or not 
p35711
aVwe don t have proof for that  conceptually  there s no
p35712
aV conceptually  it s about imagination to think
p35713
aVthat you can move from place a to place b
p35714
aV no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
p35715
aVyou cannot conceptually imagine something entirely 
p35716
aVeven if you imagine 
p35717
aVyou must be able to produce some
p35718
aVyou must understand the principles in some way  as to why something flies 
p35719
aVif you don t understand why something flies  it ll be like that you know once it happened 
p35720
aVa little turtle  very  with great effort 
p35721
aVclimbed a tree  went to the edge of a branch and jumped  fell flat  lot of pain 
p35722
aVslowly  again he crawled up  in another two days  again up  jumped  fell down  again up  fell down 
p35723
aVafter a few days  two birds who were sitting in the opposite tree 
p35724
aVthey were talking and they said 
p35725
aV i think it s time we tell him he s adopted   
p35726
ag35428
aVso i m saying what cannot fly 
p35727
aVyou cannot make it fly 
p35728
aVpeople thought in detail  as to what can fly 
p35729
aVwhat cannot fly 
p35730
aVconceptually they thought 
p35731
aVwhether they built or not  we don t know 
p35732
aVand is it  is it  i mean  it is an established fact 
p35733
aVthey calculated the speed of light 
p35734
aVsomebody  some individual cannot calculate the speed of light just like that
p35735
aVif there was no whole scientific culture around him 
p35736
aVno individual will just drop from heaven and calculate the speed of light  okay 
p35737
aVthere must have been a scientific culture 
p35738
aVotherwise it won t happen 
p35739
aVbut we need to understand there is a difference between science and technology 
p35740
aV but there s also a difference between science and mythology 
p35741
aVsome things are just great stories
p35742
aVthat doesn t mean they actually happened 
p35743
aV see for example 
p35744
aVthere are  there are images or there are sketches which show 
p35745
aVwhich probably somewhere between three to four thousand years ago were made 
p35746
aVwhere it clearly shows a turtle and a round planet sitting on it and going around 
p35747
aVturtle is the best example 
p35748
aVbest analogy for a planetary movement
p35749
aVbecause a turtle cannot accelerate  
p35750
aVsame speed  he just keeps going 
p35751
aVso a round planet on a turtle
p35752
aVis the best way to describe how a planet moves around 
p35753
aVand the very word for geography in this country is bhoogol 
p35754
aVwhich means it s a round planet 
p35755
aVso it is not because of galileo we know it s a round planet 
p35756
aVwe ve always known 
p35757
aVhow do we know 
p35758
aVwe can t know just one scientific fact and not know the other aspects related to it 
p35759
aVso this thing about anything indian  beating it down  is because
p35760
aVone thing is that culture has evolved because half the people 
p35761
aVtheir brains are in greenwich mean time 
p35762
aVthey ve still not gotten out of the 1948  whatever happened 
p35763
aVwe struggled for independence  we came out 
p35764
aVnot just to send them out but to be who we are 
p35765
aVso  that problem is still there
p35766
aVand now there are upstarts who claim all kinds of things 
p35767
aVthere has to be an even balance 
p35768
aVnot beating down this or pumping it up in a  unrealistic way 
p35769
aVbut you cannot deny indian mind has thought about things
p35770
aVthat nobody had thought about in those times 
p35771
aVthere is no question about that 
p35772
aVbut there is a distinction between science and technology 
p35773
aVscience can evolve because of certain intelligence 
p35774
aVtechnology needs material manifestation 
p35775
aVnow we are trying to claim technology  which we should not 
p35776
aVif we just focus on science 
p35777
aVmany things will be attributed to india for sure 
p35778
aV we live in times when faith and spirituality have become very inflammable
p35779
aV don t put them in the same basket 
p35780
aV okay  let s talk about faith first 
p35781
ag35015
aV we live in times when faith for certain has become a very inflammable 
p35782
aVeasily politicized conversation 
p35783
aVif faith should have been personal today  it s not 
p35784
aVtoday you actually have decisions taken in the name of somebody s faith being injured 
p35785
aVso you mentioned food right now 
p35786
aVi read somewhere that you said there s nothing religious about the act of food 
p35787
aVjust eat what you like 
p35788
aV no  no  no  i didn t say that 
p35789
aV eat what s good for you 
p35790
aV i said eat what s good for you 
p35791
aV okay  eat what s good for you 
p35792
aV it s a very different thing  
p35793
aV i correct myself    eat what s good for you 
p35794
aVbut today we have a highly politicized conversation around banning beef in the name of faith 
p35795
aVhow
p35796
aV it s definitely not good for you to eat it 
p35797
aV beef or any meat 
p35798
aV i ll come to that 
p35799
aVfinish it  finish the question 
p35800
aV okay  okay  so i m offering that as one example of
p35801
aVhow i see a politicized conversation taking place around faith 
p35802
aVhow do you reconcile the faith of a large number of people
p35803
aVwith questions of individual liberty 
p35804
aVi know i have read that you like books written by salman rushdie 
p35805
aVwe were the first country to ban him again in the name of faith 
p35806
aVhow do we reconcile faith with individual liberty 
p35807
aV see  it s always been said  faith moves mountains 
p35808
aVyes  but it freezes your mind 
p35809
aVbut the greatest crime you can do on this planet is to move a mountain 
p35810
aVyou should not move a mountain  it should be where it is 
p35811
aVit has not just dropped from somewhere 
p35812
aVit s grown because of various forces functioning in a particular way 
p35813
aVphenomenal activity has happened to build a mountain 
p35814
aVyou should never move a mountain
p35815
aVbut  people with frozen minds always want to move a mountain  okay 
p35816
aVhaving said that 
p35817
aVwhen we say faith 
p35818
aVit s an import for this culture 
p35819
aVwe have never had faith in this culture 
p35820
aVyou must look back little beyond thousand years
p35821
aVsince we ve been under occupation 
p35822
aVhere  we have been told always   your life is your karma 
p35823
aVkarma means action 
p35824
aVwhose action  your action 
p35825
aVso what we are saying is your life is entirely your making 
p35826
aVthere is no someone sitting up there and managing this for you 
p35827
aVthis is entirely yours
p35828
aVbut for every action that you perform
p35829
aVwhether physical  mental  emotional  energy wis
p35830
aVwhatever kind of action you perform  there is bound to be a consequence 
p35831
aVif you re ready for the consequence  do whatever 
p35832
aVif you re going to cry about the consequence  control the action right now 
p35833
aVbased on this  now you came to food 
p35834
aVsee the food consumption has been looked at very carefully in this country 
p35835
aVif you just bring this back  the world will be healthy  do you understand 
p35836
aVhere  we have identified different type of people 
p35837
aVwhat they should eat 
p35838
aVif you re doing menial jobs  how you should eat 
p35839
aVif you re doing trading  how you should eat 
p35840
aVif you re into spiritual process  how you should eat 
p35841
aVif you re into education  how you should eat 
p35842
aVwhy this is is each person needs a different type of building of the body 
p35843
aVyou want to run hundred meters next to mr  bolt 
p35844
aVwhat kind of food you should eat 
p35845
aVyou just want to work in delhi  what kind of food you should eat 
p35846
aVyou want to think in a certain way  what kind of food you d  you should eat 
p35847
aVfor all these  we have very clear prescriptions 
p35848
aVnow when it comes to food 
p35849
aVwhat it means is  we are taking another life  whatever that is
p35850
aVit may be plant life  animal life  whatever
p35851
aVyou re taking another life 
p35852
aVingesting it and you have to make it your life  
p35853
aVthat s the whole thing 
p35854
aVwhat is your life  what is that life  if you look at it 
p35855
aVall life on this planet is coming from the earth 
p35856
aVthis body is also the same soil 
p35857
aVthis is also same soil 
p35858
aVif there is a earthworm  that is also same soil
p35859
aVbut see how it has become  how this has become 
p35860
aVhow that has become 
p35861
aVif i give you  you like a mango or a banana 
p35862
aV mango 
p35863
aV mango  i know   you re ru
p35864
aVyou re ruling the state right now  referring to the aam aadmi party
p35865
aVnow  if you eat a mango  this mango becomes a woman in you 
p35866
aVif i eat a mango  the same mango becomes a man in me 
p35867
aVif a cow eats a mango  the same mango becomes a cow in the cow 
p35868
aVwhy is this happening 
p35869
aVthere is a certain information or software in you
p35870
aVwhatever you eat it transforms it into a woman 
p35871
aVif i eat  it transforms into a man 
p35872
aVif a cow eats  that becomes a cow 
p35873
aVso every life is happening the way it is happening
p35874
aVbecause of a certain dimension of information
p35875
aVor in modern terminology  let s call it software 
p35876
aVthere is a certain software  which is an arrangement of information 
p35877
aVnow  the idea is to eat as simple a software as possible 
p35878
aVif you eat that kind of life  which is a very simple software 
p35879
aVyour ability to override that software and make it entirely a part of you is very good 
p35880
aVas that software gets   complex 
p35881
aVmore and more complex 
p35882
aVyour ability to integrate it goes down 
p35883
aVso  especially if it s a creature which has some sense of thought and emotion 
p35884
aVif it has emotion  then you should not eat it 
p35885
aVthis is the understanding 
p35886
aVan animal  which has any emotion 
p35887
aVdisplays certain emotions
p35888
aVespecially if it displays emotion which is near to human emotion 
p35889
aVyou should not eat it
p35890
aVbecause it will not integrate itself 
p35891
aVthat animal nature will start manifesting itself 
p35892
aVor in other words  in india 
p35893
aVtoday maybe in cities people do not know 
p35894
aVyou see in the villages 
p35895
aVpeople have very intimate relationship with a cow 
p35896
aVthey have drunk the milk of that cow 
p35897
aVtheir children are drinking the milk of that cow 
p35898
aVthere is a very deep relationship 
p35899
aVif you do not know this  cow is one creature 
p35900
aVif something happens to you and you are in some kind of grief or misery 
p35901
aVyou don t have to be near the cow 
p35902
aVwherever the cow is in your house 
p35903
aVit will   it ll start shedding tears for you 
p35904
aVyou know  i ve seen this with my eyes  i couldn t believe  
p35905
aVwhen somebody is dead in the house it  what does a cow know 
p35906
aVit is somewhere  simply tears flowing 
p35907
aVso when it s  has such deep emotions 
p35908
aVif you kill it  it s like killing a human being 
p35909
aVit s murder or it s cannibalism 
p35910
aVso because of that   this is not a faith thing 
p35911
aVthis is not a religious thing 
p35912
aVwe thought this is a fundamental sense 
p35913
aVwhy  when we are hungry  why can t i cut you up and eat you 
p35914
aVwhat s wrong  
p35915
aVwhat s wrong  i m asking 
p35916
aV but what you re saying should be about many more animals than just the cow 
p35917
aV yes  yes of course 
p35918
aV and when it becomes about only the cow 
p35919
aVthen there is a  there is certainly a perception
p35920
aV i  it is not
p35921
aV  that it is a political decision or a religious decision 
p35922
aV no  no  i am not talking about the  whatever the laws that are happ
p35923
aV this is not about people getting up and saying 
p35924
aV it s cruel to be  to be a meat eater 
p35925
aVthat would be a different argument 
p35926
aV hmm  i am not even talking about cruelty 
p35927
aVeven cutting a plant is cruel  in my experience
p35928
aVbut you have to do it 
p35929
aVbut if you are conscious of it  you will do it to the minimum possible extent 
p35930
aVnot do it wantonly  that s the whole thing 
p35931
aVnow  about this political ban about cow slaughter or whatever 
p35932
aVthis has many things 
p35933
aVone thing is there is a sensitivity 
p35934
aVonce you drink milk from the cow  she is like your mother 
p35935
aVkilling your mother and eating her up is something
p35936
aVpeople cannot digest in this country 
p35937
aVstill eighty percent of the people belong to that category
p35938
aVand they re  they re hugely
p35939
aVthere s a huge emotion 
p35940
aVsuch a emotion  which because they ve always been made to be docile in a certain way 
p35941
aVthey have not violently  reacted to it
p35942
aVbut in some places it has happened 
p35943
aVin villages and other places 
p35944
aVthere is already a beef ban in many villages just by norm 
p35945
aVnot by any law  that you don t bring these kind of  things into the village 
p35946
aVi am not saying you must ban it or not ban it 
p35947
aVi am saying the sensitivities of your population  you
p35948
aVwithout considering  you can t go do this blatantly 
p35949
aVbecause it is growing 
p35950
aVit s becoming a growing business 
p35951
aVindia is becoming a major exporter of beef  that s not right 
p35952
aVeven if somebody ate something  it is up to them 
p35953
aVit s their personal taste  whatever
p35954
aVbut now you re promoting it and you re making it grow 
p35955
aVthere is serious concern but our people don t express it 
p35956
aVour people don t go out on the street and not going to kill anybody
p35957
aVbecause they killed a cow 
p35958
aVso ban is not what is needed 
p35959
aVmore education was needed rather than banning 
p35960
aV but you haven t spoken to what happens when faith
p35961
aVfaith repeatedly seems to come into conflict with individual liberty
p35962
aVby the banning of books 
p35963
aVthere were people killed in paris
p35964
aVbecause they were seen to have mocked 
p35965
aVyou know of the prophet mohammed and so on 
p35966
aV see
p35967
aV so where does this end 
p35968
aVwhere do we stop violence and politics in the name of religion 
p35969
aV if you  if you want that to stop  you must understand this 
p35970
aVyou re saying   today  today  it s not today 
p35971
aVin the last 2 000 years  this is the history of the world 
p35972
aVcontinuously it s happening all over the world 
p35973
aV so is that bombers are a new phenomenon 
p35974
aV well  you ve forgotten about the crusades and the other things 
p35975
aVwhich have not been reported in history  
p35976
aVhundreds of millions of people have been killed in the name of god  all right 
p35977
aVit s new to us here  but even here 
p35978
aVthousands  hundreds and thousands have been slaughtered in northern part of india
p35979
aVjust because the faith that they belonged to when the invasions happened 
p35980
aVnobody writes about it because we never took the pen and wrote 
p35981
aVsomebody wrote history for us the way they like it 
p35982
aVbecause all history is sponsored by kings 
p35983
aVthey wrote the history the way they want
p35984
aVand they said they are great emperors
p35985
aVbut what they did was absolutely terrible 
p35986
aVso you need to understand  faith is a new thing to us 
p35987
aVwhen i say new 
p35988
aVin this country which has 12 15 000 years of history behind us 
p35989
aV1 000 years is new for us 
p35990
aVwe ve still not come to terms with it 
p35991
aVwe re still struggling with it 
p35992
aVbut struggling within ourselves 
p35993
aVnot creating a struggle on the street because that s not our nature
p35994
aVbecause here always we ve  been drilled into us 
p35995
aVwhatever you do there ll be a consequence for you 
p35996
aVeven if you come back another life  another life  it won t leave you 
p35997
aVit ll come back to you  tch  this has been told
p35998
aVthis controls people  this is a
p35999
aVthis is a tremendous technology  please understand this 
p36000
aVand it s not simply a fake thing  it is a real thing 
p36001
aVeverything that you think  feel  act  there is a consequence 
p36002
aVnot because there is somebody thinking he must give  gift
p36003
aVgive you a reward or a punishment 
p36004
aVit happens in your own chemistry 
p36005
aV how do we keep faith 
p36006
aVwhich you say is new to us  separate from politics 
p36007
aVyou have  you have  in the past for example 
p36008
aVi remember when anna hazare was lodging his anti corruption movement 
p36009
aVyou did come and applaud it
p36010
aVbut you said that the lokpal was not some magic wand 
p36011
aVi remember you saying that 
p36012
aVdo you believe that we are seeing a dangerous cocktail of faith and politics
p36013
aVgetting more and more mixed up 
p36014
aV see  it is happening 
p36015
aVi m not saying no
p36016
aVbut it s much less than ever before 
p36017
aV really 
p36018
ag35019
aV it seems to be much more than ever before 
p36019
aV no  that s because of you  
p36020
aVthat s because
p36021
aVthat s because if  if ten people get beheaded in some remote part of iraq 
p36022
aVyou make sure the blood spills into my sitting room 
p36023
aVbecause of that 
p36024
aVotherwise  you re sitting here now 
p36025
aVtoday  let s say 1 000 years ago 
p36026
aVwe were sitting here 
p36027
aV1 000 people got killed in iraq 
p36028
aVwe will sit here peacefully thinking world is going really great 
p36029
ag1497
aVspring time  
p36030
aVeverything is nice 
p36031
aVso  this is because the dissemination of information 
p36032
aVif ten people get killed somewhere  it s a huge thing
p36033
aVbecause it comes into our sitting rooms  bedrooms  dining room 
p36034
aVeverywhere there is a television 
p36035
aVso it pours into our homes 
p36036
aVso it is happening 
p36037
aVso  this is good because even a small thing looks magnified now in people s experience
p36038
aVbut this has been happening always 
p36039
aVit s happening at its lowest level now 
p36040
aVhere and there it spurts up  which needs to be controlled for sure 
p36041
aVbut what i see is 
p36042
aVfor the first time 
p36043
aVfor the very first time in the history of humanity 
p36044
aVeven if you
p36045
aVthe numbers are not qualified
p36046
aVbecause the population has increased 
p36047
aVeven in terms of percentages of people 
p36048
aVhow many people can think for themselves today is huge
p36049
aVcompared to what it was a hundred years ago or five hundred years ago
p36050
aVor 1 000 years ago or 10 000 years ago 
p36051
aVall these centuries 
p36052
aVthere would be one man in the village who thinks for you 
p36053
aVwho reads for you 
p36054
aVwho writes for you 
p36055
aVyou just have to do what you have to do  simple things 
p36056
aVtoday  everybody is able to think for himself or herself 
p36057
aVnow  human intellect is blossoming 
p36058
aVi do not say it is blossoming in the right direction 
p36059
aVwith the right sense 
p36060
ag35284
aVinsanely it is blossoming 
p36061
aVit doesn t matter  insanity will happen for some time 
p36062
aVpeople will come to their senses 
p36063
aVwhen something is new they ll go crazy  after some time they ll come to senses 
p36064
aVonce human intellect blossoms sufficiently on the planet 
p36065
aVthen this looking upward for well being will not make sense 
p36066
aVbelieve me 
p36067
aVright now  from looking upward 
p36068
aVslowly the world is tilting for
p36069
aVin pursuit of human well being  people were looking heavenward 
p36070
aVstill many are  that s different 
p36071
aVbut a whole lot of people have started looking outward 
p36072
aVso if you look heavenward  hallucinations will happen 
p36073
aVwars will happen
p36074
aVbecause my heaven and your heaven different  you know 
p36075
aVnone of the heavens have anything for women 
p36076
aVyou better know that  
p36077
aV i am definitely going to hell   anyway
p36078
aV so you believe in heaven and hell  
p36079
aV i was being facetious 
p36080
aVi was being facetious 
p36081
aV let me finish this 
p36082
ag36080
aVi don t know if there is somebody up there 
p36083
aV that s fine  that is fine  i
p36084
aV is it a force  is it energy  is that inside me 
p36085
aV no  i m saying this
p36086
aVthis thing about looking heavenward is slowly going away
p36087
aVand in pursuit of well being  people are looking outward 
p36088
aVthis is ripping the planet apart 
p36089
aVhuman pursuit of well being is just destroying the planet 
p36090
aVnow  the fundamentals of what we are transmitting
p36091
aVthe fundamentals of this culture 
p36092
aVwhich is essentially rooted in the yogic culture 
p36093
aVwhat you call as indian culture or hindu culture is essentially a pure yogic science 
p36094
aVin the form of culture 
p36095
aVit finds many colors and distortions 
p36096
aVwhich is what you re seeing as the hindu culture or indian culture 
p36097
aVwhatever you want to call it 
p36098
aV but they re not interchangeable terms 
p36099
aV why 
p36100
aV because we re  a multi religious country with many different cultures 
p36101
aV  we have  i want you to 
p36102
aVi want you to understand the word hindu does not signify a religion 
p36103
aVyou ask them do they worship one god if they are hindus 
p36104
aVin the same family  they re worshipping twenty five gods  
p36105
aVthey don t
p36106
aVthey don t know which is the god 
p36107
aVso they re making sure worship everything  
p36108
aVjust in case something will hit  okay  
p36109
aVnow  the word hindu means the land between himalayas and indusagara 
p36110
aVthis land  this subcontinent is hindu 
p36111
aVall people who are born here are considered hindu
p36112
aVbecause it s a geographical identity 
p36113
aVi know there s a whole political issue  if i speak like this 
p36114
aVthey say   oh  he s hindu 
p36115
aV no  i mean people will tell you you re echoing the rss  chief  
p36116
aV i don t know what he said  i have not
p36117
aV he said all indians are hindus and there was a huge
p36118
aV okay  i am not
p36119
aV  political outcry over that 
p36120
aV okay  all indians live between himalayas and indian ocean  
p36121
aV that s okay 
p36122
aV those who want to jump into the ocean
p36123
aV that s okay  
p36124
aV if you live   see  this is a dialectical culture 
p36125
aVit expresses things in a certain way 
p36126
aVbetween himalayas and indian ocean if you live  you are a hindu 
p36127
aVif you jump into the ocean and cross  you are a lanka  okay  
p36128
aVso  i don t know what is the struggle about this 
p36129
aVthis is because there is such a narrow understanding of this 
p36130
aVthis is the debate which we have to change in the country
p36131
aVbecause somebody has absolute belief systems 
p36132
aVwe are trying to compare that
p36133
aVto a culture where there is no such thing as belief 
p36134
aVwe have not ever been believers 
p36135
aVwe ve always been seekers 
p36136
aVthis is a land where the highest value has never been god 
p36137
aValways liberation 
p36138
aVmukti
p36139
aVfreedom is the highest goal 
p36140
aVgod has never been the highest goal  
p36141
aVso you  you put this in the same box as something 
p36142
aVwhich just believes this is it or you re dead  
p36143
aVunfortunate 
p36144
aVthat s not the way to look at it 
p36145
aVthis is what we have to bring back  if we really value human freedom 
p36146
aVyou must bring back this seeking for liberation 
p36147
aV i want to be free  not just from others but from myself and my god and my heaven and everything 
p36148
aVbecause god has never been the goal in this culture 
p36149
aVgod is just another tool 
p36150
aVwhen i use the word tool for a god 
p36151
aVpeople get very hurt 
p36152
aVthey say   sadhguru  don t say that  it hurts us 
p36153
aVi say   that s okay  you come to the ashram 
p36154
aVi ll give you some plumbing job   all right  see
p36155
aV that ll hurt more  
p36156
aV no  no  no   no spanner  no winch  nothing 
p36157
aVuse your fingers  nails  teeth  whatever 
p36158
aVthree days later  nails will be gone 
p36159
aVhalf the teeth will be gone 
p36160
aVthen i will give you a spanner 
p36161
aVwill you worship the spanner or no   
p36162
aVwe are who we are
p36163
aVas  as human beings 
p36164
ag36163
aVonly because of our ability to use a tool 
p36165
aVotherwise you are not even good as a dog 
p36166
aVyou can t even fight a dog  isn t it 
p36167
aV so you re against organized religion 
p36168
aVquite clearly 
p36169
aVif god is just a tool and
p36170
aVfaith is not the same as spirituality
p36171
aV  no  i  see  no  no  i m not  i m not saying i m against this or that 
p36172
aVall i m saying is i want human beings to come to this much
p36173
aVif you know something you know it 
p36174
aVif you don t know something you don t know it 
p36175
aVeverything that you do not know you believe  
p36176
aVthis is a dangerous thing 
p36177
aVnow  the fight on the planet is
p36178
aVnot between good and evil  this and that  no  
p36179
aVone man s versus another man s belief 
p36180
aVi m saying why the hell do you believe anything 
p36181
aVbecause you re essentially not straight enough to admit 
p36182
aV i really don t know 
p36183
aV i don t know  people can t fight 
p36184
aVi don t know  you don t know   can we fight 
p36185
aV i know  is a fight 
p36186
aV i do not know  is never a fight 
p36187
aV i do not know  is a way of seeking 
p36188
aVif we do not establish this seeking in every human being 
p36189
aVthat every human being is longing to know
p36190
aVwhether outside or inside  whatever 
p36191
aVyou are
p36192
aVbecause this is the nature of human intelligence 
p36193
aVit can t sit quiet 
p36194
aVit can only sit quiet if you freeze it with belief system 
p36195
aVif you seal it with belief system  it can sit quiet 
p36196
aVotherwise the very nature of this intelligence is it wants to know 
p36197
aV okay  we re almost at the end so i think i m going take a few questions 
p36198
aVjust two three minutes of questions 
p36199
aVi m seeing lots of hands go up 
p36200
aVthe lady behind you 
p36201
aVyes please 
p36202
aV namaskaram  sadhguru  in one of your videos 
p36203
aVyou say that the problem with the world is that
p36204
aVmost people lack the intensity 
p36205
aV   
p36206
aV most people lack the necessary intensity 
p36207
aV mhmm 
p36208
aV and then you say the way is dhyana 
p36209
aVso intensity is more associated to fierceness in personality
p36210
aVand dhyana is more associated to calmness 
p36211
aVso they re somehow counterintuitive 
p36212
aVcan you elaborate a little 
p36213
aV people think peace means rest in peace 
p36214
aVbecause their idea of peace is death 
p36215
aVpeace can be very intense 
p36216
aVpeace can be tremendously intense
p36217
aVbecause peace means the reverberations of life have become subtle and intense 
p36218
aVaction means reverberations of life are not so subtle 
p36219
aVit is at a certain level 
p36220
aVso peace happens not because
p36221
aVpeace may happen if somebody is dead
p36222
aVbut to be alive and peaceful means
p36223
aVyou need to be highly intense state of energy 
p36224
aVotherwise you can t be peaceful 
p36225
aVthe reason why most people who don t have any problems as such 
p36226
aVyou know after all they re trying to earn a living 
p36227
aVreproduce and bring up their children and die one day 
p36228
aVjust for that they re freaking simply because of lack of intensity 
p36229
aVbecause life is happening at a low ebb 
p36230
aVnaturally everything is a problem 
p36231
aVif it rises a little bit  suddenly you have a little clearer view of everything 
p36232
aVfor this  you need a higher intensity of energy within you
p36233
aVand the yogic system is essentially focused towards that 
p36234
aVdhyana does not mean    no  
p36235
aV okay  let s take the next question 
p36236
aVhere  right here in the front row  yeah 
p36237
aV sadhguru  what i get from isha s philosophy 
p36238
aVif i may say there is  is
p36239
aVthat you need to see internally 
p36240
aVin your interiority 
p36241
aVyou need to fix it internally before fixing your external situations 
p36242
aVbut is it also not right
p36243
aVis it also not very important to do the right thing externally  you know 
p36244
aVjust to make myself more clear you know 
p36245
aVif i be more precise
p36246
aV no  no  i m clear  i get the question  
p36247
aVwhy  do i look so dumb  
p36248
aV let s say you know  if somebody
p36249
aV i got it 
p36250
ag35201
ag36250
aV if somebody is born
p36251
aV i got the question  
p36252
aV isha s philosophy is not about looking internally or externally 
p36253
aVit is just that if you re looking for mangoes 
p36254
aVyou look up the tree 
p36255
aVyou don t dig the earth  all right  
p36256
aVbut if you re looking how to plant a mango tree 
p36257
aVthen you dig the earth 
p36258
aVyou re looking for mangoes if you dig the earth  will you find it  i m asking 
p36259
aVso if you  inner things  you must look inward 
p36260
aVouter things you must look outward 
p36261
aVthere is no such philosophy  
p36262
aV look out or look in 
p36263
aVwherever the damn thing is 
p36264
aVlook there  
p36265
aV like you know  shankaran pillai went for a job interview 
p36266
aVand they asked him 
p36267
aV which is further  mumbai or moon 
p36268
aVhe thought profoundly and then said   mumbai 
p36269
aVthey said   how do you say this 
p36270
aVhe said   i can see the moon  i can t see mumbai   
p36271
aV okay  last question  yeah 
p36272
aV namaskaram sadhguru  i just want to ask
p36273
aV hold the mike closer to you 
p36274
aV yeah  i just want to ask you that
p36275
aVeverybody s perception of good and bad is different
p36276
aVand what do you think if we start manifesting our own good and bad 
p36277
aVwhat ll be the state of the society 
p36278
aV hmm  maybe you won t have power tonight  
p36279
aVi think i already made this clear 
p36280
aVthe biggest problem with the world is there re too many good people 
p36281
aVnot enough sensible people 
p36282
aVsense is life specific  okay 
p36283
aVgoodness need not be life oriented 
p36284
aVgoodness may be going to heaven 
p36285
aVand the moment  
p36286
aVi want you to understand this dangerous concept 
p36287
aVpeople don t address this  
p36288
aVthe moment you believe
p36289
aVsuppose i believe there is heaven and it s a beautiful place
p36290
aVand you can live in the company of gods 
p36291
aVshould i send you there today or no 
p36292
aVif i really care for you  i m saying  
p36293
ag35378
aVif i really care for you and if i believe there s a great place 
p36294
aVshould i send you there or not 
p36295
aVthis is a dangerous thing  do you understand 
p36296
aVif you stretch it to its logical end  it s a really dangerous thing 
p36297
aVthe moment i believe there is a fantastic place up there 
p36298
aVi really love you and i want you to go there  you know  
p36299
aVtch  yes  
p36300
aV okay  let me just end by asking you something that we haven t spoken
p36301
aVabout and then i ll hand it over to chiki 
p36302
aVyou said you love machines 
p36303
aV i didn t say i love them  
p36304
aV okay  you like machines 
p36305

p36312
aVthese are fantastic things in our life 
p36313
aVthings  see  in every way 
p36314
aVcompared to how a human being was  let s say hundred years ago 
p36315
aVyou re almost superhuman 
p36316
aVtch  hundred years ago  if i could just pick up something from my pocket
p36317
aVand talk to somebody in america right now 
p36318
aVi would be superhuman 
p36319
aVwhy superhuman 
p36320

aVhundred years ago 
p36322
aVfive hundred years ago  if i just had a light bulb 
p36323
aVi would have become god on this planet 
p36324
aVi want you to know  look at the things we have today 
p36325
aVwe are really superhuman 
p36326
aVonce this kind of capability has come to us 
p36327
aVlittle more sense has to rise

aVlittle more awareness and consciousness stu
p36329
aVhas to arise 
p36330
aVif this doesn t happen 
p36331
aVthis capability will turn against us 
p36332
aVthis is what you re saying 
p36333
aVnow gadgets are freaking people  why 
p36334
aVit s a simple thing 
p36335
aVyou  if you want to use it  you can use it or you can keep it aside 
p36336
aVbecause you are in a compulsive state 
p36337
aVif you start using a cell phone  you can t stop it 
p36338
aVeven in your sleep you re texting

aVsee the boy is

aVnow  this is the same thing 
p36342
aVif food is good  if you start eating you don t know when to stop 
p36343
aVif you start drinking  you don t know when to stop 
p36344
aVif you start doing something  you don t know when to stop 
p36345
aVthe same thing  it is not about the gadget 
p36346
aVit is not about the food 
p36347
aVit is just that there is not enough consciousness 
p36348
aVthere is compulsiveness 
p36349
aVeverything is happening compulsively 
p36350
aVinstead of addressing the root  you re trying to kill the gadget 
p36351
aVgadget is a fantastic thing 
p36352
aVevery damn gadget has enhanced our life in a huge way  isn t it 
p36353
aVdon t curse the gadgets 
p36354

aS'a from the time go on a living'
p37577
aS'i redusandbrigopthetierandthawonday'
p37578
aS'but that the freaking simply because of lack of intensity'

aS'because life is happening at a low ebb '
p37580
aS'natrlyevrything s a problem'
p37581
aS'if you rises a little bit suddenly you have a little clearer view of everything'
p37582
aS'this you need a higher intensity of anyywithhennew'
p37583
aS'and the ogeitsistim is essentially for wistowards that'
