avosationoftiscommingobecause the theme foundation has taken up now like to say that but thousands of us but a longest period compared to anything on this planet is done this dimension of knowing has lived on without any kind of true organization  a can kind of leadership or any other kind of organized support out of sheer efficacy of what it is it's just lived on and to as come in the world  where even truth has to be protected when we talk about east we are not talking about a particular jogreere this must be clearly understood we are not talking about east and west as geographical features in the world then a number of a great minds in amercrim have said things great reverence and admiration the so called is and wisdom of another  minds america produced or to say every morning i bathe my intellect in this stupendous and catmargonel knowledge from the east compassion all our modern world and literature is journey and travel i think my when wentdoutdo probably gave out the best compliment to the east when he woudetothendyof a little over three months he said anything that can ever be done  by man or god has been done in this lamp in a number of others  a  i then amison  any number of people have said many many things  why simpotimportant why is it important to preserve and nurture this dimongdion of life the fundamental reason it seems to be so significantly different ease because it is not aptrodic of human intellect it is not deductions that we made out of our intellect this dimension comes from a profound inner exprince we there is no right and wrong they did not a damn just seeing things the way they are and when misitpaimer we are not talking about the volition  modern translators went about intebudingpelma as hindothamoudwhateer  he religion because they came from a mindset  everybody has to be not belong to some segment of humanity they come from a mindset where humanity has to be divided one where the other because they come from the surface intelligence of human nature which we call as intellect unfortunately the modern societies mordenetdocusionsystems how entirely dedicated themselves to the human intellect completely ignoring other dimensions of intelligence which definitely exist within us wgobetherantelact a native of the intellect is always to dissect and divide because intellect is essentially discriminatory in nature an intellect functions always with a cuddenidenti if you have no identity you cannot use your intellect so with indoidualidentothese either of race religion natshonaloa gaslegendar when you apply your intellect  to split the world into many pieces to the significance of what we are left in to as the spirit the west and wisdom ease it does not come from human intellect  come some a deeper dimongel of intelligence within us when i say a deepodimigton of intelligence  simplistic way of looking at it would be whatever you had for lunch today if you had a piece of bread  over the afternoon  sbetreadis being tranceformed into him in being you definitely cannot do that with your intellect this an intelligence here wichscaeblble off making a benununduthiminbeng you definitely cannot do that with your intellect a dimension of intelligence which is beyond our process thought or the product of intellect is essentially always functioning from a limited amount of data that we have gathered now what we call as is an was  is not coming from a limited amount of data that we have gathered either from the books or our life experience but simply by enhancing our ability to perceive life in ways that the five sense organs cannot function why i m talking about the five cents organsiast all the deer that you have ever gathered which rests in so many aspects within you which is the food for the intellect comes from the five cent so in the very nature of things sense organs cannot perceive the entirety of anything to see this out of my hand you cannot see this part of my hand i is the nature of sense perception even if you take a grain of sand if you see one part of it you cannot see the other face of it sense organs can only perceive incombation you it is no comepetiion your senses are useless  cause that is darkness you know what is like otherwise you just would not know what is like if light with on all the time and there was no dark you would not know what is like be  the silence you know what is sin if there was no silence  not have the idea of what is sin so always in combat it is like let's say you re six feet tall now you walk like a tall man you think like a tall man you feel like a tall man you are all man  you went to another society where everybody theedtreatol a dhanleyouwalkedlike a short ma think like a short  and feel like a short man and you are a short man so what you perceive incompatision is a distortion of reality it is not reality as it is so whatever we perceive in comparison is useful for our saviveltprocess but if we want to not know the nature of this existence sinesonansade not sufficient instrumence what is light for you is darkness for many other creatures  got into an argument with an owl  if you did which is light which is darkness he would it go it would be endless argument who is it you a to   a if you re saying bold either you belong to the diplomatic corps or you have a successful marriage learn to say both both both for ever  you right well that is the basis of all the problems on the planet i am right on your own  the fact of the matter is you are perceiving it as it is necessary for your sirlvivoa  is perceiving it as it is necessary for his sairraval you survivllis all your seeking  your five in organs and intellect are sufficient instruments but if you want to know the nature of existence  she wanted now the fundamental loss of ten which gaan's life the weight happens within us and around us then you need an in a perception or another dimension of intelligence with a new  this you will only cut the world into pieces in the name of religions we have cut the world into humanity to many pieces because intellectually we have a live a our on clusions of deductions  cindwerlyblieesboundtodewid because intellect hersentaly and life with cots it can only this sect by dissection you can know certain things but if you really want to know someone that you low you don't dissect them you embrace them by dissection you may know the kidney liver heart stuff but you will not know that being in any sense  lose it completely dissection is the way of the intellect because it is a sharp instrument he has to go it cradovwhen everything that s given to it  the east found another way out of profoundness of experience you can know life  turning inward you can not life when i said turning inward you must understand that essentially  five scinsorwanti ays outward you can see what a and you but cannot rule you all in widen can yourself you can hear this but so much activity in this war you cannot hear this if an ant crawls upon this hand you can feel it so much blood flowing you cannot feel i was in the very nature of things since ourvinstadoutwardbat the moment you did i give yourself to intellect you all to get enslaved to the limitations of your five senses it is in this context the wisdom of the east is of tremendous significance to the world because it has transcended this slavery to sense perception and learn to perceive life in a completely different way what is this completely different way in english line which if it s a mind it is just one word i suppose to say everything in the ovgiculturethe  sixteen parts to the mind sixteen diamondsions of human map now if i go into sixteen it would take too much time so let me compress it into four the four aspects of the mind of called the ahankara munasand   budeminsthe intellect today modern world is largely run by the intellect so with this we can do many things on the outside we can go on enhancing the comforts and conveniences of life we ve done very well in terms of comforts and coniniens  never before never before another deneration of humanity ever  the kind of comforts and conininses that we have today but at the same time we are whining like now before because as the comforts and convenience increase on the outside  that is less to complain about what is happening around you the emptiness of within the cause within now in a harriblway when you fighting with survival when every day you are struggling to fix small things on the outside you will not realize this when outside is well settled when you will see how hollow life has become the biggest qushtion in the world you will see in the next to a day care to  thehelleydoinghere anyway because everything that needs to be fixed in our time is done now what sevenbonttobillinpeople on the planet but right now gradually it s loving large  less is one of the biggest problems dogs are being tortured to fulfill human loneliness because as you dedicate yourself more and more to your intellect you will netirly become more and more lonely because it keeps on dissecting and cutting life into waious pieces for examination and then you will see you yourself will gisplicup into many parts after some time if you go by the into at hundred percent the next dimonsiond off the mind is a efertohisahankara normally people think it means  not means

prejudice well you may say i am not futtudiceivrveadybroademindid  its a broad prejudice because people are willing to live and die for what the identified with because the nature of the indelictive if you take away the identity i dont know what to do  needs a strong identity  drongstensowholim if you ask them  you indelictuwilnot function you must know all you are a strong sense of belief that this is what i am that is when your intellect and function in a certain way this is like intellect like a sharp knife pankaa on the identities the hand that holds it all the suffering on the planet when is the last time that somebody stabbed you even though you re living in ealeamas but in the last time i have no i ve  maybe when you were in school somebody poked you with a pin at a most a day even that did not  a ignordio or what i m saying is how much suffering for a human being is actually coming from outside almost nothing  is all self help because this is a sharp knife given to you unsteady hand everdedatscatting itself you know we were we were taking him a maypilintibeweaten and i was in a tent someone was cutting an apple and someone else another person says this is a very sharp knife be careful i  me because i stand obvious thing you a knife only because it s sharp he s a them thing is not sharp wawerliqualitaknife and if it's a child   for one man you don't delimits a

havlingsomesuperinsuman life shoulnohaehamlaknife no not a voids of very sharp knife  right i get back to my work to a minutes later he cuts his hand a  the problem is just this you ve been given a sharp knife  to by hand every day cutting yourself you may call it t as you  call it anxiety  all i fear youmecollitmiseryyoucall what do you want  that s happening is your intellect is working against you at all it is unless somebody stabbing you from outside that a different issue to deal with that differently rest is all your own intelligence turning against you you may colegetousendid  no no my mother in law my boss menameou my neighbor the they are not stabbing you the  saying what they want to say it is you who poking yourself because an unsteady hand that's all but this intellect cannot function without a memory bank  what is called as manas is a silo of memory be a at dimensions of memory let's not or the detail but you know this much it is a conscious memory putethereccodmizingussufconsciousmemoty you know that is geniticmemerdy you may not remember how your great yagretblandforthe look like what  nowsessitting on your face  melionirstigohavyourfourfathers were  today your body remembers  you may remember here  ouaboutydremembers every aspect of it in the color of the skin it is remembering not forgotten so that is geneticmamerty that i have a lusionalymamoringy like this is a profound diamondsion of memory in the bar here the tilintimes more memory in your body than in your mind so this is why this is walasmonamyacausia this is an entire manas not in one lets intelectmabeuperebutth manas spreads right to the i mealisellinthe body has a memory of its own  intelligence of it all now the fourth dimmonsin of intelligence is callchitar  is a dimension of intelligence which is unsoliebymamirty if you touch this dinanshin then the memory has no enflence on you you adeneticmemity you aliveiusionalymemerdy your conscious menmariese and conscious memories of conscious memory  a kind of memories you have it has no influence on you or in other words past cannot recycle itself to you see right now you take on this form because of a sudden its a sidtinsofrit if you eat let's say you re a man and you eat a piece of bread this piece of bread planted you man  a woman and you eat a piece of bread the same be of gretturndtiddoawoman you give it your dog it turns into a dog very intelligent bread it is just the memory that you carry here it is a memory which transforms everything the way is so this dimension of intelligence which is called chitta which is untacheby any kind of memory  your intelligence is of significance because it's beyond it is beyond your species it is beyond your form it's beyond your gene beyond your culture  every kind of influence which is essentially memory within new may be unconscious  it is memory playing out in so many ways as long as memories playing up what it means sees  in  we say you are in a state of some sort some sit of a man is a lot of people do they understand as family  sonteratdosn'tmenfamili  a means a cyclical life you are in cycles of life if you re in cycles or if you re going and so so what does it mean  means you re not getting anywhere that s what it means  cycilli'sknife if you good exercise this like running on a dridmen you feel seeking exercise it's good if you want to go somewhere it's no good if you put your cedmallourtertand keep running on it moningvicom's evening two becomes when when they become some i ever i will happen  than in  change every  will happen  in it you dont anyway  at some saameans as long as you re functioning within the first three dimensions of intelligence  you re in a cyclical mode it is all right to exercise yourself but it's not good to go somewhere so  if you want to transcend esonsada nature of who  or the cychlicematureofyour existence then you touch the dimension of intelligence which is effort as tipte why the so all the east and wisdom is of great significance why the pee the east is so significant and important ease because this comes from chitta this does not come from but this does not come from manas  does not come from a huncea thiscomsromtipta and only that which does not come from your individual identity or individual memory that can be truly universal so for this we said this is a note  this does not mean hindu religion thats a very long conception a natandervmianstheultimate law of nature when we say nature there is physical nature and there is an inoniture the it to damangs for this accordingly we made two dimensions of loss physical nature is a changing thing it's always in a process of change and a flux but the inner nature is a constant process me to dimensions of expression for this tide  we frothesencsmutis one is always to be updated for every generation otherwise to delaationswilhkeeponbecueingindfleshing you had a big it another is eternal it s always there it s nobodys business atthanget because it cannot be changed because the fundamentals of life has not changed based on this an entire wisdom arose as to how to exist within you and how to operate around  this happen in nineteen twenty four there was a bishop in the at the dogs gleakahrelition where you  athedoxbeaksegment of a christians they have a pope of their own in is tumbll they believe they are the only true christians others at all the rat according to them so he served this particular segment which is really aftedocandredit being in a stumble being silcroup all kinds of stories of indian mysticism kept wafting uprosttabusos  so he has a longing to go to india  see a lie yogi or a mystic but being a man of  he could not choose where to go and wed not to go after he passed sixty years of age when he semi retired he got an opportunity and went to india and came to southern india so his desire is to meet a real yogi not a book i  testudioyuwlve  to somebody directed him and  go up this hill there in this kind of place there will be one you so he went up well he s not made for the mountain he went huffing and puffing up and then he found in front of a small cave a or i was sitting is clowstardlielessdtop he went there and  he has been told that if youll see a your indian  you must prostrate  he will not made for that but he somehow man made his huvfconpuftentshad down  it comcomotion i opened his eyes and smiled immediately the bishop looked at him and said can i ask you a question the yogi said malments the bishop asked what is life it is after sixty yoshoudavlask this question and you an eight  is when youre sixteen sick  but the water to be a ten  he asked no i laughed and went in to laptus oh life  is like the fragrance of jestmen upon gentle spring breeze the bishop looked at him into a  life is like fragrance of daspengupongemtlepringbriece our teacher told us life is like a torn once it gets into you if  if you sit it hurts  and it hurts  light on his words what is this fragrance of jasmine upon gentle spring resspringliefe so that you ll be smiletand said  at his life so this comes on the wendementa that when a human being clearly expedentially understand that entire experience of human life is created from within nor from our time right now as you sit here buourdlyseeme  not listening to me  can you use your hand and show where i am  no no you re getting it all on  a mystic from south in  now this light is falling upon me reflecting going through your lenses and we todthemighimtevictienareyouanknothehoestoy  similigtnow within yourself where do you me like now than yourself you see that that word within yourself have you ever experienced anything outside of yourself right now someone next to you you the puchyou you think you are experiencing there had no  only experiencing the sensations in your hand in the very nature of things  cannot expediens anything outside of yourself when everything when the had experience of life is caused from within you at least it must happen the way you want it isnt  the world will not happen the way you want it at least the experience of living here within you must happen the way you want it  if if if your experience of life happened just the way you want it how would you keep your  olistfullamisrble  is you must tell me in god bless you  listwellarmisebl  yourself definitely highest level of pleasantness for yourself  want for your neighbor may be divedable  you know what you want for yourself isn't it  now blissfulness or pleasantness of life is not a gold by itself it is only when you re blissful by your own nature that means you determine the nature of your experience no matter what is the situation you will determine the nature of your experience  in other words you have no fear of suffering only and only when there is no fear of suffering will you walk full stride in this life otherwise it's always but what will happen  what will happen to me every step is a half a step now this so called spirit of east and wisdom comes from those being who walked full stride who would determine the nature of their experience the outside never decided who they are so they could walk full stride and explore the depths and dimensions of life that others and there were dead to touch because most of the hamanitesonlconcentabo what will happen to me what will happen to me means what  i suffer that to us  the fesenformostthing if you truly want to explore dimensions which we re raffelingto as an other damage in of wisdom annoying is that first you must determine the nature of your experience you have no fear of suffering only then truly exploring human consciousness becomes a reality touching dimengens of intelligence give success to the ntireuoneuwers becomes a possibility supposed to open up for questions  as a quest  population i work with that are in the verge of homdeses or the added if i tell in that it is your intellect and it's your perception and this doesnt exist they will laugh at me  is difinitegegmotiss he was in the domesttingtosayrik  i wanted to know this vritulity that you teach  pitrlity that many girls teach how is it usable for someone that doesn t have food to eat  it's going to become homeless and there is so many problems peciallyinamelica i mean how do of course i teach them resiliency it's a different fact every time i want to open my mouth and you some of your teachings i have to set that now the first year problem is that you believe in the teachings because this is the problem at the third world then cultured in some belief or the other  it is significant about what is a teffortwasinatenadelmar out of what is lefferto as the indian we re looking at things ease this is not a land of vile systems this is a land of secret never ever were anybody encouraged to believe anything if you see anything that comes from the and you all see  all about questions never about a belief system if you enterlanedinahome in the same house five different people are worshiping twenty five different gods and goddesses this will not made up till minds ritus and they re no problem theyll never fight about it because it's a land of seeking so fast mistake you make is you believe what i say i am constantly reminding you don't believe a goddamting that anybody safe dont be foolish enough to disbelieve it either  you have to do is experiment does it work a doesnt work if it works to keeping otherwesatobisthodwards the problem  about somebody  hungrysomebodyvewnghomelad to body being in a war zone or kinds of horrible things are happening on the planet i am not  no and fiteney said living in a temple i am not living in a temple i am more of the world than you are every  i wondered to understand  running a walantior organization with or four thousand full time wolemnteers and our three million pattamwolanppers doing rilidyaofwort huge brodats or what a dozen businesses  the spiritue moment okay now i want you to understand more things are going wrong with my life on a daily basis than anybody s life now when a man is hungry if you try to tell him your intellect is the source of your problem it had seen it s of see nothing short of that i never spoke to hungry people  said you are indelected the source of the problem im talking to people for bonding in so many ways  i then had a in the bardyteiwoding i am only talking to that segment of the population or not follow fredwell i am doing social projects  the withnotichman education  free  ever go and talk to to man in an indian religion tell him you ll in elected the basis of all your problems what makes you think that im not stupid addoailoflikenat so you also don t do that is for you  to understand this there are million problems on the planet all these million problems are theyssenilly because those who are reasonably well have never cared to reach out and do what to be done in the world in many ways is making sure those people don't get it yes in the  to and to out  produced enough food for eighteen point two billion people we had only six point six billion people and that  but still fifty percent of the population is made  hardly eaten anything this is not because it is no food because is because you and me have not cared isn't it so  it true  true nobody stabbed you in the last twenty five years yes but is it also true you re suffering media things of tension dress anxiety this that is it a peortectof your mind or somebody else poking you from outside it is your reaction to the existential situation a type is to be in what is needed what you see  you see something wrong happening  you see some suffering  something comes your way you  it to poke yourself this  a incaaciteding yourself is of seeing when there is a problem you need empowerment  incapacitating yourself isn't it i m talking about empowering you so that your daminteligins functions for you not against you the moment your intelligence is working against you no word in the unersyesgoingtodhelpyou  can help you yes if your intelligence has turned against you  finished  so i am saying first let your intelligence work for  if it works for you the manimiracless things that you can do  all these people of still not eaten properly one basic things have not been taken care of that our business because somehow we ve landed in a place  you and me are at least you do well once we in such a plivlates we must use our intelligence to see what is the best thing we can do in the world not sit here and ristuselfout i am saying dont twist yourself out if you are joyful naturally you will do the best things you can do if i meet you when you were happy will you be nice to me  no one  on a lie  to very happy if i meet you i m sure you re a wonderful person but when you re depressed when you re unhappy when you first leded  i meet you you could be a nasty person  this is trowiteverihemanbeingisn'te so the first and foremost work that any human being asked to to do is that you make this into our pleasant piece of life so that you naturally exude this pleasant and evpresantnessinevertypossible if this is feeling unpleasant and you tell this one to be pleasant is it at a work we are trying to fix the stomach full people right now s a pleasure listening to you unbelievable  my question is  he can i do to so that i can acquire your skill of tea  one like  here letlysweekingof  you ve bodedyeowarlike you are you  so your heart this before  a ewaartmakseeu  what makes you so secure from within and be so candid  so   the other expression  and now that s a poperlar question  when mersixclavitytha is  i want to tell you a joke by it it's a dirty joke i a a i   a  not as i ll come ward something milder  the problem with the human being right now is this we have created a world we have great educationsistclaatid education systems when we believe that human beings and essentially all wrong or the creation is all wrong or the social creation of the creative is all wrong and you go on a fixit this is a convoluted idea in so paying attention to life we are coming up with vhilosofhieceantphilisaphiesand philicaphy filosahes ad fantastic explanations to that which cannot be explained if you wonder now life you must pay attention to life is in  right now do you egry with me madam  that this human machanison he is the most sophisticated machine on the planet i  are you do  yes   so this is such a complex see this is the super super computer or rick i am asking have you bordered to read the uses man  if you understand how this functions you will know how to use it  we should take a simple gadget like a form the more you know about it the better you can  it is in it  you have definitely coming from and  a libeenbombarded with this thing about realization self realization  lets put it in very simple toms  what self realization means is stofolwhatthe word realization means a realization is not an achievement it is not an accomplishment  is just realization that means something that s always here you just managed to see it now  mensouasstipidallyour life just now you saw it you did not in and something new  you did not ramp yourself up to a mountain no just saw the most obvious thing which was always here you realize so realization means you realized how foolish you have been everything has been right here you can get it  so there many was  of course i mositobeingfromnemginoridan  i have i m i m not live this i have to at matameneverdidtheguiter  because it noweargordto me i m sorry  to the shock  but a ten no  living in india and pieces of this are always looking around there and its you know many pieces of  but i never really studied it in any sense so in in a certain moment when a done as what is the nature of this true that you re talking about where is it so crisnaw laughed and said the highest truth about your life is at the tip of your nose now there are many schools of yoga intensely focusing on the tips of the   last slide for two minutes you will get a heavy you will lonatinlike what is saying is it is the most obvious thing it  the most obvious thing but right now the problem is all the instruments of perception that you have cuhtoutthewaodbab but the seat of your experience is within you the fundamental seat of your experience within you but all the instruments of perception of outward by  how should i do this you must understand anything beyond sir rival if it has to enter yowr life some striving is needed let's say  as a little infant you have left in the jungle without human contact  something edible came in front of you would you first try your ears then norfellda somehow by accident find your mouth  the to you would just know where to put it isn't it to what i am saying is everything that is necessary for saelivbal he s but in to you  on it  five cents a stick care of it but if you want to know something more  to strive for example you remember when you of three four or five years of  you had to learn to write the alphabet that damn a how complicated it was and they on top of it to torsion  you had to write it a hundred times to get it isn't it but today with you  so an right if that striving was not dead to  would you write so they would you know language so anything beyond saidvivel need striving without the needed striving it won happen there are ways to perceive the interiority of who you are but unfortunately has been no striving  right now we made this technology into such a simple  most like a physical sites let it was this  two parts of hadardan one bartorocesen are we come if a great signdthispotsitogether only what a  anadyaputsidogether only at a we come so we made the entire yoga suteruslike this  i you do this this and this this will happen to you  simple and all i m asking deaderlyfrompepeles about therddeete thirty to thirty two hours a focused time to devilopeninsumentaware they can turn in word or to the hours is too much i m saying if you cannot dedicate a live it of time to know what disease that means your existence must be truly wordless if this is worthwhile you must be attention to this isn't it if you not life this is life send  when i say the word life maybe you re thinking about your profession your family your car on no  are all exercise  is life isn't it so    but no attention has been paid you are a of fixing life is fixing all kinds of things s happened one  col'mtpelyewas going on  no no that  sancorambeleas going home  seven thirteen the evening the rules of  libetosoe eight he must be home it's only seven  he thought there still time let me have a quick drink and go he just stepped into the local bar he had a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick  then he looked at the time i said to a   you know drinking people that like  is they become timeless  this is the correlation  then it's late and he got off the bar stool and tried to walk it's such an unfair world a man is supples to walk on a round planet as if that s not enough its fine you notice that the planet is round and it's spinning only when you re had a few drops more or if you ropsavemissingwewindlyouyourtoyears either you are dranteleyouhavitwordtegl younortisetheplanitisofboundandspinning otherwise you think it's flat are you going on fine so it great difficulty was walkingsideraisehim and to find his way home he was crossing a garden and he flipped over and fell face down in erosebush his face became a mess then he somehow reached home  i know this keyholes are so minute  to twentiminats to find the keyhole then he found his way up to the bedroom and then he went into the bad  and he looked at his face to a real mess then he opened the medicine cabinet took up made plaster bandade fixed himself up and slowly crawled into the bed fortunately the wife is a big sleeper  his lap monigato'lockh the life took a bucketful of cold water and placed on him what ordered he woke up so why i on my sunday she said  fool again drinking is  said honey six months ago i promised you since then i haven t touched a drop she grabbed him by the shirt and took him into the bathroom and showed him all the plaster was on the middle why why people have lost their clarity people have lost the claities only because of this that if there is any suffering here they think thisonshouldbefixed if something else happens that one to be fixed if something else happens that one should be fixed everedtheminingpraenminswhat lanafixtebord yes youtlingtofixof the god isn't it so ban and the out  everything that happens with the new still fixing this one  trying to fix everything around you no wonder you ll become tuev the planet sufficiently  in this part of the world if you fix it any more there be no planet left but are people bursting with ecstasy no so because clarity has been lost simply because of this if you understand if life has to really become beautiful for you this one has to be fixed if you understand this one thing claityredonwithinyour  actualehaveapatfionomjista how can you tap into yitawhiches what you said  memory with no effect and the ability to break through cycles right here you want to do that  oukan you can take one fundamental step today that is i want you to  or you already teannotherqurstion  you have the habit of writing things to you just sit down today before you go to bed the right so what are all the different types of identities  you have taken starting from your body everything else just like to do and see and cleared a little distance from the identifications  just a can that that s a first de  that you are not identified with anything you just here draw  as a piece of life not as this or that see  what can i do i am with young woman it now  i see among people if you re just walking by yourself in the garden you don't really think you an on  or if you are that in  why you conhelit even there if it just goes off a little bit you don t sleep as a young woman you just i simply as life isn't it and saying something so funlemendlesourbody and gender even that identities only in the surface your gas glad religion  this is even more on the surface so i am saying

function in the world  before we go to sleep take off all the eyedendedispep on a bethidetabilmoning  they did not go anywhere it there and go to sleep you started the tune like to hear godrugesthurning point and lie where he separated himself from his intellect and as in herself  like some one would lost baingolect  i i think that i was coming out so down  this is is asking for a story gernassjory so  one must understand it's a process that you set forth this that ed happening to me when i was just and on four four and a half years of age i suddenly realized to one day but i dont know anything i don't know anything means  i don't know anything at all  to such an extent if somebody gives me a glass of water i would not know what is what i know if i drink this water it ll quench  the and different ways of  i know what could do with it but i dont know what it is well actually if you look at it even today you don't know what it is is only substance present in the planet in all three different states the refourcstheblannet is water nherelypeprtstokyourbody'swate if you re looking for life you look for a drop of water  lot of excitement they found a few drops on the mars i think people from californanytomagarate  so i m just tearing on this glass of water for hours so in if i found a lily and just looking at the leaf but five six hours of the street if i sit up in my bed staring at the dark  then taeonigttam sitting like this daing my dear father being a physician started thinking i need psycetlic evaluation this boy is simply staring at something  the unblingingesteringis lost it its  problymise i look at this one i still do not know this one there is no way i m able to shift my entered another one i  held my attention i couldn t shift  in this condition they sent me to school and my mother said be  so the bagters i went and batertantinheeties the kind of attention that there never recibintherlo and initially i understood the words that they were speaking and what they were trying to say  to some time i realized the is making sounds i m making up the meanings in my head even now as i speak i m only making sounds you re making up the meanings isn't it because language is a conspiracy between two people  if you have a concbenisy what do you do indians you speak in your language  and indearyhavethisadgan we have the teenahnded languages in the country we can have lots of conspirtoce'sgoingn everwitbeginouron language a soldamnonlymakingsamds isn't that you re making up the meanings so  i realized i m the one was making up all the menus i stopped making the meanings i just heard the sounds with full attention that is the problem it must be  the moment they not understand they think they need not pay attention  i do not understand needs more attention than what you understand isn't it so as i watched titoleftetetur coming in and making noises and nices and nice and going it became very amusing to me and a huge smile spread on my face they were not at all amused a my scaling went like this you very consistent i was i i remember this so well i don't know if you still have this  still have those monthly tests and report cards that your fedanthav on it  while have to get to do stuff like that  so monthly report cards come i see in the school a  chilernarwassprutingatrorm ecause they re foshtofssecond some are sitting and crying because they re afraid to go home with their marks card never once in my ndgieswhoollifediteever open and see  the teachers gave me the card i took it and gave it to my father i thought the sidtensection be me the two of the  i m not the to do with this because i was very consistent always boutsixzeedols  or they always gave an empty paper if they insisted i put my name on it otherwise i gave an im as a  when the final lictumcame it out something underenderthenexplas otherwise all my tests i got to a a i a  because  million things in  i have a billion questions in my mind about everything there is nobody allournhosecapable of antering thisqurstion but the piano tough something else into you i am not evisteden  so school went like this  about eight years ago this school  i studied nearly forty forty five years ago they came to invite me for their one hundred and twenty fifth anniversity of the school so the test the third delevation of dresties came to invite me they said you must come i said see i was not just a not good student i was not even a student why me  you ll call a brilliant students of your school  me this had unowwerssolisproduceyunirminister our choolesproducecleketing star our school is produced folustars you are the only mystic you must come  so okay  so i went there to speak and  and i entered stood up in the courtwangan  and the same orbretof buildings then i suddenly remembered this classroom  s about fifteen years of age one afternoon the teacher is trying to get a response for some question  i hear the sounds but i dont hear the words after some time i don t even hear the sounds don't even see their forms  see all kinds of things  i know their passprehanthandfuture  dont know what he s saying i annoiestheentirvelifebetterthemhim but i don't know what he sang and thirty five forty minutes he desperately tried to get a response from me but those days have made like this sometimes brleedeisfortiys i dont at of a word i not because i am in silence or something when you do know anything what you sick this i dont know anything has grown to such a size it's like you know my mind is billions of questions simply i have a question mark about everything in the ones and not a single answer so then after that i five forty minutes he got so free  he came and held me by the shoulders shook me wilendlylikethis and he said you must either be the divine or the devil i think you are the latter i did not feel abused by this or insulted by this till then my problem   this is that what  that what is that what is that one thing was clear to me this is me suddenly this guy confused me about this also so the land looked like this  i am i i am  evil  i am i he just confused me for the first  i thought this was a so i tried to stare at myself  and work  close mice in his silly manutestoourshitwentdon one day i closed my eyes and sat i thought i sat there for twenty five thirty minutes when i opened my eyes is a huge ground a only indiarngwateistheigordlandsaranmenaronmyneckpe pulling my legs they wanted a well somebody wants to know about his business  one now when his does we get married  said  what the here  come from this have you been sitting here with the deendays in my experience it was only twenty five to ten minutes when i tried to open my legs my knees were stuck it took almost an hour and a half or water so  thing to get my legs straightened out atheuhieven i wondknowbelievtitbuttheinthis had passed in my experience it just felt like twenty five thirty minutes and suddenly what is inside what is outside everything got mixed up clearly till then i was very clear this is me that s you all right and no issue with that one but this is me and that is you  in this idea of what is me and what is not me got all mixed up because what is me was just evidebefh now this looks like a hallucination and thats what i told that i m just losing you going off my rocker i m just losing my mind but every cell in my body bursting with extisy one thing i know is i don t want to lose it it may be madness but i don't want to lose it so right now my whole effort with life is to just above the madness on you  udolsoknow the axtacy of being alive right now you are not etaptitofyourlintellect  i know the ecstasy of being alive you you are a piece of life rest is all arrangements so  why did you make this open  to anheneyour life no no you made this ofventmentmainlytornhande this life you start with education your life would enhance itself with money it would enhance itself would madtieditwouldimmanseitso the children i could ananseitsol now you started the question you know  i wanted to come and meditate but my family my children  as if it's a problem  a execities that you added to enhance your life not to put your life down yes every  and that you made he is about inhasing this life is not that if this life could be in hence from our  you would have

to enhance that life you have to turn inward  really careful people who are with you your family your children the foremost thing that you need to do is you have to enhance this because what is the
