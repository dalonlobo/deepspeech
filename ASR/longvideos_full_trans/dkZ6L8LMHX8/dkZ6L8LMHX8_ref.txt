 good morning sir   namaskaram    two things i ve never been in my life are thin and nervous   and i still haven t been able to get over the former but the latter is still very operational at this moment   it s because i don t know what to say because i feel i ve lived with you in this last week  i ve done all my research  watched all your shows  from   see  you have you have done your homework but because i am homeless   i ve i have not done my homework   i have done a fair amount of my homework  i have watched everyone from anupam kher to juhi chawla in conversation with you  barkha dutt  to a very subdued arnab goswami as well   i do believe in your mystical power because you managed to achieve that and i think that is not anything lesser of an achievement than you ve done  within your span of tremendous work  sadhguru  so my felicitations on that achievement   and more than anything else  when i just saw the av that all of us saw  i ve heard all these terminologies associated with you  which is from the monk on a motorcycle  rockstar spiritual energy  and i saw that happen  you re on a motorbike  you are flying a helicopter  so there are so many terms that i said  rockstar spiritual energy and i want to create my own one say you re like almost the santa claus of spirituality   because you bring the energy through that chimney of life and i think have really touched so many millions of people across the world  so we are blessed to be in your presence at this moment and i can t wait to be in conversation  which is i am going to start  but i just want to start by saying that this is truly an honor  so thank you   i mean  as a filmmaker  as a human being  as a member of a humanitarian community  my head is always buzzing with so many questions and i think we bottle it down to some spiritual inquiries  some religious ones  there s always been a debate about these two terms   religion and then spirituality  there are people who feel like   i m not religious  i m spiritual  and i m not quite sure they know the meaning of that  but they use it because sometimes terms are just thrown around  to those people who are at the crossroad between religion and spirituality  what is your answer to that dilemma   see  we must understand this  it is in the very nature of human intelligence that if you do not know something  if you realize you do not know something   because most people do not realize that they do not know    if you realize that you do not know  it s very natural for your intelligence to seek to know  it doesn t need a guru  it doesn t need a scripture  it doesn t need somebody to introduce that to you  it is in the nature of your intelligence that you wish to know  there re lots of experiments to show  even mice  if you leave them in a place  within two minutes they will research everything in that space   for their own reasons of course  for survival reasons  they  you know  inquire into everything around them to find out how the place is  human intelligence goes beyond survival  so naturally  human intelligence seeks to know many more things  which does not concern our survival  yes  we are concerned about survival till a point  but once that s taken care of  we cannot rest  we want to know more  endlessly more  the more we realize we do not know  the more the longing to know  so this longing to know  when it finds a very intense expression in the form of seeking  we call this spiritual process  or in other words  the basis of spirituality is a realization that   i do not know   but the moment you say   i m religious  you refer to yourself as a believer  when you say you re a believer  what you are saying is   everything that i do not know  i will make it up  how i make it up  whose help i seek to make it up  may be varying from person to person  somebody makes it up because of  with spiritual assist with scriptural assistance  somebody makes it up with the assistance of a priest  or a pundit  or a guru  or whatever  but you seek some authority  you kind of make some compromise in your life  that instead of truth  you settle for an authority as the truth  spiritual process means truth is the only authority for you  authority is never the truth for you  so these are two different aspects  unfortunately spoken in the same breath most of the time  so  i would say spiritual process is far closer to scientific inquiry  see  even the fly is trying to investigate me    trust me  i am not investigating   i am just inquiring and i wish i was the size of that fly but anyway   no  no i did not i did not use the word investigation in a negative way  nothing wrong with investigation  investigation means you want to know the truth  maybe it s done little forcefully like a fly   he s coming to you now    that s all i get these days    no  if you get to fly  what more    well  you manage pretty well  i have a fear of turbulence   so flying is really not on my top three things to do in life   so  spiritual process does not demand belief because belief and spiritual process cannot go together  spiritual process is a constant inquiry to it is a way of sharpening your questions  so they dig deeper and deeper   not into something else but into yourself  the nature of your existence  because the nature of human existence is such that in our experience  the only thing that you can experience is yourself  you actually believe you re experiencing many things  but you only know everything the way it happens within you  you do not know any other way  even now if you see these people  it looks like they are there  but actually you know them or you see them only the way they re projected in the firmament of our minds  there is no other way  there is no other way for you to experience this life   except the way it happens within you  now spiritual process is a constant effort to see that the way that it happens within me is not a distorted vision  that my mirror is not a wonky mirror  it is a plain mirror   that it shows me things the way they  way things are  it doesn t distort anything  because of my thought  because of my emotion  because of my attachments  because of my identities  because of the philosophies and ideologies that i identify with  i can distort my mirror  now  i deprive myself of all that  so that i have a plain mirror and i get to see everything just the way it is  this is spiritual process   no  well  thank you because that s always been a continued dilemma  and i believe that the word spirituality is sometimes misused  where there is not a grave understanding of what it really is  and as you said  that the  i don t know  has immense power and i think acknowledging the  i don t knows  of your life really means everything and i wish people would start doing that because according to me  sometimes delusion is the biggest disease that plagues humanity   when you re not aware of your own self   no  there are  there are all kinds of idiots on the planet    yeah  we work with many of them    but we must understand this  in the very nature of who we are  it is such  like this  if you do something stupid today  tonight your intelligence will bother you   why did i do this  this is the nature of human intelligence  but the moment your stupidity is either scripture endorsed or god endorsed  you can go on doing the same idiotic thing with enormous confidence  it gives you confidence without clarity  confidence without clarity is a disastrous process  if you do not have clarity  at least you must have hesitation    yes that s true   well  i have to say that i was   i want to personalize this a little bit   i was at a crossroad about thirteen years ago and my father was very critically ill  and at that juncture of my life and before that  religion was organized in my life  it was what was taught to me  it was what i thought the right thing to do was  when he was in his last stage  there were things suggested to me  which were to me now completely ridiculous  including going to a certain temple and feeding a cow of a certain color and doing a certain ritual at home and all those things that one did even without even thinking  because as you said  when you spoke about the idiots on this planet  i was definitely one of those in that stage in my life  but sometimes you reach a critical stage  where you seek any kind of desperate measure and you try to kind of hold on to any hope  that even something that is advocated to you that goes against your grain of intelligence or thought  to those people  what is your advice  who have reached the end of their rope and are hanging on and holding on to anything  be it religious  be it spiritual  or be it an unfounded piece of advice   see  for all this  the fundamental basis of these kind of aspirations or actions is because people are just shit scared of life  why is it so  it s like this  suppose you sat on a bicycle  on stand  you know  and started simply pedaling for fun  but it came off the stand and started rolling   anxiety  faster   fear  very fast   terror  the fundamental reason is but someone who knows how to ride a bicycle  the faster it goes  the better it is  but for someone who does not know how to ride a bicycle  the moment it moves  terror will happen  so the fundamental thing is just this  you have been given a very complex and sophisticated vehicle to pass through the process of this life  which is human mechanism  there is body  mind  emotion  energy  many dimensions to it  essentially  this human mechanism is a very complex phenomena  now you are going at it  you are trying to walk through life without understanding a thing about the vehicle that you are using  every time it moves  there is terror  if it doesn t move  you want to die of boredom  if it moves  you re terrorized  there is no way out of it  tell me one thing  tell me one thing that human beings are not suffering  if they are poor  they suffer poverty  if they become rich  they suffer taxes  if they are not educated  they suffer that  you send them to school  endless suffering   they are not married  they suffer that  you get them married     yeah  i was heading to that next   i didn t say a thing  they are the ones   well  that s an extreme validation of the institution    so  tell me one thing that they re not suffering  so now somebody develops a philosophy   life is suffering  you know  there are philosophies like this   now it s not about life because you ve not even touched life yet  all that you re dabbling with is right now your own thought and emotion and it s going crazy  so  you are on a bicycle that you don t know how to ride  but this  is not just a simple two wheeled bicycle  it s a complex machine  you don t know how to ride  you don t know how to manage your thought  you don t know how to manage your emotion  all these things  human experience is essentially happening from within you  whether it s misery or joy  agony or ecstasy is happening from within you  at least what happens from within you must happen your way  isn t it  the world will not happen your way  but the problem now is what happens within you is not happening yeur  your way  what s happening in your mind is a dream  even your dream is not happening your way  that s the problem   the problem is not that your life is not happening your way  even your dream is not happening your way  and this is the source of their misery but they think it s marriage  they think it s children  they think it s poverty   no  fundamentally  it is just that you are not happening the way you want yourself to be  that s all your misery is  so  even if you want to learn to ride a bicycle  it s a simple basic machine  it needs a certain level of attention and involvement  otherwise you can t ride a bicycle  takes an enormous amount of intent to want to ride it  otherwise it s quite impossible to ride a bicycle  after you know how to ride it  you can let your hands off  you can close your eyes and do all these things   pretty much like marriage  because like wheels are turning but going nowhere   at times    no  no  i wouldn t like to make that statement  because for a many people they have gotten somewhere with marriage    yes  we d like to find out where   but on another forum  when you speak about suffering  sadhguru  it is definitely something that i believe that self pity sometimes is like a luxury spa  it s somewhere where your comfort lies  self pity is i believe the most indulgent emotion and gets you nowhere but makes you feel really good for a certain period of time  what is your take on something like self pity   how is being pitiful a luxury  i don't understand that   it becomes  you know you get great solace in that emotion  for a short period of time  self pity can be the most happy place to be at  like self indulgences   see  there are many ways to achieve piece  happiness  well being  tch  this happened  shankaran pillai   in his he was a little abusive husband  verbally abusive  so he would rant at his wife but she was always peaceful  never reacted  one day in the middle of his raging rant  he stopped and he asked   whatever i say  how much ever i abuse you  you are peaceful  how do you do this  she said   i clean the toilet  he said   what  cleaning the toilet  how does it make you peaceful  she said   i use your toothbrush    so  don t fall on to that  you are giving lots of people ideas   so that s not a relationship  it s a revenge story    no  you can achieve peace and solace in so many different ways  i am saying    which is what you said  to draw from within to find your solutions  because the most exciting line that i read was that life can t touch you  can t scratch you  it can t harm you  you create your own energy in your own life  you re in this universe  you ve been brought into this world and it s in your control  what you do with it  life has nothing against you  what you achieve and what you do is a result of your own actions  your feelings  the pleasantness that you create within yourself  which to me was a very moving line because it simplified a very extensive and expansive feeling of anxiety  fear and all the turbulence that humanity goes through on a daily basis  to me  three pillars of our existence are pretty much family  fortune and farishta  which is what i believe result of god  religion  everything else  when we talk about family  sadhguru  there are few things that have always intrigued me and i seek answers or rather validation from a higher energy such as yourself  it s like i ve always questioned why there s an organic distance between a father and son  why there is always that angst in that relationship  and i am sure there are many in this house that have experienced that emotion in their own homes  in their own environment  where do you think the origin of that distance came   because every generation makes the same mistake   which means they re not learning at all   when we say family you know  in italy  family meant crime   crime   yeah  mafia was always referred to as the family   family   yes  so in a way  it s a kind of crime  it is the most basic institution in the making of a society  but it does not mean you must remain basic  because this is a biological identity that we have  biology is a reality  we can t deny it  obviously this  was in some way  at least to a certain extent  our parents gave this  to us  one part of it at least  today the way it is  the way it looks is essentially because of them  well  it was given to them by somebody else  that s another point  but to us  it was given by them  so it s a biological identity  this limiting oneself to one s biological idetity identity for an entire lifetime is  is a crime because it creates so many things  in this country this country has suffered a lot from a long time  just now you released the mahabharat video  entire mahabharat is family problem  it is dhritarashtra syndrome  we are still suffering    my son is best  no matter what  even today we are suffering the same thing   my son is best and he should become the king  no matter what  it s not just   some sons haven t managed very well  some have    so  family is a basic identity that we are born with  it s a wonderful thing when you are a child because without that family support  you wouldn t be who you are today in many ways  okay  with all due respect and regard and great respect for the family because human creature is born in such a way that as soon as you fall out of your mother s womb  you are not ready get up on your feet and do things like other creatures  it needs a long gestation period before a man becomes a man or a woman becomes a woman  there is a long period  where the incubation of family is most important and vital  there s no question about that  but you re supposed to grow beyond that identity  but a whole lot of people just never grow beyond that identity  for which they suffer and sometimes if they re born in certain places  they make the entire nation suffer   you are supposed to grow out of that  as a child  it s most vital that you are identified with the family  but as an adult  you re supposed to grow beyond your biology because biology is the most basic identity  one has to grow beyond that  so having said that  is it necessary that every father and every son has to have some kind of angst  it is not about father and son  it is just two men being accommodated in the same home   when you were eight  ten  your father was godlike  so this problem started after you became fifteen  sixteen  when you want to be a man and there s not enough space  this big man is occupying too much space  and that man thinks   this is my space and who is this    they can t recognize each other as father and son because now there are there is no father and son  there are two men in the same house and there s not enough space  this happens not in just human families  every creature  whether it s an elephant  or a buffalo  or whatever  in every creature s life  this happens that there ll be some friction and either the younger one goes out or the older one goes out  this happens everywhere because this is not a problem between father and son  this is two men trying to share the same space and the same woman called mother to one and wife to the other     two men  well  that certainly breaks a strong myth that this country has operated with because the problem was always meant to be two women  in the same house and you just changed it on its head  which i believe is true  because i believe the problem lies in the fact that two men can t be accommodated   no  it also happens between women in a different way  but women have a way of covering their frictions in certain way  they do it in a certain way  in a feminine way  men will do it in more   head to  head on  head butting is the man s way  woman s way is different  she will do it differently  but the friction happens   and i feel it s always like the mother energy of the house that sometimes has to bear the brunt of this tussle in a family  it s also the other thing that an offshoot of that thought is that i believe very strongly that the people you love the most  you kind of tend to dump all your anxieties  your angers  your fears  your insecurities  all onto that one source that gives you the maximum love and the one that you love the most  why is it that we as a human race tend to do that  tend to lumber all our negative emotions on our most positive light source   no  no  because if you try to dump it on someone on the street  they ll smash you up    so  you are choosing a  a safe place   but is that always fair   first of all  it s not fair for you to carry anxieties and angsts and angers and problems within you because see  if i try to torture you  you have some defense against me  either you will fight me  or you will run away  or you ll do something  you have some kind of defense  but if you start torturing yourself  this  is the most helpless creature  no most defenseless  i m telling you  even an unborn child  if you poke like this   he responds  he defends himself in his own little way  okay  but this one  is completely defenseless  when you start poking yourself  this  is a completely defenseless life  so the worst kind of torture  the lowest level of mind is one who tortures himself  but they always think they are the highest level of people   i suffer for everybody    you bloody suffer anyway   if there is everybody  you will dump it on them  otherwise you ll simply suffer   people come to me and say   sadhguru   i can t bear with my  you know  my mother in law  she is impossible   my husband  after all  her son  my wife  oh   she is terror for me  my boss  he is not even human    like this  it goes on  i tell them   you come  don t worry  i ll give you a nice place to stay  i ll give you good food  nothing to do  for your life  i ll take care of you  only thing is  i will make some random checks on you  when i check  you must be joyful  if you re miserable  i don t believe in feeding misery    so  you leave them in one place for twenty four hours  you will see how they will mess themselves up  so when you re alone  if you re miserable  you are obviously in bad company   now you are thinking   because of this person  i am suffering  because of that person  i am suffering  just stay alone by yourself  without any entertainment  without texting  without television  without reading  simply sit in one place joyfully  let me see  most people can t stay there for five minutes  believe me  they are not on facebook  they are not on twitter  they re not this thing because they have something to say or because they have fallen in love with the world   no  if they stay alone  they ll go crazy  that s a fact   what is  i mean  sorry to break that train of thought  but what is the solution to that kind of feeling of just not enjoying your own space   because we have not looked at how human mechanism works  it is like you have a super sophisticated machine this  the super super computer out of this  is the machine  which dripped super computers  isn t it  i am asking  have you read the user s manual   that s all it is  the entire yogic system is just this  this is not a philosophy  this is not an ideology  this is not a religion  this is not a teaching  this is just the user s manual  how to how your body should sit  how it must breathe  how the mind should be  how the emotions should be  how the energy should be  what are the things you can do with it  how should you keep it so that this  will function at its highest possible level  see  the cellphone companies have been doing some research a few years ago and they found only seven percent or only three percent of the people no  ninety seven percent of the people are using only seven percent of the cellphone s capability  we are not even talking about today s smartphones  we re talking about the dumb phones  so ninety seven percent of the people are using only seven percent of a small gadget  if that is the fact  how much do you believe are people making use of this tremendous gadget   just on the surface because they are never bothered to read the user s manual  if you tell them this  they say   sadhguru  can you give us the user s manual  it s written into you  you have to spend some time with this    this was written by the source of creation  not by me or you  isn t it  you must learn to read  the problem is illiteracy  see  suppose you are  you do not  you have not learnt the alphabet  well  you have learnt english alphabet  let s say i ll give you a tamil book  you look at it  does it make any sense to you  you don t know the alphabet  it doesn t make a  doesn t mean a thing to you because you do not know the alphabet  now  this is the problem  that in today s society  in modern education  we have not even brought fundamental literacy towards how to read this book   because we ve never read this   by accident we are managing it  if you manage by accident  sometimes it works  sometimes it doesn t work  one moment you are happy  next moment you are miserable  one moment you are peaceful  another moments you are in turmoil  i was    you know  i ll cut the long story short   i was in tel aviv and somebody came and greeted me   shalom  i said   what does that mean  he said   this is the highest way of greeting  i said   that s your opinion but what does it mean  he said   no  no  no  this is really the highest way of greeting  i said   all right but what does the word mean  he said   it means peace  then i say   why is peace the highest way of greeting unless you are born in middle east    in south india  you come up to me in the morning and say   peace  i will ask   what s wrong with you    i am saying if you deprive yourself of something for a long time  suddenly it becomes godlike  if you have not eaten for ten days  even if god appeared  what s the prayer   food  of course  so  once you deprive yourself of fundamental things i am saying fundamental things because to be peaceful and joyful is not the ultimate goal of life  if you want to enjoy your meal  you must be peaceful and joyful  if you want to enjoy your friend  you must be peaceful and joyful  if you want to enjoy your walk on the street  you must be peaceful and joyful  if you want to enjoy simple things that you do in your life  you must be at least peaceful and joyful  if not ecstatic  so it is a most fundamental requirement  this is not happening  people are saying this is the ultimate goal of life  even so called spiritual leaders are saying   peace is the ultimate goal of life  such people will only rest in peace    in what i believe surrounds us all is urban angst   i think that seems to be terminology that comes out of mental health solutions  et cetera  and that seems to be rampant in many parts of the world now  including now slowly penetrating even in india  when people deal with mental health issues like depression and anxiety  and those  seek certain chemical imbalance issues that are told to them about  hey  they re making you look very pretty on the screen  how do they do that  they re not doing it to me    they are making my what  my    look at yourself there   am i looking pretty on screen   yeah  yeah  see   okay    they re not doing that to me    you are actually looking stunning to me  sir    stunning is another word for shocking    well  i was trying to find another adjective to counter that   but back to me and my mental health issue   i really want to know  it s such an order of the day today  everyone seems to kind  it s almost and i hate to say this with any and i don t say this with any kind of disrespect to people s personal circumstance  but i almost feel like today it s talked about like it s almost a fashionable issue  where i think it s a very serious issue  when people talk about mental health issues like depression and anxiety and seek counseling to sort those issues out  and then the diagnosis at times is chemical imbalance and medication is given  what and then your well  i know you hate the word philosophy  but all your teachings are definitely about finding yourself and seeking that pleasantness from within  but to those who are not strong enough to achieve that and seek this assistance  what is your take on that   let me correct one more thing in the question  this is this is not a teaching  this is just a technology  i am just giving people simple methods with which they can work  if people are coming for a teaching  they re frustrated with me because every time they come  they leave more confused than ever before   if they look if they are more confused  in a way my job is done because  my entire work is to get them out of silly conclusions  that they have made about life  and confusion means you are still looking  you have an active intelligence  conclusions means what is the conclusion of your life  hello  what is the conclusion of your life  you don t know  let me reveal the suspense to you  though as a filmmaker he won t tell you till the end   i will reveal it to you  sometimes we don t even know what happens after that so   many of us are confused souls when we make movies   so  the conclusion of your life is you ll be dead   you think something else is going to happen to you   you ll be just dead  that s all is the conclusion  so every time you make a conclusion  in some way you die  you need to understand this  you kill something of yourself every time you make a conclusion  this is you in a state of committing suicide in installments  you may call this religion  you may call this philosophy  you may call this being socially whatever  but fundamentally you re committing suicide in installments  this is why when you look at a child and yourself  you are less alive than a child  as you grow up  should you become more alive or less alive  unfortunately  most adults are less alive than children  isn t it  you must be more alive but unfortunately you re less alive  maybe your physical agility will go down with age but your aliveness need not go down  aliveness is going down because you re continuously making conclusions and conclusions and conclusions  as you conclude  you become less and less alive  you know that there is that famous parable  which is all over the place  about adam and eve  it seems god told them it s a dumb couple   kind of   look at what we had to suffer as a result of them    no  no  not because of that  because they didn t know what to do with each other   so  god told them   you eat whatever you want  but don t eat from this particular tree  you know what tree that was   apple   no  apple means in old english just a fruit   knowledge   what  knowledge  your parents tell you  you must eat the fruit of knowledge  your teachers insist that you must eat the fruit of knowledge  everybody in the society always trying to shove knowledge down your throat  but in  it seems god told you not to eat the fruit of knowledge and by eating that  that adam and eve fell  it is not about that adam and that eve  it s about every adam and every eve  the moment you eat the fruit of knowledge  you fall because your idea of a knowledge is the conclusions that you make about everything in the universe   so this mental illness which is becoming pandemic they are telling me   i don't know how far these statistics are right   they are telling me over forty people  particularly women in america  over forty years of age  nearly fifty two percent of them are on some kind of antidepressants  fifty two percent is not a joke  fifty two percent is not a joke   it means entire humanity is becoming sick  we must look at it  why  fundamentally  because you are banking on a few things for a long time for your mental stability and emotional stability  all these things are taken away  one thing is  as you mentioned the crime that we call as family  it gave us the support  no matter what happened  there was somebody always for you  others are with you when you do the right things  if you do the wrong thing  they ll distance themselves  there was one bunch of people  who was like a  for the circus that you do  they were the net  whichever way you fall  there s somebody to hold you for some moments  but that net is gone  now when you fall  you fall  because of that  people are cracking up  so if you want to remove see  in this culture  there was a time in the tradition  where thirty percent of india s population were monks  that means consciously they went beyond family  consciously they chose to live without family  to live without support  to live without a home  homelessness not out of deprivation but by choice  nobody ever had a depression  because they transcended the need for the net  you learnt your trapeze bar act really well  now you can do it without the net  you are not good at it  you better have a net  isn t it   otherwise your head will crack  right now  that s all that s happening  the traditional support system that we had  we re taking it off  when we talked about religion  with all due respect  we must acknowledge this  today people are trying to go to psychiatrists  india doesn t have enough psychiatrists for one billion people  believe me  no country has  and above all  they re very inefficient because they can take only one client at a time and they need lot of furniture like this   it s very inefficient  religion handled human psychological balance effortlessly   god is with you  don t worry  it settled a whole lot of people  do not underestimate the value of that  it is very inexpensive mass psychiatry  where people  no people no  no  i m not this is not a joke  when you are mentally ill  it s not a joke  it s a most painful thing  if you get physical ailments  you will get everybody s compassion  when you get mental ailment  you ll get laughter  you know  unfortunately  because you don t know when somebody is sick and when somebody is being stupid  tch  you can t make out  this is the biggest problem for those families  who have somebody in the family  who is mentally disturbed  you don t know when they are making it up  when they are really suffering  you can t make out  there is no perfect way  there is no science anywhere to tell you exactly when because human beings can make up every kind of thing  you are an actor  you know  i don't know  you  you are actor or   i do most things  yeah   okay    we act even in our day to day existence  all of us do    no  that is fine  but are you actor  just director   no  no  i tried  i failed    okay  so  all right  you are a bad actor    yeah  but i am an actor nonetheless   but at least you make other people act   yes   so  you know  in a cinema or drama  you can act something and make it really real to a point  where these 10000 people will sit and experience like it s real  so  when a mentally ill person is in your home  you don t know whether he s acting it up or it s real  sometimes it s real  sometimes he s playing with it  you can t make out  you don t know when to be compassionate  when to be hard on him  this is the biggest problem for people  who have mentally ill people in  within their homes  this is the huge problem because there is no perfect way of making a judgment  and it is not joke  see  human sanity is a very fragile thing  the line between sanity and insanity is so thin  if you push it every day  you will cross it  see  when you get angry  what do you say  what s the expression   i am mad with you  or  i am mad right now  so you are enjoying that little bit of madness  you crossed the line and it felt like it s some kind of a freedom and power  but one day when you cannot cross back  that is when suffering begins  and suffering means  it s not like physical pain  it s immense suffering  i have been around people who have been mentally ill  trying to help them  it is nobody should have it  but unfortunately  it s becoming an epidemic in the world  that mental illnesses are growing like never before because all the supports they had we are pulling it out without replacing it  if people become so conscious and so capable within themselves  you pull all the supports  everything will be fine  but without giving that competence  you just pull the supports  people will crack  in the western societies  it s happening large scale  we are not going to be far behind  especially the urban societies in india will move in this direction because once again in many ways  urban india is more west than west  there are more people in denims here than in america    well  no  thank you  thank you for that because i know it is definitely a crisis that plagues us and some  as i said  seek help  some who are helped  i am happy for them and i am sure grateful for resources that are available  and those that find pleasantness within themselves  i think that truly is a glorious solution to their issues  see  when we say pleasantness  human pleasantness can be looked at in many different ways  one simple way of looking at it   because medical science is looking at it that way  i don t see it that way  but that s a consequence for me   is every human experience has a chemical basis to it  what you call as peace  joy  love  turmoil  tranquility  agony  ecstasy  everything has a chemical balance  chemical basis to it  even health and ill health has a chemical basis to it  today entire pharmacology is just about trying to manage your health by using chemicals  it s a  today or  a doctor s or a physician s job is  it s an orchestra of chemistry that he s trying to manage  put this pill  something more happened  put that pill  then something less happened  then do this  do that   trying to manage the orchestra of chemistry because this  is the most complex chemical factory on the planet  this  is a very complex chemical factory  managing it from outside is  very  very difficult  but you could manage it from inside  but you must have access to your insides if your innards are not available to you  then how do you manage it from inside  you only try to manage it from outside  all  even mental illness is a largely being managed by chemical input  but all the chemicals that you can think of on this planet are in some way already present in this   whether you are seeking medically prescribed drugs or you re going for the backstreet drugs  whatever you are going  essentially you are trying to bring pleasantness within yourself because health means one level of pleasantness  if  if body becomes pleasant  we call this health  if it becomes very pleasant  we call this pleasure  if your mind becomes pleasant  we call this peace  if it becomes very pleasant  we call this joy  if your emotions become pleasant  you call this love  if it becomes very pleasant  we call it compassion  if your very energies become pleasant  we call this bliss  if it becomes very pleasant  we call it ecstasy  if your surroundings become pleasant  we call this success   so  we are trying to manage pleasantness by putting chemicals  to what extent means   these statistics are out now   in united states  they are saying seventy percent of the population is on some kind of prescription medication  the  most affluent country  where there is enormous choice of nourishment and lifestyles  here seventy percent are on prescription medication  so you are trying to manage your sanity and your health by putting chemicals from outside  but there is no doubt in anybody s mind today that this  is the greatest chemical factory   but right now ill managed  essentially  you are a lousy ceo    that is true  what has always  sadhguru  has also left me in wonderment at times about the usage of two words  which i am going to say it to you right now  terminology sometimes has a tendency of making you even receive an emotion from within  two words being ego and self respect  now these are two pillars of  what we believe is self confidence  which is unfounded  i believe  ego  hey  who put a cow next to me    sorry   who put a cow next to me   put a  well  topical at least   it s part of the d cor or something   because everywhere i go  people have been asking me questions about gau rakshak  gau rakshak   now they put a cow next to me    well  i was planning not to go down that path but now  then since you brought it up  no  no  not going there  as i was saying about ego and self respect  like we always say  like my belief has always been that maintain your self respect  keep that  your ego can be flexible because it should be convenient  because i believe like your ego should be a function of your convenience   how true is that or maybe both are unfounded   this ego should be a function of your convenience is perfect  but nobody knows where ego is within themselves  do you know   no   nobody knows   it arises at will  i think   no  no  no  ego is a fall guy  when you do the good things  it s of course it s you who did it  when you do nasty things  oh  it was my ego  he is a fall guy  he comes up whenever something goes wrong   whenever you are seen in a bad light   it was my ego  it s not me  so  people have created a whole lot of jargon like this   my ego  my self  my consciousness  my super consciousness  many things  first everybody must decide within this body of yours  how many people are residing  you must tell me   if there is anything more than one  it means you  either you are schizophrenic or you are possessed   you need either a psychiatrist or an exorcist   so you are an individual  an individual means not further divisible   indivisible  this is why you are an individual  that means there is only one  this is the healthiest state to be  that you understand there is only you here  nobody else but you  if you realize this  then you will function completely differently  but you start playing this game   whenever you are in difficulty  you say   it was my ego  whenever something else happens  you say   it s myself  another time you say   my lower self  higher self    all kinds of stuff  many identities within you  see  this is the nature of a criminal   alias  alias  alias  alias  you know  so  it s a crime that you started  whether you will be caught in the web of that or you will manage doing see  if you do minimal amount of crime  you may manage  only when you really get into it  then you may get into the web  otherwise  many people commit small time crime and then become very respectable in the society   so  if you do little crime of ego business  self business  all this and then become normal  you re okay  but if you play it too much  you will become mentally ill  because if there is more than one in this   you will become sick  there you are an individual  you are just one  now it s very easy to transform this   you can t transform a crowd of people  you can only transform individual people   and if you take away this fall guy  one fundamental thing you have to do with yourself is to see that no matter what happens in my life  if pleasant things happen  if unpleasant things happen  whether i am joyful or miserable  i m successful or a failure  you know it s just you  you and you alone  otherwise  when things happen well   me  when things don t happen well   so you say we always tend to blame ourselves into various parts and then divine forces as well   it s convenient  it s very convenient  but this self respect   no  no  you should have no self respect  others  respect is from another person   i respect myself    what is this rubbish   somebody else respects you because they see some value to you  it s nice   but  i respect myself    what is this  this is  this is  it s gone further in the west and people say   i love myself  see  to respect  to love  the very word they are using is there must be two  you can love somebody  somebody can love you  you can respect somebody  somebody can respect you  but  i love myself  i respect myself  this terminology is the terminology of the insane  but it s becoming popular because the numbers are growing    by the hour    hey  don t say by the hour   then we will be blamed   by the day    by the day  okay  we get that  we sign seal and deliver that   is there a ceiling to extremity  to extreme emotion like love  when you love something  is there a time that you have to stop  is there any such thing as stopping the extent of your extreme emotion  and i feel that about even the negative emotions  when you love someone  how do you really stop the extent of it   i would say please  i want you to listen to this carefully because you will immediately tweet   sadhguru said this    it s a dangerous world today  if you love  love strong  if you hate  hate strong  whatever the hell you do  live strong  it s very important  otherwise  you will live an insipid life   not knowing a thing about anything  in when adiyogi gave the yogic principles  he said anything in your life  it doesn t matter what i have been telling people  they re not grasping it  they think  because too much this  you know  what to say  flowery teachings have gone into people  they re not looking at what works and what doesn t work  they want something pretty  i am not interested in what s pretty and not pretty  whether it works or not is the only thing  ultimately  what works is very fantastic   so  even if it s anger   not necessarily love or compassion  even if it is anger   just stay on it for twenty four hours  anybody  i m saying just try this by yourself  twenty four hours stay intensely angry  let me see  believe me  at the end of twenty four hours or well before that  you will be enlightened  but you will see you are not capable of being angry because to stay intensely angry  you need enormous energy  it burns you up  try one day  twenty four hours stay angry  you are irritated  that you can manage for the rest of your life   stay angry  really super angry for twenty four hours  let me see  you can t manage more than three minutes  believe me  you will feel drained out because it takes enormous energy  there are yogis  who live like this  they are simply angry all the time  all the time  not about anybody or anything  simply angry  just like that  it works wonderfully  it works much better and quicker than love  only thing is  with that kind of practice within you  with that kind of emotion within you  you can t live in social atmospheres  you ll have to withdraw to a mountain cave and simply be angry about nothing  just like that  if you want to live in social atmospheres  you need to be in a pleasant state of emotion  otherwise you will get into constant mess  so  should i stop myself somewhere  what you are asking is   should i be constipated about my love    at least in love  know some sense of abandon  that there is no brakes on it  i would say on everything in your life in your car  you must pull out all the pedals  only throttle should be there  yes  in your life  there should be only throttle because brake will happen when you die  it s not for you to brake every day   it s not for you to control  your life will be curtailed somewhere  that s nature s business  your business is to be full on because life  life needs your support  death is super efficient  did you ever see death happening inefficiently  hello   wherever it happened it was a perfect death  isn t it   never happened inefficiently but life happens inefficiently  life needs constant support  death does not need your support  stopping something is death in a way  so to love  you re afraid  to laugh  you re afraid  to cry you re afraid  to everything  nothing is done with abandon  everything with constipation   learn to do something with abandon because if you do not know at least how to scream in abandon  there is no way you will ever know how to meditate or to be spiritual  because spirituality is a state of total abandon  complete state of abandon    i endorse that and i will try and live by that  but what happens when a positive emotion reaches its extreme stage  and ventures into a dark area  like love can also transfer itself into obsession   see  you are referring to see  it s like this  suppose you don t have legs and if i say   come  dance  you say   no  i cannot even walk without my crutch  so  i cannot walk without my crutch  or  i cannot live without you  are not different  this is a very dangerous territory i am entering   but it is a fact   i cannot walk without a crutch  or  i cannot live without you  is the same thing because you re misunderstanding your dependence and a certain relationship that you hold with somebody as love  let s look at this thing of what is love  see  it s a certain blossoming within you  now  who are you in your life  who are you using as the manure  filth  see  this flower is fragrant  not because somebody sprayed perfume to the roots  it is fragrant because somebody put filth to the roots  isn t it  so now  you found a little flower within you of love  who is your manure  who is your filth  now this is a dangerous territory for me to enter with you also   but this is exactly what we are doing  now the question is just this  whatever is the most pleasant emotion within you  are you capable of bringing it on by yourself  or are you in a dilapidated condition of technology  that you are a push start machine  that somebody has to push you  otherwise you cannot be  your joy  your love  your peace  your ecstasy must be your making  isn t it  so now  your love will become about sharing your joy  not squeezing joy out of somebody  right now  most people s joy  most people s idea of a love affair is more like a mutual benefit scheme    you give me this  i ll give you that  you can t live without me  i can t live without you  they will make sure that the other person also becomes invalid and cannot live without me  yes  this is a very  a very huge problem in the human societies  love is not happening as a flowering  it is something that we are trying to suck out of somebody  love is not about somebody  i want you to know this  maybe because you re a film personality maybe you said you are not an actor but there are many actors  who are loved by people  people are in  drooling with ecstasy simply looking at them  but the problem is they ve never seen them  they ve only seen that play of light and sound  they ve never seen them but they love them  so what i am saying is  you are capable of loving somebody  that person may not exist  he may be animated  but you still love and you are experiencing all the fruits of love  i am saying  love is something that you do within yourself and blame it on somebody   you can do it by yourself  for a long time in this country  it s been there  there have been meerabais and tukarams and others  they taught you  you don t have  to love and to be in an extreme state of love  you don t need anybody  you can simply do it by yourself  and not just in emotion  even physical ecstasies happened to them  simply because they are in a great love affair with someone who is not even here  all right  so  it is something that you do within yourself  right now  you are in love with somebody here  that somebody may not even know that you love them  but you can experience this  isn t it  you don t need the support from the other person  this is an experience that s happening within you  love is within you if you wish  it is not that it s sitting within you  there is no such thing  you are capable of variety of emotions  if you want  you can make it's very sweet emotion  if you are in a very sweet state of emotion  people say   oh  he s very loving  you may not be loving in the real context of how they understand  but you are in a pleasant state of emotion  so naturally you do pleasant things  so people think you love them   so make love an island  not a country   no  no  make love the universe  not an island   because right now  when you say  i love you  this particular person  you only  when i look at these people  i look at them like this   this one person  ahh   this is an island love   it is too discriminatory  this one face in these 10000 faces i love  rest   depressing looking at them  this is a very island love  i know you are in an island city  but it s time   to go beyond    it s time that you understand love is a happening within you  maybe somebody stimulated this  you are grateful for them that they ignited this within you  but love affair is yours  isn t it  it s an inner experience that s happening to you  somebody is providing the stimulus  we are grateful to them  that they are providing this  but they are not causing it  it s been caused from within  and once you understand this  why wouldn t you be walking on the street lovingly  why wouldn t you look at a tree lovingly  why wouldn t you look at a buffalo lovingly  why wouldn t you look at the cloud lovingly  because it is not something that ll get over   should i control it  why  will it get over  there is no such danger  it doesn t get over  in fact  almost everything that you experience  the more you exercise it  the more it s available to you  whether it s your love  or joy  or hate  or anger  the more you exercise it  the more it s available to you because it s after all your making  it s entirely your making  so when it s your making  why don t you enjoy it every moment of your life  somebody is there  nobody is there  what is the problem    well  that brings me to  i think the i believe the mother of a virus that plagues a large part of humanity is expectation  i have a simple theory that i try to expect less because then i feel that i ll be disappointed less   and i feel to curtail your expectation is possibly the toughest thing to do because we constantly expect from relationships  from the work we do  from   you are just talking to the wrong guy about this expectation   i have the highest expectation of every human being on the planet  and i know  and i know they will disappoint me  i will die disappointed but joyfully disappointed    now joyful disappointment is a place  sir  that you ve reached   but that is not a easy place to reach for most of us   no  no  no  see  these things are not like that  to be joyful or miserable is essentially your choice  it s a choice that you are making within yourself  maybe it s an unconscious choice  anything that you do unconsciously right now  unconsciously my hand can fly  but what i can do unconsciously  i can do the same thing definitely consciously also  isn t it  tch  this is the fundamental difference between being human and every other creature  we are not doing anything different from what they are doing  we are doing the same things  but we do it little more consciously  suddenly it s a different affair altogether  same things   we eat  they eat  they sleep  we sleep  they reproduce  we reproduce  they die  we die  only thing is we are doing it little more consciously  suddenly it looks like another world by itself  we think we are above them only because we can do the same silly little things little more consciously  so  if i can move my hand unconsciously  i can also move it consciously  if i can become joyful unconsciously  i can also become joyful consciously  if i am joyful because of my choice  suppose disappointments are thrown at me  i will be joyfully disappointed   and my expectations of people are very  very high  i have an impossible expectation  so i know i will die joyfully  blissfully disappointed because i know the nature of the world very well  i am not somebody who lives in fancy la la land    so  abundant love and no curtail on expectation   oh see  love is not a quantity  it s a quality  it is not that if you do certain amount of things  you are loving  there is no such thing  you can sit here  eyes closed  not look at anybody and still be loving because it s essentially pleasantness of your emotion  how pleasant  i am asking  is there any need to curtail pleasantness within you  now i am super pleasant  but if a child came  i may grab him and put him on my lap  if an adult comes  you don t do that   i ll do this   okay  here dog came  i ll just do this   but an adult comes  another person comes  you don t do this  to them  i am saying your expression will change from person to person  from relationship to relationship  what kind of intimacy and what kind of closeness you have with people  but does it mean to say that you should not this  with as much love as you hug somebody or kiss somebody  should you not  should you not do namaskaram with as much love as you hugged your child  why not  i am asking  because there is no see  this  i m  i m trying to demolish the word abundance because when you say abundance  there is also scarcity  there is no such thing  it is neither abundant nor scarce  if you are willing  it s on  if you are not willing  it s off  that s all    as simple as that   fundamentally  there is always a need  a need for so many things  even when  in your process  your professional process or where you garner wealth or income and you keep going  there is a need to constantly get more than what you have  there is no satisfaction and a place to stop  is there an end to need   no  no  no  there should not be an end  it is just that now that you are asking this question  in some way you have realized that at every point of your life  you thought   this is it  if this one thing happens  i am fulfilled  but the very next day you realize that this is not it  there is one more thing and one more thing  and you know that after ten years still the same state will continue  so this means you are ready for yoga   this means you have understood that your longing is not for more  your longing is for all  your longing to expand is not just for more  it is for all  or in other words  your longing is in some way for infinite expansion  if you handle your infinite expansion unconsciously and if it finds a very basic physical expression  we call this sexuality  what you are trying to do is  something that is not you  with physical contact you are trying to make it a part of yourself  you know it doesn t work  if you try emotionally  we call this love  emotionally you are trying to include something which is not you as a part of yourself  this is your love affair  if you do it mentally  this gets labeled as greed  ambition  conquest or simply shopping   if you do it consciously  then we call this yoga  yoga means union  you re longing to expand infinitely but because of little constipation in the head  you are going in installments  can you go in installments and become infinite  i am asking  is it possible  can you count one  two  three  four and one day say infinity  no  you will become endless counting  so your longing is not for this much or that much  your longing is for everything  if you want everything  you must understand that you cannot do that physically  it can only happen in a dimension beyond physical because physicality exists only because of defined boundaries  but there is something within you  which doesn t like this boundary  which wants to stretch the boundary  stretch the boundary  stretch the boundary  you are looking for boundlessness  but you are not courageous enough or conscious enough to admit this  you want to go in installments  no  what you are looking is for boundlessness  if you want boundlessness  it can never ever happen through physical means  so once it doesn t happen through physical means  now you use the most corrupted word called spiritual  spiritual does not mean looking up or looking down  going here  going there  it simply means your experience of life transcended the limitations of being just physical  because everything that s physical about you is an acquired quantity  isn t it  this is just a piece of this planet  what is up here is just a heap of impressions that you have gathered  so what you have acquired can be yours  can never be you  so this longing to have more money  more property  more pleasure  more something is not about those things  you are trying to find that dimension beyond physical nature  but because of constipation  it s not happening     i m going to take the liberty  sadhguru  to do what i normally do on my television show  which is a rapid fire round   mhmm     the  normally the end of this round   see  i ve  when i was young  i watched a lot of  you know  wild west movies   when you fire  i also fire  all right    no  but i promise you  this is not that kind of you are not in my line of fire  at all  i will not take the liberty of being that person   these are just quick questions  which when i ask for one word  you have to stick to that because sometimes you have a tendency of not exactly answering the question asked   but you give such a profound and prolific retort back that it makes you very satiated  but in this case  my only request is that if it s one word  then it s just one word    okay   and the end of this normally  you get a hamper   but in the absence of a hamper here  you already have  a cow     something right  yes  so   and  or this beautiful bouquet that is right next to you  but so there is no hamper but you do will get my utmost gratitude   thank you   all right  very simply  what is the one thing that is essential to living a balanced life   sense    what is the one thing we must absolutely do away with in order to lead a balanced life   senselessness    all right  i thought that was coming  first thing that comes to your mind when i say the following   the first thing  organized religion   madness   marriage   cohabitation    competition   stupid   money   useful   love   can i say a sentence    yes  i will allow that    most beautiful but unfortunately crippling for most people   if i can little elaborate that see  if something unpleasant cripples you  something nasty cripples you  tch  it s acceptable  when something beautiful cripples you  it s a true disaster     if you could ask one person alive or dead  one question  who would you ask and what would that be    i really sorted out all my questions because i did not spend time educating myself or doing anything  i spent my entire life sorting out every damn question i had  i kind of run out of questions    and you certainly have not run out of any answers  and you never will  best advice you have ever received   nothing   never   no  i never sought  nor did i receive  i made myself in such a way  i m incapable either of seeking advice or giving advice    in an imaginary  completely hypothetical situation  if you had a day off with no commitments  no responsibilities  what would you spend the day doing   oh  there re lot of things  this can't be one word    no  it s not one word   see  i have an indiscriminate sense of passion towards everything  there were lots and lots of things i did at one time but these days  time is not allowing me to do that  so generally if i have little time  all i do is play golf because that s safe and within the city and i can get back in time for something else to be done  but if an entire day is left to me   which they have not done for a long time   they ve not left it to me   if that happens  i will close my eyes and sit because that is my  the best  the best  i am at my best when i truly have nothing to do    what is one thing you d like people to remember about you at the end of your life   they must live so wonderfully that they don t even remember me    if you found a way to travel through time  where would you go   i m kind of done with all those things    you re universe visited already  you have visas for every part  of this ecosystem   if we can do some slow fire   yeah    because that s a question with many ramifications  this  for example  traveling in the world  we ve jetted around and now we want to travel to the mars  we want to travel to another place  and now that s not enough  we want to travel into the past and future  all this longing is again exploratory in nature  whether you go on vacation to maldives or you want to go to mars  it is fundamentally exploratory  maybe you re also thinking of relaxation and pleasure and whatever  but essentially it s exploratory  otherwise why can t you do it here  it s something that you want to do  you want to touch another place  this longing is there in the human being only as long as the life that you are remains in a seed form  that is  it did not sprout and blossom  this happened  when adiyogi was expounding the science of yoga and talking about the nature of the cosmos  how it s related to your individual self and what you can do with it  then the seven sages who were with him  they asked   what is the nature of this cosmos  how big is it  where does it begin  where does it end  so he laughed and said   your entire cosmos  i can pack it into a mustard seed  because your ideas of time and space are essentially because you re living within the framework of your intellect  if you cross that dimension  then there is no such thing as time and space  everything is here and now  so  traveling through time  space   no  it means nothing to me because  it s difficult to express  difficult to articulate  if i sound little i have a reputation of being very logical but if i sound illogical or silly to you  you can blame it on my jetlag  i ve just come from united states after six weeks  so you can say   maybe he was jetlagged  that s why sadhguru s saying something silly  but i m fine  i m saying this because you can't fit the universe into your silly little logic  today s human being is too overly enamored with their own logic  that they re missing the entire life  the gamut of phenomena that s happening in the existence is missed because the only way you can accept anything is it has to fit into the square hole of your logic  anything that doesn t fit into your logic  you will reject  in this  you ve rejected the entire cosmos  in this  you ve rejected the magic of life  you have become a slave of logic and completely missing the magic of life  so  this time  space  all this stuff is because intellectually you re trying to dissect the universe and try to understand this  this  this  tell me  if you sit here  suppose you re very joyful  do you see  you will not know how the day passed off  and if you re depressed  do you see the day won t pass  so time is a consequence of the miserable nature of human existence  if you were truly blissed out and ecstatic  you wouldn t know what is a day  what is a year  what is a lifetime  you wouldn t know  there ve been times  i sat down  i didn t realize  i thought it s five minutes but people gathered around and started molesting my feet   no  because they  in their understanding i sat there for many days or whatever  this idea of time and space is a very convoluted idea  simply because people are stuck in the framework of their logic  my work  my fundamental work is to take people beyond the framework of logic into the true magic of existence  our own existence  but it takes a lot of time  still my reputation is of being very logically correct because i m still trying to woo them  tch   still wooing them  you know   for the real thing to happen  they will take a long time unfortunately because they have become such slaves of their logic   what is the first thing you notice when you meet a person   just everything   everything   everything  past  present and future     is it more important to do what you love or love what you re doing   one word or more    the choice is entirely yours   see  if you are an intelligent person  you will try to do what you love most  but if you re a genius  you will do just what is needed    if you could be invisible for a day  what would you do    you wouldn t know    with due respect  what is your biggest weakness   hmm  biggest    what is your biggest weakness   see  what normally people treat as weakness in their lives  okay  let me give a normal answer  why  why am i going into all this  already you said i m  what  what is the word  sashayed   hmm   my biggest weakness is i love danger  without danger  i cannot live  i need to do something  which  which keeps me on the edge of being mortal  being alive and dead  i want to walk that line all the time  every day i m stepping on it one way or the other   is it a weakness  i don t think so  but people think   sadhguru  you shouldn t risk your life like this  but if there s no risk  i m feel  i feel i m not being  because most of the time in my life  for whatever i m doing  i don t feel tested  it s only in moments of danger that i feel little tested  so my weakness is  i like to be stretched  you know  for all the time when i was riding across india and later on i started driving  my only wish was that  to find a machine  which will test my skills  always found the damn things broke down if i took it to my limits  these days recently  i m beginning to get to do a few machines  which are testing me  whether i can push it all the way or not   maybe that s because of my age    no   if i had met them much younger  i think i would have  you would have managed to work around them   one thing the world doesn t know about you   they don t know a thing about me   that s a fact    and the one thing you wish you could change about yourself   oh  i never looked at that   i could speak hindi   no  i m sorry  marathi    the one thing you wish you could change about the world   tch  oh  a lot of things   one   human beings    desperately in need of   sir  what would you consider to be your greatest achievement   i don t think there s any because i always fall woefully short of my own expectation of what i could do   so  i never feel anything is an achievement    is there a song you love and can listen to all the time   oh   i somehow    no   probably because this came to me at a certain time when i was in my early teens maybe  so this one song kind of comes back to me more often than anything else  it s not that i even seek it but somehow  one way or the other  this song keeps coming back to me  is  how many times      okay  okay  i know you haven t seen any of my films but do you have a favorite film   oh  i ve seen many good movies  at one time  i saw a lot of them  i ve not seen much of indian cinema but i saw a lot of  you know  english cinema  but one movie that i thoroughly  thoroughly enjoyed at that time because on that day the way things happened  many life situations fell together and everything  was roman holiday   oh   well  i have to say that that s the first film i ve ever seen in my life  my mother took me to the cinema    here we are   it is true  roman holiday is the first film i ever saw  it was my introduction to the big screen   i m glad i have something in common with you    that image of audrey and gregory peck is  somehow just stayed with me    wonderful   it was probably my age    yeah  it must have been  something you enjoy doing and wish you had more time for   i wish i had more time because i made myself like this  that there is nothing that i enjoy or do not enjoy  i make sure i enjoy everything that i do  including simply sitting quietly  or talking to somebody  or doing whatever  because my activity is not limited to one area  so many things  if you did not enjoy everything that you do and do not do  you will go insane trying to manage so many things  but i ll not go insane because i enjoy being alive  activity is  anything is okay  everything i do  i enjoy   small things  big things  every kind of thing  most profound things and silly things  i enjoy thoroughly     as should us all  lastly  in a biopic made on you  who would play you    but who would make a biopic  first of all    no  there would be lots of interested people   maybe you should animate    i don t think you would want that   well  that is the end of the rapid fire and you totally deserve the hamper that doesn t exist on this platform   but it s a virtual hamper that i ve given to you with my  love  gratitude and deepest amount of respect  thank you     thank you   i think before we open questions to the house  it s integral for me to share that the last week that i spent reading about you and hearing everything that you had to say   so many people question you  including juhi   who s in the house   it s been exhilarating  it s been enlightening and more than anything else  i think it gave me a certain sense of understanding about where i am  being at a crossroad of my life emotionally and also now as a newfound parent  i read some of what you had to say about even parenting  to me  it was extremely enlightening to read that  that not to nurture the dos and don ts so strongly on your child  we all have theories of parenting but i think just what i imbibe from what you had to say is that if i am strong willed and i exude a certain amount of pleasantness and i give out the right amount of energies  my child and my children will emulate that  imbibe that and i don t have to constantly force feed that knowledge on them  they will imbibe it from my energy source in any case  that is what i drew with  am i right   no    okay   see  one level right  but it s not question of energy and don t  don t make simple aspects of life mystical because my entire life is dedicated to make mystical very approachable  but generally in the society  people are trying to make simple aspects of life mystical  rearing a child is not a mystical dimension of life  it s millions of people have done it  for thousands of generations  people have done it  we are not reinventing anything here  it s just a simple biological process  every creature does it  a bird is teaching its offspring to  you know  find a worm and a worm is teaching its offspring to escape the bird  all kinds of things are happening in their own way  similarly human beings are doing it  but as we get more educated  we become more fussy about it  there was a time that a whole lot of parents had eight ten children  they did not even know their names  number one  number two  they called them   but they grew up somehow   they just provided the basic ecosystem and they just grew up  so let s not make it too whatever because you can easily because today is a time of just one child or two children and we ve become totally  overly emotional about what is ours and we lose perspective of what is the reality  a child will grow up anyway  if they re nourished  they will grow up  now what should they grow up as  should they grow up confused  should they grow up strong  should they grow up stable  should they become sage like  should they become something else  that s a question  what they should become in the world is a social issue  that will be decided in the times in which they grow up and the exposure that they have  now you become a filmmaker not because you re intrinsically a filmmaker  because you are in mumbai  you come from that kind of family and the atmosphere around you is like that  naturally you choose that  suppose you were somewhere else  let s say 1000 years ago you were somewhere else  would you be thinking of filmmaking  no  you would be thinking of something else  so what we do in our lives is just a circumstantial thing  let s not read too much into it  the question is  when we have children  how complete and joyful and wonderful are they  because every life is aspiring not to do this or that  every life is aspiring only to become a full fledged life  that s all  whether it s a worm  insect  or plant  or tree  they re only aspiring to become a full fledged life  there is no other aspiration in life  including ourselves  only problem with the human being is  we know what is a full fledged worm  we know what is a full fledged mango tree  but we don t know what is a full fledged human being  this is the only problem  my work is just this  to make people perceive  not understand   you must understand the difference or the distinction between perceiving  experiencing and understanding   not understand  but perceive and experience what it means to be a full fledged life human being  and that s all that must happen to your children and every other children every other child on the planet  what should happen  they must become full fledged life  that s all  for this  they need an ecosystem and nourishment  not teaching from another time  because you belong to an another time  you are past  you may not like it  i am not saying as a director  you are past  i am saying   in terms of time  compared to your children  you are past  okay  so one important thing that we need to do when we have children is  no to help them not to get overly identified with us  this is to make an investment   heavy investment child means   but not expect any return  tch  tch  tch  this is difficult for a stock market world  how to make an investment without return  but this is what bringing up a child means  you want to make a heavy investment  no return expected  this is all  if you want to because i have  you know  in raising my girl   i won t go into the lengthy affair   but i made sure nobody teaches her anything nor did i teach her anything  no one two three  no a b c  no  mary had a little lamb  because i don t care whether mary had a lamb or not   you know  people said   sadhguru  the way you are bringing up this girl  she won t know how many fingers she has  i said   i don t care whether she knows how many fingers she has as long as she knows how to use her fingers     why should she know this is ten  she thinks this is hundred  actually this used to happen  when she was just because i just exposed her to nature  as much as possible  i expose if there is nothing else  at least i took her up on the terrace and showed her the stars  which you can t do in mumbai  you will show other kinds of stars in mumbai   so  she would look up at the sky and say   she would call be by name  first name and say    jaggi  ten  ten stars  tch  because in her mind  the biggest number is ten  somewhere she heard ten   so she didn t say million  she said ten  i said   yes  ten  what is the problem  whether ten stars or ten billion stars  what is your problem  you think you are very knowledgeable because you know there are hundred billion galaxies  in what way does it matter whether there are hundred billion or there are none  what way does it matter  because you are not seeing stars  you are only seeing the reflection in your mind  isn t it  if you spend time to know the nature of what makes you experience all this so  she asked me once something  so i just told her just this   this is all you need to know about life  never look up to anybody  she looked at me like this  i said   not even me  because the value of me will be completely lost the day you look up to me  you must look at me just as i am  then you will see immense value for who i am  if you look up to me  you will miss everything and one day you want to hang me on your wall  as you did to everybody else  to rama  krishna  buddha  shiva  everybody  you hung them on your wall  you will hang me also on your wall  you will miss the entire value  you missed all those guys  now you ll miss me also  you must look at me just the way i am  never look up to anybody  never look down on anybody  this is all   once you do not look up to anything or look down on anything  you will see everything just the way it is  if you see everything just the way it is  you will navigate your life through life effortlessly   that s true  that is simple theory and easy enough to live by   thank you  thank you sadhguru  with that  i think i would like to open the questions up to the house and i am sure we have a volley of questions  which i can already see  hands going up in the air  i don t even know where to start  okay  yeah   i ve worked hard for this  please   sorry   i ve worked hard for this  please   you ve worked hard for this  okay  then i suppose hard work should never go unfounded   hello   is there a mike that is circulating    okay  you can shout it   yeah  if you have worked hard  you can scream loud   yeah  there you go   namaste sadhguru and hi karan johar  i am thirty one  i have kept myself single all my life  so that i could accomplish  no  no  you should go back there  it s  it doesn t come to me  the sound   yeah  my name is rishabh  i am thirty one  i ve kept myself single all my life  so i could accomplish  something big  and you of all people should know how important and difficult it is  important because to accomplish something big  if you re single  it helps without added responsibilities on your shoulders  and difficult because  i know you are trying to speak from your heart but microphone works best here     i just didn t want to be too loud  okay  and difficult because  india  they keep asking you why you are still single  i would like to space dive and i have talked to a million people about this and i have knocked on a hundred doors  to turned down every single time including the doors of isro    i can t hear a thing   including the doors of isro and they said they don t have enough funds   it s a very long question and we have not heard most of it   i can t hear a thing actually  i am feeling incap  yeah   what is your question  sir   okay  so my question is i would like to space dive  you would like to space   space dive  so it s basically going all the way up to space  you want to go to space   okay   and diving from there   okay   and tie what in space   dive   it s space dive   oh  space dive   yes   oh  you want to space dive   yes   okay   so the thing is i have knocked on a hundred doors only to be turned down every single time because even isro turned me down saying they don t have enough funds  space dive is important because india has gone leaps and bounds forward in space technology  but in the human space psychology it s way back  my question to you sadhguru is my biggest weakness is i like to live in danger  my question to you sadhguru is  where do i find an organization that will help me with the discipline  yoga and meditation that ll help me with this   isha foundation   and where do i find a person  most preferably a music  movie director  they ll fund this project  understand the importance of it   hey  you   understand the importance of this project  that india needs a human space program  fund it and make a movie out of it  which has less drama  less songs and more of how a person struggles to get the mission accomplished  thank you very much   okay  we got the question  you took a long time to get to the question but  he wants to space dive  he wants me to make a movie  he want to      no  no  no  he wants money    he wants money  my dearest thirty one year old   that s all i heard  that you were thirty one   if i had money  the last thing i would do is give it to you to space dive   there s many things that i would do with that money and yours is not on my bucket list  but would you like to answer his space diving   the day after tomorrow  that s on fifth   day after tomorrow is  is the sixth   i m sorry  tomorrow  tomorrow evening tomorrow evening i am at the isro at sriharikota for the launch   let me see if i can attach you to the rocket    thank you  yes  will you pass your mike on  sir   no  no  no    the boy is very serious   yeah he is very serious about this   i don't know  would you  so about you being single   you are sa you have saved one life   and i want to tell you  whether you space dive  or you don t dive  or you nosedive   all of us are born single and we die single  tch  in between  what drama is  you do is up to you  so you want to do a single act  or a double act  or a multiple act  it s up to you   but essentially  we are born single and we die single  and if you want to space dive this is comic book stuff  it means nothing  do not waste your life  you are a young man  don t waste your life thinking   i want to space dive  i want to do this and karan is going to fund it  he made is very clear  he has other ideas for his money and i am glad    well  you get married  that s like space diving   it s the same thing  you don t know where you are going  you are just diving   yes   that s true   namaskaram   namaskaram   when i told my teenage daughter about this program  her immediate reaction was an excited wow  she is here with me and this program is everything we thought it would be  question for you  karan   what exactly inspired you to do this session with sadhguru   whoa   thank you ma am   he did not say he is inspired    i was  and the lady definitely has it right  it is because as i said somewhere that there are many questions that i constantly seek answers for  i find myself in a dilemma between my emotions  between my fears  my anxieties  my tussle internally between my letting go of religion and holding on to what i understand of spirituality  i haven t been able to seek too many answers through the books i have read or the people i have heard  to me  sadhguru has been a revelation in more ways than one because he made many of my answers the answers that i was looking for resonate with my life  and i think eventually  what we look for is deep resonance  and anything that you attach yourself to  be  a spiritual energy  a god perhaps  a religion  you feel that you need to find answers within that resonance  and i felt that my life resonated with everything that you said and everything that you professed and that s why i was very interested and excited to be part of this platform   yes sir  i m sorry  i was meant to go to you first  behind you  he s  sir  i ll come back to you sir  the mike  thank you  namaskaram sadhguru  hello karan   hi   there are two questions  if the first one is answered  i don t need the second one s answer  this is a request   can i please get a hug from you  sadhguru    hey  why don t you try him     why am i a second in that line    i didn t name the person   what is your second question  the first is you want a hug  second is what  you can t don t go into a kiss then because  that might be detrimental   no  just the presence of sadhguru for the first time in my life  i just don t want to miss it  i don't know when will i will get the chance next  so if i could just  i know it s a difficult one   no  no  nothing difficult about it  it is just that i have been working with people to make them understand people  especially outside the country and now unfortunately it s caught up here   where is my hug  sadhguru  can i get my hug  tch  you are turning something beautiful into something very ugly  when you are in a certain state of inclusiveness  if it became necessary  you embrace somebody  it s a very beautiful act  now it s a commodity   where is my hug  it s something  that you give and take  it s not a transaction  this is what religion has done   everybody hugs three times  or four times  or whatever number of times  this is not what it is  all the  the tenderness that a human being feels within himself or herself  you re destroying it and make it into some kind of act  okay  i will hug you  i ll hug every one of you  what about it  sweat exchange   so  this is something we need to do  and people also in india  this happens  they grab my hand and   sadhguru bless me  and they place it on their own head   my blessing will not come like this  blessing will come when you become receptive  when you are in a certain way  if it s blessed  something wonderful can happen out of it  something tremendous can happen out of it  you grab my hand and    what is that blessing  and if you grab my hand or foot or you hug me forcefully  this is called molestation    all right  you got your jadu ki jhappi   we had  yes sir  yeah   hello  namaskar sadhguru  i know a hug is not possible but you cook very good dosa  is that possible    certainly not here    i know  no  my question is that when we cook  if we have to get joy   
joy of cooking  then that joy is something which is internal and i cook for my joy  but when you are cooking for others  then you want to give them joy and at times there is a conflict  who should win   this is for him    no sir   no  no  it s for you only   i have different things on my menu    see  let us not make everything this is the most fundamental thing about being spiritual or spiritual process means just this  you  essentially  spiritual process means just this  that you live here like only you exist  nobody else but you  because you see everybody as yourself and there is no issue  people ask me   sadhguru  wherever you go  whether it s 10000 people or 100000 people  how do you speak   ah  well i am talking to them like i ve  if at i if i had the habit   i don t have   if i had the habit of talking in front of my mirror  how i would speak to myself  that s how i am speaking  there is no you  you  what i am doing is not some kind of oratory or discourse  i am just talking like i would talk to myself because i don t see anybody but myself  so  spiritual process means just this  that in some way you became all inclusive  in your experience you became all inclusive  so  one thing that has disappeared from your life is comparison and competition  comparison starts and then it transforms itself into competition and then it goes into ugly things  so even for something as alive and as beautiful as joy joy is  joy is the most important aspect of your life  you know  that is  joy means your experience of you being  your existence is fantastic  your experience of your existence has become beautiful  that s why you re joyful  now  i am not joyful because i make   i make the best dosas  not you  okay    not because i make the best dosas  nor will i be super joyful because i eat whatever the best things that you cook  before i come into your restaurant  i ll be very joyful  if you make something good  i will eat joyfully  if you make something bad very joyfully i will push it aside  but with your good cooking or bad cooking  you can t steal my joy  nor can you give my joy  i want you also and everybody in the world become like this  that somebody else cannot determine what happens within you   because  yes ma am    you are you are calling fundamental sense of slavery that you get into with beautiful names  this is dangerous  so anyway  people are saying wonderful things about your cooking  they have not said anything about you  but they have said wonderful things about your cooking  i would like to eat one day   i don t know if i can afford it but   yes ma am  we ll get a mike for you ma am   namaste sadhguruji  my name is devika patel and i d like to ask you a question because you re a mystic and even otherwise  please don t say   i don t care  because many people out here i m sure do  my question is  what do you think of reincarnation  do you believe in it and if so  can you elaborate on the subject and let us know what you were in your last birth  thank you   now you ve already put strictures on me  as to what i should not say  for me  last three lifetimes have been same work  around the same place and a few people  handful of people  same people  to such an extent that sometimes by mistake i end up calling them by old names  but you should not believe all this nonsense   no  because the moment you believe it  you will look at this person and little if they are friendly with you   oh  maybe in my last life   my past life  it is very good you don t remember a thing about anything because in your present life  you are not able to handle the emotional tangles and psychological involvements with people  if you remember ten lifetimes  you would break your mind  it takes an extraordinary sense of dispassion to download many lifetimes of memory and still not respond or react to those things and simply see it for what it is  in your present state  if such things happen  it ll be a disaster  but anyway you should not believe these things because you should not believe anything or anybody  you should not disbelieve them either  now  in such a large crowd i have a huge reputation of being very logically correct and now you re making me say such stupid things  i m staking my reputation  you must understand that i wouldn t make that mistake  because i don t gain anything by talking about this  because you insisted that i should not dismiss it but essentially  what you re asking is   let me translate this question for you  essentially what you re asking is   when you say   is there a past life or is there a future life  what you re asking is   beyond this body  is there something more  this is all you re asking   after my death or before my birth  was there something else  this is the question  or you are asking   what is the nature of my existence  well  that s my full time business  to bring you to that experience as to what is the nature of your existence  you must come  you should not ask just a casual question here in mumbai and disappear  now you made me say illogical things in front of all these people  now you must invest some time to know what is the nature of your existence  otherwise it s entertainment question    i don t know  you have a color you like   i don t know who to ask   he is working hard but after him  i am afraid of hard working    yes  yes  yes  hard working in blue    can i have mike or can i speak like this   no  no  no we ll get you a mike  we have just two questions after this gentlemen   yeah  yeah  i am going to get there  right there   namaskaram sadhguru  namaskaram karan sir   please somebody give a mike to that lady who is up there with her hand up  after this boy is over  yeah   yeah  yeah   pranam sadhguru  my name is aishwarya nigam and i have been to the ashram many times and i have read many of your books   you must quickly come to the question  everybody is waiting   the question is  sadhguru  i m stuck here i want you please guide me  tell me in a child s language what is the answer and what is the solution  i don t want to give importance to my own thoughts and emotions  tell me how  please make me understand   i don t know when will i get this mike again although i m always in your presence  but i want the answer sadhguru  i don t want to      when you get out of this hall  start walking south   if it s a genuine question  if it s a question which truly matters  you must seek  i would have gone to the ends of the world  if i found somebody  who could answer the billion questions i had  if really it matters to you  the question  you must seek  if you think going south is the answer  if you don t think so  you shouldn t bother with me  if you think so  you shouldn t waste a moment of your life because i want everybody to at least be straight and in some basic integrity to your life  you ask big questions and you leave it and go sit in the matinee show  tch  i m not saying you should not go to the matinee  i m sorry   i m saying the wrong things  wrong examples    that s fine  no offense taken    so  i want you to understand people  somebody came and ask me recently   sadhguru  are you a devotee of shiva  i said  you fool  did you ever see me sitting somewhere and doing shiva pooja  did you see me  my entire bloody life  i have invested in you  all right  there is nothing else i do  except constantly seeing how to raise people to the next step  and you are asking me  am i devoted to somebody  i m bloody devoted to you and you are not seeing it     so  when you ask this question  i take the question seriously  i believe you re genuine  but then you go and get drunk today evening  i am not against any of those things  matinee or drink or this or that  all i am saying is you must have some integrity to your life  when you ask a big question  you must make the investment  isn t it  of time and energy  you must invest life because to bloody answer this  i ve invested my entire life   yes    sadhguru  you had pointed out  there was yes  to the lady right at the back   that lady  please    i have a question   one moment sir  we re just going to the lady and then we ll get where  who is that person   here  right   she still doesn t have the microphone  he is on  on it   okay  you re on the mike  all right go ahead   namaskaram sadhguruji  my question is  what can be the greatest change one can bring to our life to make it more blissful in this birth   you got to change   you have to   you got to change  i said    you got to change   there s nothing else   you think by doing something else  this  will become blissful  no  this one  has to change to become blissful   yes  the lady  has she got the mike  yes  just reaching you ma am   namaskar to one and all  sir  my question is  i get very attached easily and now i feel i m very attached to my responsibilities  so how do i break this bondage and if i really want to do something for myself  not for anybody  just to feel the joy that i ve been listening to you  if i want to really  really feel that joy  how do you i break the bondage of responsibilities and move ahead and how do i overcome my attachments   oh   i want you to understand that responsibility is never a bondage  responsibility means you chose to respond to something wholeheartedly  so it is never a bondage  and how is it opposing your joy  i don t understand  because to what extent you have the ability to respond  only to that extent you know life  if you lose your ability to respond  you become dead  in fact  somebody is dead means they ve lost all ability to respond  that s all it is  so  don t ever think your responsibility is stopping you from being joyful  if you had no responsibilities   many of you would be freaked to madness  you are fortunate you got something to dabble with  nothing to do  i ll keep you in a room  nothing to do  i ll feed you well  you ll go crazy  you must be glad there are distractions for your madness  so  you must understand this  if  if your experience of life is such that if you sit here  you start enjoying your existence   not your thought  not your emotion  not your action  your existence if you start enjoying   you have a certain joy and blissfulness about your very existence  then all this jargon doesn t work  if that one thing has not happened to you  you are in a desperate condition  you have to do a million things to know a little bit of pleasantness  but tell me sincerely  genuinely  in a twenty four hour segment  how many moments of actual joy do you know  most people can count on their fingers  many people have nothing to count  they will say  oh  the day i got married  i was so happy  the day i got my job  i was so happy  it happened  it s history  because it is externally instigated  otherwise by yourself you will become a wreck  please change this  then all these jargons and philosophies are irrelevant to you because you know the joy of your existence   thank you   we have one last question  yes sir   hmm  haa  haa  i m just going from this gentleman  i ll come to you  maybe two yes  sadhguru  i ll leave that to sadhguru  after this how many more he d like to answer   but yes   sadhguruji namaskaram  karanji namaskaram   namaskaram   i m mohit saldana  i ve come from karnal just to see you live and i m feeling blissfully blessed  i didn t come with the question but now i have a question  sadhguruji  you just made a mention that world does not know anything about you  and that remains a fact  even then  any so body world who comes in little contact with you gets so much benefitted  so when would you reveal  or my question is  what does it take to become a arjuna for the yogi of highest order of our times  our krishna  the you to reveal   sorry if that question is still invalid   this is this is difficult to articulate without sounding all wrong because see  everybody is working or everybody is trying to live their life with different frames that they have created for themselves  you can call this mindsets  you can call this framework  you can call this family  you can call this society  you can call this ethics  morals  ideologies  whatever  these are all frameworks you created  but you understand  a frame means you are putting a self imposed limitation upon yourself  i can understand  he being a director producer  he s thinking of frames  because he s thinking of capturing something for doing something else  i m asking you a simple question  do you want to capture this life  or do you want to experience this life  hello   experience   you want to experience this life   you re here to experience this life  and no other reason  everything else is secondary  when i say life  when i use the word life  most of you will think  oh  my work  family  my home  my car  my dog  that s not life  these are all accessories to life  you added all these accessories  believing that with these accessories  your life will get enhanced  but your money  your wealth  your family  your relationships  these are all just accessories  isn t it  the real thing is here   never experienced  so  to first make somebody i m  you know  there re many wonderful people around me  this is the biggest wealth i have  i have some truly  absolutely fabulous people around me all the time  they won t let me pass through a single day without tears of joy  love  ecstasy  without witnessing this  a single day won t pass for me  no matter which part of the world i am in  i don t think there s better wealth in the world  in the physical world  in the human societies  than that  that constantly you re surrounded by people  who are shedding tears of love and ecstasy  having said that  their experience might have become beautiful by being in a certain presence  by realizing a few things  but still  they still have frameworks because very few individuals have the sense of a total sense of abandon to be here without framework  as long as you re with the framework  we can add one drop here  one drop there  one more drop means it ll break  so in my life  if  by the time i fall dead  if i can share maybe one or two percentages of what i have known  i think i m very fortunate  because i m still looking  i ve not given up on it  there can always be one or two individuals who ll come up  we have been working on them  preparing them  so that somebody can exist here without any sense of frames  without any sense of what will be lost  there are many people around me  who  you know  in every action that they do   they re not saying it verbally   in every action that they do  they show that they re willing to die for me  i keep reminding them in a thousand ways  dying for me is not the answer  that you are willing to allow this life  to happen in full flow  this is where the answer is  because only if you re a full fledged life  can i share what s happening within me  otherwise  i m talking about extending your frames  giving you a different frame which is more difficult to manipulate   but totally undoing the frames will need this  that you are a full fledged life  when i say a full fledged life  right now you have invested too much in your thought  too much in your emotion  you look up to something  you look down on something  you like something  you dislike something  in this state  it cannot be done  i am working on people  o lots of them  and i m also scanning the world because there could be s  anybody somewhere  because that will be a blessing  not to me  but to the world  if  if there can be human beings  not one  if there can be a thousand human beings on this planet  or if can be 10000 human beings  or a million human beings  who are just life  no bull  just life  because this is the only thing that you re aspiring for  you may think you want money  you may think you want pleasure  you may think you want something   no  you are only wanting to  having a larger slice of life somehow  isn t it  that s all there is  because that is all there is  you think money will get that  education will get that  love will get that  pleasure will get that  but essentially you want a larger slice of life  so if you want in slices  we will cut it and serve it because we have to keep you going  otherwise you ll run away   but i want to see you  a day when i can throw life at you just like that  without making slices out of it  that would be a great day  make it happen   because i want to change i want to change the perception of what is street  if you say street  if you use the word street  people will think booze  people will think drugs  people will think prostitution  all the ugly things  if we do the right things  in the next twenty  twenty five years  we can change this  that street means beauty  street means love  street means meditativeness  street means spiritual process  street means the highest things  we can do this  if we are willing  we have the tools  we have the means  why i m saying this is  never before many great beings have come  but nobody had the means that we have today  a krishna came  a gentle being   when he spoke  only one man heard  yes  and another man overheard   when adiyogi shiva came  only seven people heard  today we have the ability  we can sit here and speak to every human being on the planet  never before this was possible  now we have such an ability to communicate  if we do not communicate the right things  we are committing a crime against humanity  so when we have this kind of power to communicate  whatever is the highest dimension of life should become street  i my essential work is this  to bring down spirituality from mountaintops to street   that s why my language is little street    not at all  with that  i m sorry we won t be able to take any more questions  we ve reached the end of this conversation with the mystic and thank you sadhguru  thank you for your words  your wisdom  and everything that you always bring  to the energy table of our universe  thank you so much  it s truly been an honor  thank you  and thank you to all of you for being a wonderful audience  thank you
