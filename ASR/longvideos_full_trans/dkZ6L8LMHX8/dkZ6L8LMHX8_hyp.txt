morning so i  do things i have never been in my life  and novice and  i still haven he never to get over the former the latterston very operational at this moment it's  i don't know what to see because i feel i ve lived with you in this last week  done all my research walyostrulis  you have do your homewookwut  homeless  i have done a i better a fereamouterviowork i bought everyone from onaboncaretotoistolandconesitionwithyoubaov to a subduearnubgosamegaswellahahi do  or in your mystical power because you managed to achieve that a and and i think that is not a anything lesewhinecyewhen done with you  a tremendous work a sabgloso the licitacions on that ashuementand a than anything else  i saw the av that all of us saw but all these temonologies associated with you which  from you know the monkenamoticycle  or rocstassiitsolenety and i saw that happen  onamoteiyouflyng  a helicopter  so there are so many dansanashad  bropstarspiritaleni  and i want to create my own one and say you re like almost the santa toavsusplulity  because you bring the anityswthatyimeof life  and i think have riytdtoucd so many millions of people across the world  a blessed to be your presence at this moment and i can wait to be in conversation which is an e to set but i  stop by saying that this is jrulianona  thank you i mean as a filmmaker  human being  as a member of a humanitarian community ah my head is always buzzing with so many questions and i think we bought lit down to a some spirtion inquiries  litusoncsum  always been a debate about these two dumb religion and then spittrali of the people who feel like  ligusimspirtullandi'm  so they know the meaning of that up  is it because sometimes terms are just on around to those people who had the crossroad between religion in spirituality what is your answer to tabelama so we must understand this it is in the very nature of human intalliice that if you do not know something if you realize you nano something because most people do not realize that they demarmolsisyu relied that you do not  i nature for your intelligence to seek to know he doesn't need the  doesanetecoptur do need somebody to introduce that to it  the nature of your intelligence that you wish to know the lots of experiments to show  mice if you leave them in a place within two minutes devilesadeveriting in the pace put

does not concern or so i  yes we are concerned about serrviveldilapoint but once that stick in here of we cannot rest we wonder no more and lessliymore the morrelrealizedonono more bhelongingtonot so this longing to know when it finds a very intense expression in the form of seeking we put this put a tuprosss or in other words the basis of spirituality is a realization that i do not know but the moment you say i m religious you refferguyosoesobelieven when you say or a melive what you are saying is everything that i do not know i will make it up how i may  whose help i seek to make it up may be wedding from a person to person somebody makes it up because of its forliulissus with gotiralassisten somebody makes it up to the assistance of a place to a pindtitottagooowhatever but you seek some a policy you kind of make a compromise in your life that instead of truth you setldforanatolity as the hot pirachilrosusmeanstotisthenlyatorityforyou so ive never litrultfor you so hes a to

pilittiproces does not demand belief because belief and pirlitueprocesscannot go together ilitgiprocessisarconstantinquirey  it is a way of sharpening your questions so that the big people and deeper not into something else but into yourself the  all of your existence because the nature of human existence is such that in our expedient only thing that you can experience is yourself you actually believe you re experiencing many things but you only know everything the way it happens within you  my aneotherwi you  you see these people it looks like that  but actually you know them or you see them only the way they predicted in the firmament of a man there is no way there is no other way for you to experience this life  the weight happens with in new no olecilroses  onsttantn effort to see that the way that it happens within me  tisstortidlihion my meicaminlerdis not a wanhumiter is a plainmeta  it shows me things that  we things are doesn't disstortinittingbeca my part  of my emotion

just the way this this is blattalprocess no well thank you because that s always been a continued that  i believe that the word spirituality is sometimes misused where the otagrev understanding of what i ve  as you said that the i don't know is has immense power and i think accnolegingthe i do knows of your life really means every  and i wish people who a sucdoing that be  according to me sometimes tusolnis the biggest disease that plagues humanity a way of your own self older there all kinds of idiots on the plane  yeah we well it many of them but we must understand this in the very nature of who we are it decide like this  do something stupid today  i yourintellientionbotheryouwhytididothist the nature of human intelligence but the moment you stupidityesythesoldtithendosatgordinost you can go on doing the sea me to a dicting with enormous confidence it gives you confidence without gladite confidence without flalitesatdisastrousprocess if you do not have clarity  you must have his epic  yes that s ridwinolybutegotyotypoebauc well i have to say that you know i was a  i want to pestalizesalittlebuti was  prraeaboutthirtyminsable and my father was verprtickeephi and at that juncture of my life and before that religion was organized in my life i was  i talked to me it was what  that the right thing to do was am when he was in his last stage the were things suggested to me  which were to me now completely ridiculous into in going to a certain temple and feeding a cow of a certain color and a you know and doing a certain ritual at all and all those things that one did without even thinking because as you said when you spoke about the its ondersplanet i was definitely one of those in that state of my life but sometimes you reach a critical stage  seek any kind of desperate measure  try to kind of hold on to any hope  even something that is advocated to that who was against your green of intelligence or thought to those people what is your advice who have reached the end of their robena in on and holding on to anything  relitiousits  so open an unfounded esoladvice so for all is set  emintlevases of these kind of aspeliions or actions  because people are just should scar of life why is it so its a   suppose you sat on a bicycle on stand and to simply be lengforfunbut  came off the stamandsacarling and it fast the fear very fast teter the fundamental reason is  someone who knows how to ride a bicycle fastertatgosthebetterthiis but for someone who does not know how to ride a bicycle the moment it moves tell will happen so the fundamental thing is just this  have been given a very complex and sophisticated way  passed them the process of this life which is mkennisthat  you mind emotionenitymanydio i do is  live this human mechanism is a very complex phenomena now you are going at it you are trying to walk to life without understanding a thing about the real thittuliasing  amitmosttatisstooif  don't move you want to die of boredom if it most yortelevise there is no out of it  mean one thing tell me one thing that human beings so not softeling if the tormessaffordpoverty that recomlrichdthesuffertaxes theyre not educated the hulforfther to send them to school endless sufing they re not made this half of ta  he married  and as i was eating to that next  i say thingvertoansocfehatthat the thatitdisofeinstidutionasso tell me one thing that they re most sufening so now somebody i never looks of philosophy  is suffering and on the arfilas of his liggs now its not about  because you ve not even touched life yet all that you re dabbling with is like now you re on cortonamotonanditsgoingcresy so you are on a basical that you dont know how gerit but this is not just a simple to will bysiclitsec missing  dont know how to ride you know how to manage your car  manager emotion all this thing human experience is essentially happening from within new we the itsamisity of joy a benherhaecstasies happening room within you a case what happens from within  must happen your way isn't it the world will not happen your way the problem is what happens within it is not happening in your way what s happening in your mind is a dream even your dream is not happening your way as the problem the pro  not that your life is not happening your way even you  leave is not happening your way and  the source of their misery but the i married  in children that thing  spowerdtinnall and  only it is just that you are not happening the way you want yourself to be that's all your miseries so even if you want to londowriteapbicycle it is a simple basic my chin in usain level of attention and involvement  one wrightabycsycleticks enormous amount of intent to want rage  it's quite impossible to ride a by  do you know how good it id you can let your hands off  nwulyourthisetings but like more s like  a turning with going nowhere  so  i would like to make a stapinusbiggaus  manebediltheyrwortinsomewheeritmartiage  would like to find a rare but  but on another forum  will you speak about suffering ah  go it is definitely something that i believe  a pity sometimes is like a a a luxury spa you know it  we were all comfortlies it is i believe the most indulgent emotion and gets you nowhere but makes you feel really good for us aibuidoftang  what is your take on something like self pity how is being pity full elecually a  understand that it be you know it  you get great solace in that emotion for that harforoshorpouerantame felbuttyanlethemost happy place to be at like self indulgences so there are many ways to a to peace happinence well being this happen sankorenbila in is he was a little abuse huswen werbellyoussif so he would rant to his wife but she was always besful never be active on doing the middle of his raging rant he stopped and he asked whatever i say how much ever i abuse you you re beaful how do you know this she said i clean the poet of what cleaning the toilet how does it make your best  sisadiusyoutobrush  so one for an gomeahadheva  ah you giving lots of people ideas  so that's not a and thats not a elesentoit  even story  can i do the sandsolisintilthaadifferentwaysams  which is  i had to drop on  to find your solutions because the most exciting line that i read was that  that you know life and that you can scratch you it gone harm you you know you create your own energy in your own life  ho'llgointhisonifverseylbeenbroughtintothis word and its a yorkcontroldwhattoudowithit life has nothing against you or tuchchieven  to do is it is ulteviledonacioyofy he pleasantness that you care within yourself which to me was the a moving line with us  it it very it simplified a very extensive and expansive feeling of anxiety fear in  turbolansthatthumanitywostrounadiliviuses to me three piles of our existence are pretty much you know family fortune and  to which is what i believe it is out of god prolition everything else what we do a at families of  that a few things that have always in treat me and i seek answers or rather validation from a higher eniting such as yourself  it s like i ve always questioned why there s an organic distance no father and son why there is always that angst in that relationship and im so there are many in this house at that havixpeediencethatemotionin their own homes  the one environment we do think the origin of that distance came he could every denorition makes the same mystic  they not letting at all  when we say family in on in until  and crime crime a  a alwiyslefotosthefamily family  so you know we its a kind of cry it is a most basic institution in the making of a society  it does not mean you must remambisix because this is a byloticlidented that we have wvioliiesalrealityicon it obviously this was in some way at least to such an extent our beans give this to us  one part of it that is  to do the way  the wave looks is essentially because of them  i was given to them with somebody else that s another point but it was given by them so its a mylortiblienity this limiting oneself to one violegteglidetiy to be on an and got life time  is a is a crime casiccleares soul many thanks in disscountry this country has suffered a lot from a long time this  you release the mabatettewidhdoo and tidondkohebottithis family problem it is that a threstedtosindro is to soflyng my  is best no other what even today of seffeing the same thing  and his best and he should become ticking a what it's not a  man is very went so family is a basic identity that we are born with it's a wonderful thing when you are a child without the framilsupport you wouldn t be who you are to a him many rice  ill do this bike and the good and great respect for the family because huomanclyateredthisboninser  that as soon as you for loud of your mothers  not ready to get a ponyorfeet undothings like other pictures it needs a a long desticionviteot before a man becomes a man or a woman becomes a woman there is a long fitdedwithve the incibition of family is most important and  i did no question about that but  supposed to grow beyond that identity but a whole lot of people just never grow beyond that did  the folowichothesaffa and sometimes if there bonnincerdenplaces they make the ndigonationsofa you are supposed to grow out of that as a child is most white that yoadidentiviedwith the family  another  to roll the and you of violity because violitesthemostbasicientity has to grow beyond that so having said that is it necessary that every father that every son has to have some kind of thanks it is not about father and son it is just old men being accommodated in the same home any will at ten your father was godlike so this problem started after you became  sixteen when you want to be a man and is not in a space this big man is actemyingdometpice and that man thinks this is  space and was this the konrectonightetodthehasfatherandsonbecause now that i  it is no father then son  two men in the same house  is not in a space this happens not just in human family every creature when it's an elephant or a buffalo whatever  erdycrietov's life this happens that he be some fiction  that the under one goes out or the older one goes up this happens evlerav because this is not a problem between pafatherlamsonetis  to men trying to share the same space and the same woman called mother to one and wife to the other to me but that certainly breaks of a strong miss  dicountryeis operated with because the problem was always meant to be two women in the same house and you  dantedonhisheadwhich i believe its true because i  poblemlies the fact that two men gonbyunomedolia with men women in a different way and  the women have a way of covering the aflictions in said  if they do it in a certain way in a have a lantwayma but in more  a head on  headwuttingisaman'sway as a is difrentsewellod friendly but the victionhabpis and i feel it s always like the you know the mother energy of the house that  and has to be the brunt of disducaldlinafaminy  its also the other thing that  sort of that thought is that i believe very strongly that the people you love the most you kind of tend to dump all your anxieties your angers your your sirszourinsecure is all on to the that one sauce it is a maximum love and the one that you love the most  that we as a human race tend to do that then to  all our negative emotions on our most positive light source not only be if you try to do i on someone on the street mashdrapyea so  i do dosingerahasiflese is that always fair first to fall  it s not fair for you to carry anxieties and hangs and angers and problems with the new because see i rotoftilio you have some difference against me is that he would fightmeowlhewaslenawe to something you have some difference but if you start oteingyourself this is the most helpless creature right not must  unless mtelinnoueven an anbonechild if you pokeliketh he lesson  and himself in is all litlway  but this one is completely different when you at poking yourself it is  a completely different less life  the worst kind of torture  last level of mind is one who tortures himself but they always think  highest level  i suffer for everybody you  offered anyway of a a a a  that is everybody you wilddumeiton them other  simply severe  people come to me and say  i cant there with my my mother in law is impose my husband after all her son  we osisferofor me my boss is not even human like this said weve i  you come to a boy i love you nice place to stay i ll give you good food nothing to do will you live in the ticket of you  thing is i will make some random checks on you when i check you must be joyful if you re miserable i dont believe in feeding misery it so i can  so you leave them in one place with twenty for hours you will see how they will mess themselves up so when a alone if you  miserable you are obviously in bad company a a a  now you re thinking because of this person and selling  that was a aamsuffingjest long by yourself without an enteventment thoutdixtingwith

because they re fallen in love with the world not  if this terllontheylgocreatthat'safact what is i mean sorry to break that pleanofsourt  the the solution to that kind of feeling  of just not enjoying your own space because we have not looked at how human means on works it is like you have a super sofhistigeethemasschin this is the supersipencomputer out of this the of my same which lipedsobercompurtors is'terught i must in have you read the us as many  it is then dideoticsystemisjustthis this is not a philosophy this is  idulitti  the religion does not  teaching this is just the uses man   how your body should sit hoidmussbreathehow the  should we hold them so  and it should be what  things you can do with it how should you keep it so that this will  and at its highest possible level see the set on a companies have been doing somebodysarth o as a  and only seven here our only the epreshent of the people no  is seven percent of the people are using only seven percent of the selfonscipblit we had not even talking about it the smart for  talkabothedomfos to ninety seven percent of the people are using only seven percent of a mongaddet if that is the fact how much do you believe are people making use of this tremendous cabect chest on the series because they never bothered to be the uses manual you you tell them this  said who can i do as the youniusesmanu eusaliteledoyo you have to spend some time with this this was little by the social core  not by me a you isn't it you must learn to leave  problem is eliplas see suppose you are you do not you have not learnt to habit well a landing it have but lets ateyetomitabe you look at it is a eganistansestul you don't know that for what it doesn't make it doesn't mean a thing to you could you do not know the alphabet now this is the problem that in to the society modern in  we have not even brought fundamental  towards how to read this book because we ve never did this  accidentvilmanagingit if you manage by accident sometimes it works  and i do it work  moment you have  moment  will a moment you peaceful  in that one i was sir you know i would go the long story sharp  endelobi and somebody came and it of miss   i said podathetle he said this is the highsscrayofgreeing i said that s your opinion but what does it mean so no no this is really the highest way of it  i said don right but what is the word me he said it means peace and i say is peace the highest way of greeting unless your bonindmeddeast in south india  come up to me in the morning and i a peace i wrlastwordwrong with you i  if you deprive yourself of something for a long time than leap becomes godlike if you not even fortemdis even if god appeared for a prayer food of course so  should deprive yourself of fundamental  saying fundamental things because to be peaceful and joyful is not the ultimate all of life if you want to enjoy a me you must be peaceful and joyful if you  to enjoy your friend you must be peaceful and joyful if you want to enjoy your walk on the street you must be peaceful enjoy  if you want to enjoy simple things that you do in the  if you must be at least peaceful and joyful if not exteptic so it is a most fundamental requirement this is not happening people are saying this is a demidaballof life and so as for the to leaders are saying he is the ultimate ball of life such people i onlylesinpieace what i believe a surransussal is opening i think that seems to be domonodety than comes out of you know mental health solutions  sebjrindthatsems to be rampant in in many parts of the

philosophy but all your teachings are definitely about finding you  and seeking that pleasantness from within but to thoswhoite not strong enough to acive that and seek this assistance what you take on that  let me cellectounmoltinginthe question this is this is not a teaching this is jtotachnoledgean  giving some people simple methods with which they can work you people are coming for a teaching they re sited with me bicuslivelytamethecomeotelevemorecontusedthineverbefoe is the look if their moranfulse in a way my job is done because myentiledworkistogivethem out of siliconcluions  that they

urdnatgodadiyoubetterhaveaetiflit othewiseyerhedwinplack now thats all thats happening the the disnal support system that we had taking it off when we talked about religion with all you re back we

goodmendolamermywyouogetlaughteryouknow unfortunately because you dont know when somebody  and when somebody s being stupid you can vickup this is the biggest problem but those families who have somebody in the family was mentally disturbed you don't know when the making it up when they really suffering you  up so  pefictrlthe in all signs anyway to tell you exactly when because human beings can make up every kind of thing an actor you know i dont know you will actor i do most things i hook  i would be actigelinavituthe existence or a out  i got a yuachaddistutid  i i tried i failed  so a a go to madacor  a  i aacurmantheleforte if you make up the tleofolactyes so you know in a cinema or a drama you can act something and  really real itoopoint we are thistantoulanddeoplemilsifdonexperience like a tree so when a mentally any person is in your home dont know whether he s acting it up or it s real sometimes it s real  as i playing with it you  i am  now when to be compassionate when to be hard on him this is the biggest problem for people who have mentally people in within their homes this is the huge problem because there is not perficwy of making a judgment  it is not joke  humensanathes of vitivfledarltink the lion between sanity and insanity sulthin if you push it every day you would cross it see when you get angry what do you say what s the explacon and magritte or a man regnow so you are enjoying that little bit of madness you crossed the line and it felt like some kind of a freedom and power but one day when you cannot cross back  that is when suffering bigans and seffelingmenns it's not like physical pain it's immesoely be a on people who we mentally  trying to help them it is nobody  have it but unfo it leads becoming an epidemic in the world thatmentdtalinessusofgrowinglikenever before because all the supports they had we are pulling it up without replacing  if people become so conscious and so capable within them  you pull all the supports everything will be fine but without giving that competence you just bulisuppors pepbericlack in the western societies it s happening large skin we im not going to be far behind  islievansocietes in india will move in this direction was once again in  i was unlenindias more west an rest the more people indanensierthen in a man well no thank you  because i know it is definitely a crisis that  use some as i said see i  some who help  i am happy for them and im so grateful for a sauceothearreilvill  find a pleasantness within themselves  a truly is a glorisolutiontothet  i said plesentness human bleszonness can be looked at in many different way one simple we are looking because medical sciences looking at it that way  see it that way  to consequence for me  every human experience has a camittalebasestert what you call as pesjolouonmildtanquilityadthanyecstasy  i think has a chemical balance of chemical rises to it even held a ilhev has a chemical rises to it to the  ntadfhormaquoligyis just about  manegyouheldwerelyousingchemicals so to do other adoctosjawbataphyiciance job ease oh its a arcisseofcamissy that he singamanuge but this pill something more happened that i  something less happened then do this do that  to manage the artist of chemistry because this is the most complex chemical factory on the planet right  of very complex chemical fact managing it from outside is so headiviteddifficult but you could manage it from inside but you must have access fuulentypes if you are in an are not eilileto  then how do you manage it from inside  i say to manage from outside all even mental illness is a largely being managed by chemical input but all the chemicals that you can think of on this planet or in some way moderdypresent in this whether you are seeking medically prisclamdrag ardios going for the backstreet drugs what are you going as sensily youre trying to bring pleasantness within yourself right because health means one level of pleasantness if if body becomes pleasant we call this health if it becomes very pleasant lycalledispleasure if your mind becomes pleasant we call this peace if it becomes very pleasant we call this joy if you re emotions become pleasant you call this love if it becomes very pleasant lycallitconpasson if your very energies become pleasant lycodicablic if it becomes very pleasant we call it extos if you surrounding to become pleasant we call this success  so we are trying to manage pleasantness by putting chemicals to what extent means oh tistotsticsaout now in united states  a sevendiwiscent of the population  some can of prescription medication he had must have rlinedgundtry but its an enormous choice of noticement last dies here seventy percent are on the sclatefrescritionmedicatin so you re time to manage your sanity and your hell by putting chemicals from outside but there is no doubt in anybody s mind today that this is the good

this wiblishofaaah somebody elsilivexyou because they see some value to a ontnit but i lestcrickmysevlf what is this  the this is a its one for the big in the west and people say i love myself  to respect to low  the word the using is there must be two you can love some  somebody can love you you respect somebody somebody can respect  but i love my self idepuick myself this temminomities the spemenolhedeoftheinsane but it s becoming popular  a number of growing a a a  by the hour  and one said by the arm  line the sum of a  a ate  a heitherdaytookyweget that be we in  and teliveerte is there is that a ceiling to extremity to  tremymotion like love when you love something is  a time that you have to stop is there any such thing as stopping the extent of your extreme emotion i see that about even the negative emotions of when you love someone how do really stop the extent of it i would say with the wonderfallisamtothescarfulyfricose you will imiditeytreet a goodsaidthis if the danggaiswegrordy  love love strong if you hate it  whatever the hell do live strong so important otherwise you ll live an insiedlife not  in a thing about anything and i i i gave the oeprinciple he said and it in your life it doesn't matter what i etellinpeoplethereandnotglasingithe in because too much this sir you know a floerypeachingsshavegoneintopeople they re not looking at what works and what doesnt  they want something pretty i am not interested in what pretty  whether it works or not is the only thing madlwatworksisweryfandasticritso even if it s anger notinessarly love or compassion  if it is anger just on it for twenty four hours anybody amtiing just jy this were yourself  before i would stay intensely angry let me  believe me at the end of twenty four hours or well before that a beenlike but you will see you are not capable of being angry because to stay intensely  need an armutenage it burnchof try one  tentivfoteiurstayanenuar  i thatlookanmanigforthetdist of

simply a all the time all the not about anybody or anything simply just like that it works wonderfully  it works much better and quicker in love or lytingis with the kind of lattice with  that the kind of emotion within you you can t live in social it must you will have to redroglmountaincave and simply be angry about  thing just like that if you want to live in social atmosphuus you need to be in a pleasant to of emotion  wstulitbiduconstantmets so should i stop myself somewhere what you re asking  so i be constipated about my love  at least in low not some sense of abandon that there is no brakes on it i would say on everything in your life in your car you must pull out all the pedals  role should be there yes in your life that he beportlytrodi because brake will happen when you die is not for you to brake every day he is not for you to be  you like me we core somewhere that's natures business your business is to be full on because life ienitcesapot that this ipleefficent did you ever see death happening in efishently i do whether we did happen it was a perfect at icitefeo  never happen in efficiently but life happens inefficiently life lipesconstantsuport but he does not you need support stopping something is death in a way so to love you  to laughulolee i or ofraid to every  nothing is done with abandon everything with constipation  to do something with abandon because if you do not know at least how to scream in abandon there is no way you will ever know how commeditate rispirlatil  put it to elepeesastate of total abandon complete state of a bar i indoors  and i when we try and live by that but what happens when a positive emotion reaches its extreme stage and ventures into a dark area love can also transfer itself into obsession see  you are referingdo it s like this support you don't have legs and if i say come dance i had no i cannot even walk without my crutch so i cannot walk without my crutch or i cannot live without you is not different this  the deingdordestedyftltheamengring but it is a fact i cannot walk without a crutch or i cannot live without you is the same thing because you re misunderstanding you a dependent and he set in relationship that you hold with somebody as love let's sir look at this thing of what is lap hes a certain losming within you now who are you in your life who are you using as the manure   this flower is fregmant  because somebody sprayed perfume to the roots it is fragrant because somebody put filth to the roots so  so now you found a little flower within you of laugh who is your man  who is your filth this is a dangersstertidyformeglenta  but this is exactly what we are doing not the question is just this whatever is the most pleasant emotion within you  kepewil of bringing it on by yourself all of are you in a delapiated condition of the see that you are a pushedtotmishine that somebody has to push you otherwise you cannot be your joy your love your peace your ecstasy must be your making is it right so now your love will become about sharing your joy not squeezing joy out of somebody right now most pepesjod mostpepusideaofforloverfar  so more like a mitarwenofischeme it is all give that you got a live out me i cant live without you the i  that the other person also becomes in lalevon can t live without me   is a very a very huge problem in the human societies love is not happening as a loving it is something that we are trying to suck out of somebody love is not about somebody i wanted to not is  maybe because you re a filempersonalitthymaybe you said you are not an actor but there are many actors who are loved by people people are in dulingwithextasy simply looking up the but the problem is they ve never seen them they only seen that play of light and sound they never seen them but the lover what i m saying is you keep  well of loving somebody that busonmonotexistev be animated  but you still love and you experiencing all the fruits of love i m saying love is something that you do within yourself let me on somebody you can loedbyyourself  a long time in this country it s been there then he in me avisehamtogorandanothersthe  you you dont have to love and to be in an extreme state of love  you need anybody  simply do it by yourself and not just in emotion even pisielatsthissis happened to them simply because they are in a great love affair with someone who is not even here all right so it is something that you do within yourself  now you in love with somebody here that somebody may not even know that you love but you can experience this as a  you dont need the support from the other person this is an experience that s happening within you love is within you if you  it is not a bit sitting with he s not sitting you are capable of a i give emotions if you want you can make it very sweet  so if you re in a very sweet state of emotion people say oh he s very loving you may not be loving in the real context of how they understand but you are in a pleasant state of emoshans  are you to pleasant things so people think you love them  make love an island not a country not no make love the nerves not an either right now when you say i love you this particular person you only and i look at these people i look at them like this  one bothanath islanloeapofice it is to discliminatesry this one face in this ten thousand faces i love rest depressing looking at them this is the island laugh i know you are in an island city  its time to it  so it s it s time that you understand love are happening within you may somebody s timeliatedthis you re gretfutothethat  ignited this within you but law of a is yoursspisinit and in not expediencethats happening to you some  is providing the stimulus we have ratedfuohetattheireprovidingthis but they are not causing it it s been caused from within  and once you understand this why would you be walking on the street lovingly why would you look at a tree lovingly why would you look at a buffalo lovingly why would do to e the cloud lovingly because it is not something that i did  should i control it why with a good  this not at a danger it doesnt get away  a almost everything that you experience the more you exercise it the more edstaevilabletoyouwa it s your love or joy or a or anger the wall you exercised the moristavalibletwo because it's aftralyouaremaking it can tirdlyomyk so when it you re making why don't you enjoyed every moment of your  somebody s they re nobody s  and what is a problem  but the princito i think of the  the mother of of videos that legs a large part of humanity is expectation i have a simple terlyithat i tried to expect less to a  so let me disappointed less  and i feel to cortearyourlexpectationas possibly the topesthing to do because we constantly expect from relationships from the work we do  ruydaiotielronger about this expectition i have the highest expectation of every human being on the planet and i know and i know they will disappoint me i will die disappointed but joyfully disappointed a asoitfldisaboointabeetisatlasteatserthatyouebincede  but that is not a the place to know on almostelasite he these things are not like that to be joyful or miserable is essentially your choice it s a choice that you're making within yourself may be it an unconscious choice anything that you do in costly like now unconsciously my hand can fly but what i can do unconsciously  i do the same thing definitely consciously also isn t it this is the fundamental difference between being human and every other creature we are not doing anything if and from what dedoing the same things reddoidlytlemoreconsciously  a lead a different of a altogether  things at the these we leave  produseveliprousedtei the  thing is we are doing it little more consciously and then leave looked like another world by itself  tinkwiareabowdthowonl because we can do the same silly little things little more consciously so if i can not my hand and concseusl i cannot a void consciously if i  and become joyful and conscious i can also become joyful consciously if i am joyful because of my choice suppose disappointments are thrown at me i will be joyfully disappointed  and my expectations of people are very very hot i have an impossible epecision so i am not ill die joyfully blissfully disappointed  because i know the native of the world where the  i am not somebody who lives in fancy la la land  so abundant love and no godtildonexpectiseshp oh i love is not a quantity it s a pole  it is not that if you will set in amount of things you are loving is not sthingyoucan  our eyes closed not look at anybody and still be loving because a sensalybleasantnessofpordemostion how blissant im using i had any need to god be plesentnessowiththennew now i am super pleasant but if a child came i m glad im and put him on my lap if an odol'dtcomesyodondothata  this okay a dog came i disdol this but another comes another person comes you don t do this to them i say  expression will change from person to person of relitionshipthelagtionship what kind of intimacy and what kind of closeness you have with people but does it mean to say that you should not  this with as much low as you at somebody or is somebody should you not should you not do nomegoa with as much as low as you have your child  i am asking because there is no see this i m and trying to demolish the word abundance because when  abundance the is also scarcity it is not sitting  neither a ondantmosca if you are willing it's on  are not willing it off the talk  a simple then  fundamentally that is always a need i met the so many things even when in your process yprofesionlprocessahoveryougoneawelor income and and keep going heres a need to constantly get more you know that what you have there's no satisfaction and a place to stop is that an end to need no no they should on it is just that now that you asking this question in  where you have realized that at every point of the  you thought this is it if this one thing happens and from filled but the vitenexderyou realize this is not it this one motinginonemolting  you know that after ten years still the same state lontcentinso means you are ready for you  this means you have a distorod that you re longing is not for more your longing is for all you  in to expand is not just for more it is that a on another word  your longing is in some way for infinite expansion if you hamiyourdinfinlatexpanssion unconsciously and if it finds a very basic physical expression we called the sexueli what you re trying to do is something that is not you with physical contact you are trying to make it a part of yourself you know doesn't work if you try emotionally we call this love emotionally you trying to intmove something which is not you as a part of yourself this is your lower fat if you do it mentally this gets labeled as greed  is in conquest or here is simply shopping  if your good consciously then we call the you  you go in union you re longing to expand in finightly but because of little constipation in the head you are going in in stomments can you boiinstolemensandbecomeinfinelinteammas is a possible can  one two three four and one day say infinity no you will only become endless coming so your longing is not for this much or that  your longing is for every if you want everything you must understand that you cannot do that physically it when only happened in the diamonsen beyond physical because physicality exists only because of defined but but there is something within new which doesn't like this  which wants to stretch the  state the bat states the bondaom you are looking for boundlessness but you are not cellaginincolitjis enough for conscious enough to admit  you want to borninstolments now what you re looking is for boundlessness if you want boundlessness it can never ever happen to physical means so one it doesn't happen to a physical now you use the most connected word arldsspiitul to the jewel does not mean looking up looking down  he s going there it simply means your experience of life transcended the limitations of being just physical because everything that s physical about you is an acquired qolity want isn't  this is just a piece of this land what is a puriosasjustte heap of impressions of you gather so what you have acquired can be or  can never be you so this longing to have more in more  the more  more something is not about those things you are trying to find a dimension beyond physical nature but because of constipation is not happening and on a take the liberty is that go to do  i only do on my television show  of which is a a a rapid fire round  a  but only the in it  when i was young i watched laefayouknow while rest always serrivhe when you

to your individual self and what you can do with it then the seven sages who were with him they asked what is the nature of this cosmos biggest  i began reef  so he laughed and said you  cosmos i can pack it id you must tocceed because your ideas of time and space and essentially because living within the framework of your intellect if you cross the bang then there is no such thing as time and space everything is here in a so we do have a little time base no atrencs nothing to me because sdifficultoexpre difficult to artacolykeifi sound little i would a petition of being very logical but if i sound illogical or silly to you you can blame it on my get i just come from a itecttateshavto six weeks  you can say maybe he was gita  so i said he was saying something silly but i m fine i am saying this because you can fit the universe into your silly little logic  to this human being is too warwardly enamored with their own  to the missing the entire life the gamut of phenomena that s happening in the existence is missed because the only way you can axe anything  it has to fit into the square hole of your logic  and the thing that toeonteffitentyourmogecyewillegect in this you resitethentarwassus in this the rejected the magic of life you have become a slave of logic and completely missing the magic of life so this time space all this stuff is because intelictuuly your

sat down i in'trealaslitorticfamin people gathered around and started molesting my feet  well because the the in their understanding i sat there for many days or whatever this idea of time and space is a very convoluted idea simply before people are stuck in the framework of their logic my work my fundamental work is to take people beyond the framework of logic into the true magic of existence our own existence but it takes a lot of time still my apoditionisofbigvealylagicllycolect recauseamsestaltryinwtoodem still wooing ten  but the real thing to happen  the erdigue ongtime unfortunately  as there become such slaves of their logic what is the first thing you notice when you meet a bus just everything everything  as an entry  is it more important to do what you love or love what you doing one word or more  the choice is a aleurs see if you are an intelligent person you will try to do what you love most but if you litginiusteyowillodjust what is needed if you could be invisible for a day what would you do  you would not a a a a  respect what is your biggest weakness  is what  the oinghis weakness see what normally people treat as weakness in their lives okay a mioenormalance  i  all is  you say them what of the word ash  the guess weaknesses i loved danger without danger i cannot live  to do something which keeps me on the edge of being mortal  being alive  i want to walk that line all the time  they are isterpring on it one we the  is it a weakness  one thing so but people think the oushultrisgoirliflike this but if there s no risk a anti i feel a nothing because most of the time in my life or whatever it in i don't feetesitet it s only a moments of danger that i feel that i tested  and wicnesscesi like to be stretched no but all the time when i was the riding across india and ledronisesathedrabe my only misure sir that to find a machine which will test my skills a was fond of them things broke down i it took it to milan  this is an a beginning to get to do a few mess to testing my but that i can pushed all the way more  maybe letertecauseofmyagethattheethe  i had them  a  the out of  so  one thing the world doesn t know about to they do not think about

on  huminbengs desferdlenithough  so what would you consider to be your greatest sacuvement i don't think there s any  as i always fall a fully short of my own expectation of what i could do so i never feel and the thing is an atement is the song you love and inniscent al the day  oh i somehow    probably because this sir came to me at a certain time when i this so in my lictensmetby so this one song kind of comes back to me more often than anything else it s not that i even seek it but somehow other this song keeps coming back to me i  how many times i i  i know you have not seen any of my films  you have a favorite film  i have seen many good always had on  i saw a lot of them  in much of indantinema  but i saw a lot of a i m a andglessinima but one that i totally till you enjoyed

something you enjoy doing and wish you had more time for a resendmotimebecuse i made myself like this that there is nothing that i enjoy or do  no and make sure i enjoy everything that i do  including simply sitting quietly or talking to somebody doing whatever because my activity is not limited to one and a  things if you did not enjoy everything that you do and do not be you will go insane trying to manage so many things but it s not boinsaingbucwause injor being alive actoridis and the thing is  everything i do and  small things a wiakedtingseverthegindof most profound things and celiting i

questions o the house it's a declnformeto share that speak that i spent reading about you and hearing everything that you had to say so many people question you in trutingjui was in the house  its been the exiratingitsbinenlightning and more than anything else  i can give me a cectensense of understanding but where i bring at a crossroad of my life i more  and also how is it as if you found better i read some of what you have to say about even verenty to me it was extremely i lighten to read the that not to not or the dos and don so strongly on your child you know  no we all have theories of bereting but i think just what i invite from what you had to say that if i am strong willed  and i exude a sudden manoplesantness and i give up the right amount ovanities my child and my children will emulate that imbibe that and i don't have to constantly force feed that knowledge on them i envivitformyenurtysauceminigis that is what i drew with am i right now   see you know one level right but it s not question of energy and do don't make semtelaspict of life mister  because my entire life is dedicated to make mystical very aplughable  then the lead of society  tea trying to make simple aspects of life mystical learning a child is not a mystical damien of life  millions of people have done it for thousands of generations people have done it a mattrealenthinganythingthere ustecimplbaleecaldprosseseveyg so is it a bird is tithing it's ofsplingdoyouknowfimd in the world is testing its afseringtooesgapteberg all kinds of things so happening in the only similarly human beings are doing it but as we get more to it  we become more fussy about it there was a time that a whole lot of vedenshadahtentilre they did not even know their name utoenumberwolthecalthem but they grew up somehow  is related the music eqoasistomandtijusgroup so lets not make it too whatever because you can easily because today is a time of just one child at touch  and we become to lady emotional about what is ours and we lose perspective of what is the the  a tidrygroupe anyway the noise the we don now what should they grow up as  a confused should they grow up strong should the gropstee they become sage like  they become something else  us  what they should become in the world in the socialisup datorilly decided by the times in which they grow and the bus that they have now you become a philommakga not because you idn'ttinieofhilemie because it in men by can that and of family in that mustethavaundus like that to lutosthap supoywassomata lets a thousand years i l you are some bad  would you be thinking of vilefmaking you would be thinking something else so watrelooin our lives is just a circumstantial  let's notgrewomuchenoit the qushcinnes when we have children how

saying as the diracgoyopac i m saying in terms of time compared to a children york passed  so one important thing that we need to do when we have children is no  help them not to get a word identified

reaction was an excited wow she is here with me and basitordramaseverthen we thought it would be question for you utter what exactly inspired you to do this session with passupgirlo  ah thank you ma  or save inspite  i was and and the lady differently has a  it is because as i said somewhere that there are many questions that i constantly seek conscersfol find myself in a dilemma a between my motion between my fears my anxieties  cusilinturnlebetween my letting go of religion  holding on to what i understand as viritualitin  i havent been able to seek too many answers to the book i read people ive heard to be subcroo has been a revelation in always than one  because he made many of my answers  the answers that i was looking for a resanitwithmy life and i think eventually what we look for is deep prison  and anything that you would not yourself to be a spiritual and  of god  religion you feel that you need to find answers within that is  so i felt at a my life resonated with everything that you  sadaneveything that you professed and thats why i was very interested and excited to be part of the spetful yes i say i was mentofotooufist  you re on  so act that the mike thank  cossasgoo  a logo  i am the two lessons if the first for the santeledolknewsicaontanswo  as  caneppeasgetahosesomemusagol i wendetrihim why am i a second in that line  i didnt have the person  what is your second question on the  you want to hear the thinking is or you  so don't go to  is then because that i had no  as the present so aueforthfirsttiringmylafeiju on mornimissit  dont know wendemeicaldthetonsnakes so if i could test  i know it s difficult one no no nothing difficult about it it is just that ah i be working with people to make them understand people  especially outside the country  ufortunateyitsocantaper it is my hunshadlittle can i get my ham you are turning something beautiful into something very ugly when you in a certain state of indlsivna if it became necessary you embrace somebody to me if you tifllact  its a comodybereadyo my home it s something that you give  its not a transect  this is what religonestaneve he has to the games are for in of whatever number of time this is not what it is all the tendernesstathehumanbeingfelcswithin himself or herself you disjonmitandmakeitinto some kind of act okay have you i'llageeryeneof you  about it so decent so this is something we i do to and people  and it has happened they grab my  i ll bless me and the blizsadonteronheg  a  blessing will not come like this lssingwillcome when you become receptive  in a setimwa  it s blessed something wonderful can happen or something tremendous andhappenoof  you lab my hand  where is that blessing  and if you go at my hand out a footodyohadmenforcfully this is goldmolustiin all right  a like a satopituppysdwe had gis  yeah  i dont noiscasitoue i know a hug is not possible that i know you cookveygooddosa is that was aceddnly not get or i  i i  see that when we cook if you have to get joy joy of cooking  then that joy is something which is internal and i go go for my  but when you are cooking for others then you want to give them joy and at a are theres a conflict or she  this is for him to  so  a  i have a different things on my menu  let us not make everything this is the most fundamental time of whats being but  arepiletorocessmensjustthis you assensialisworlegeolrusesmentsthist you live here like only you exist nobody else would you  because you see everybody as yourself a theres no is  he be  he said a little better  or the it's a ten thousand people a under thousand people how do you speak oh i am talking to them like i  if it is if i had the habit i dont  if i had the habit of talking invent old my miller how i would speak to myself that's how i m speaking that is no what im doing is not some kind of oricry or this  and is talking like iitokemy  so because i don't see anybody but myself  a spiritual process means just this that in some way you became all inclusive in your expeinedyoubegamolinplussing so one thing that has disappeared from your life is comparison and competition comveriinstorts and then he xenthomsitselfotthecompat and then it goes into ugly things even for something as alive and beautiful as care joy  joy us the most important aspect of your life in  that this joy mens your experience of you being your inxistenies and task  ualdecfuredexpedience of your existence has become beautiful that's why a joyful now i am not joyful because i  i make the best goes not you  not because i make the best is us nor will i be super joyful because i eat what it were the best things that you cook before i come in to a restaurant i had a very to it  if you will make something good i believe joyfully it would make something book good very loyfullyhaverwushitbesidee but with your good cooking or redwinyuconstinte my joy nor can you give my joy  you and so on everybody in the world to become like that somebody else cannot be them in  happens to him  because yes  you are  a fundamental sense of slavery that you get into with the beautiful  this is dangerous so anyway people are saying wonderful things about your cooking they ve not see anything about you but they said wonderful things about your cooking out  relieved one thing  i dont know if i can afford it but  yes  we get a my mom nomissisadguogi y name is deicoverta and id like to ask you a question because you re a mystic and even that the ice as tony i don't get because many bebelowtoi'mshoreddor  qshilesah what you think of three incomnetion you believe in it a if so  can you alabenit on the subject and litdesnknoah what you work in your last word thank you now you olorypuostictesonme after what i should not say for me rasterltylifetames hahavebeen same work around the same place and a few people handful of people same people to cuttanestemp that sometimes by mistake i end up calling them by old mans but you should not believe all this nonsense now the  the moment you believe it you will look at this person and little if that friendly with you oh maybe in my last life  my past life it is very good you don t remember a thing about anything because in your present life you are not able do and the emotonaltangle and psychological involvements with people if you remember ten life so you would break your mind it takes an extraordinary sense of dispassion to download many lifetimes  and still not respond or react to the thing and simply see but what it is in your present state if such things happen it ll be a dosa but anyway you should not believe this tell you should not reading anything on anybody you should not bipeave them either now in or a large  i have a huge reputation of being very logically  and now you re making me say such to it things i m staking my epidtiton you must understand that i wouldn t make that mistake because i don't get anything by talking about this because you insisted that i should not disdismiss it but essentially what you  in a let me translate this question for you essentially would your osies when you say is there a past life what is that i you  what you re asking is beyond this body is there something more the sowlorask after my that ought before my birth was this  thinghelts this is the bushthin are you asking what is the nature of my exist  well thats a my from time business to bring you to that experience as to what is the nature of your existence you must come you should not ask just a casual qushtonhereinwonmlandis  now you made me say locgatcal things in front of all this  now you must unless some time to know what is the nature of your exist nothorwisisendetenwhenqustion i don't know or you have a color you like  oh  i was in hard but i after him in a rate of hard working the  it gets yes a working in  the now we get you my  we have just tooquessons up or the sentron i went i got to get there  no mascottimsotethesombetogivratmygor that lady was of the  a hand up after this boy we or   a  one is a hole in the command  i have been to the u s of any day and i have eaten many of you  as quickly come to the qusntiontaqushio so i m stuck  and i want you to please guide  delmenaxciouslanguagh what is the answer in what is a sorition  i want to give importance to my own porsonin  to me how these made me understand  i don't know when will i get this mike again although i am all visengyurpisencs what  i i want the answer of god  to a  he was this hall start walking so he is a dinner question  it s a question which truly matters you must see i do one and on the world if i found somebody who could answer the billion cuostionstiha i really matters field a question you must see if you think going he is the answer you should not think so used bother with me if you think so you should was a moment of your life because i want everybody to at this is traveten  some basic indigrtytoof life you ask a big wish  and you live and baantetin the magnicha i  houdnotgotothemaneranso  in the on things  exams it has i know vet so i wanted to understand people somebody came in  eisidlysaid glow arouduouty of sea i said you fool did you ever see me sitting somewhere and who so we put a  the use  i am a bloody life i ve been missed in you all right  nothing else i do  constantly seeing how to blaveointeneco and you are asking me i am a gewoudedtosome  anleryyewatittoyouandyou're ng it so when as this  and i think the custonsitiouslabeleveyouinni but then you born dirunglenn i am not against any of those  smatinyordoingputthisathat all ansengtisyou must have some integityveto  when you ask a big  should you must make the enmeshmentrisentipof time and in it  he was in my life because to bloody answer this  i said my anti life yes a sad you had pointed out the bites the laterdtadetelac in the  i should one movansa which  go in to the live and then we get we  waidsheas  entnavemah is on ok   all right so  buy my question is what can be the grades change one can bring to a a life to  it more blissful in this world  you like a change you have you got to take state  but the  is using were doing something else this will become blissful not  and after changes to become less  yes the lady has she got the mike yes just reaching you ma  no masgard to one and on so my question is i get very attached  and now i feel i'mbetyatatcheto my responsciilittis so how do i break this bondage if i really want to do something for my  not for anybody  to feel the joy that i ve been listening to you if i want to realedrulyvfeel that joy how do i bring the bontnageofflison its an hour  and how do i obocomemyajachmens i want yuredtoundestand that resuponsibilitiisneverthebondage ponibilityminsyoucholstorespondto something holeaurtidly she is never a bondage and how is it opposing your joy i don't understand  because to what extent you have the believed to respond only to that extent you know life if you lose your abelitiverius  you become  in fact somebody is dead means they lost allivlititorespontettollitis so not everything you responsibility stopping you from being joyful i who had no is pontedwite many of you would be freaked to madness you are fortunate you got something to dabble  nothing to do i kepounot  think that i do well  great  you must be glad there are distractions for your madness so you must understand this  if your experience of life is such that if sit here you start enjoying your existence not you that not to a  torture action i would existence i you start enjoying you have a certain joy and blissfulness about your very existence then all this dargan doesn't work if that one thing has not happened to you you are in a desperate condition you  to a million things to know a little bit of pleasantness but tell me sin  gene in a twenty four hour segment how many moments of actual joy do you now mospepecancometonthe fingers many people have nothing to come the  d the be i got married never so  the day i got my job i was so happy it happened it is so  because it is externally is to get  otherwise by yourself you would be come over  trecschanesthis all this jargon and philosophies and illelevent  because you know the joy of your existence tancu we have one last question yes  a  i just going from desentmenoncom that maybe to yes  so  i i leave that to a  to do sompotyvoteeplikedoanssovides in a moscattemandanientomuscoutof  a  not just to you  missfodilissed come the or  but now i have a qurstonsudguodity i just made a mention that world does not knoniting about you and that remains a fact even then any so body from the world who comes in little contact or you gets so much benefitted so when would you to be at my  so what does it take to become a do a for the you go hiresotetofhatda it is that that you were  ecittatcorsenissillinredet this is this is difficult to articulate without sounding all wrong because see everybody is working or everybody is trying to live their life with different frames that they have created for themselves you can call this mine said  can call this framework  called his family and  society you can call his etticksmorals iteoligies whatever  ntrameboksyucreatedhim but you understand a frame means you are putting herself imposed limitation upon yourself i can understand he being a direct of roduca he s thinking of frames because he s thinking of captivingsometing or doing something else i am asking you a simple  do you want to capture this life or do you want to experience is life hello  he won t expenenct this lie you will hear to egxspidensthislife and no is  everything else is second  when i say life when i use the word life most of you will think all my work of my family  on my car my dog that s not life  access of this to life you added all this excess of his believing that with these accictothese your life wiggetanhanched but your money your well your family your relationships these are all just accesatesosnint  the real thing is here expedienced so to first make somebody i m you to the many wonderful people around me  the biggest well by  i have some truly absolutely fabulous people around me all the time they won't let me passtrooasingleday without tears of joy love ecstasy without witnessing this a single lay on that  in no matter which part of the world i  i dont think this better we well in the world in the physical world in the human societies than that that constantly you sounded by people  in tears of love and ecstasy having said that the exclidience might have become beautiful by being in a certain presence by realizing a few things but still this to have frimbars because very few individuals have the sense of a total sense of abandon to be here without framework as long as you re with the framework we can and won drop  one draw they re one more dromindidliprek so in my life if by the time i fall in if i can share mevryontontopeciticedisof what i have no i think i m very fortunate because i m still looking and not given up on it the canoisbeonotto individecstwoacome up we have been working on preparing that so that somebody can exist here without any sense of frames without any sense of what will be lost there are many people around me  you know in every action that the  so theyre not saying it we will every action that the  the showedhettheyvwillingtodifforte  i keep reminding them in a  was dying for me is not banissa that you are willing to allow this life to happen in full this is welthencerdhes only if you are a oflitlie can i share what s happening within me otherwise i m talking about extending your frames giving you a different frame which is more difficult to manopelat but torillandowingthe frames will lead this  you are a folflitlife when i say of foflid's life  now you have invested too much in your  to a machine  motion you look up to  thing  something you like some think of is like some in this state it cannot be done i am working on  a lot of them and i m also scanning the world because he could be  anybody some way  because that will be a blessing not to me but to the world if there can be human beings not one if there can be a thousand human beings on this planet or can be ten thousand human beings  milionumandbengs who are just life no  just life because this is the only thing that you re aspiring for oumentting you on money you may think you want  venting you want some i know you are only wanting to having a larger slice of life somehow is it  the tallthetis because that is all that is you think money  that i recently  that loerilgan later  but essentially you want a larger slice of life so you fewantinslices i i cottitanservid because we have to keep you going other you run  but i wonder see a day when i can to life at you just like that without making slices out of it  a great  make it happen i want to change i want to change the perception of what is street if you say  efoelsthewordsle people will think  people will think draw all i think prostitution allouglythings if we do the right things the next wendtydentyfiveyars we can change this that street means beauty see me street means love it means meditative  seetsminsporetuprocess street means the highest things we can do this if we are willing we have the  we have the means in saying this is never before many good means have come but but i had the means that we have to  agresnotgame and gene  and is full only one man heard this  the man her when a deogaysselokame only seven people heard two day we have their  the wean sit here and speak to every human being on the blanet never before this was possible now we have such an ability to comeminicat i feel do not come in a get the right things we are committing a crime against a man  so when we have this kind of power to communicate whatever is the highest dimension of life should become street i my essential work is this to bring dansoporaturlityforommounkaindobslesscleet that s why my language of little street not at all with that sorry we won t be to take any more questions
