in a room well in the  a  i  enjoy here or and i see  that there are many who a no on your work  and there are a a i do you are in educated man and then but i  a of education so  to well  you know a is my  ones for me i i  say i i i  so  a wediscorafjoyalecuriosity  and what is so i have a agrees out of my  as i was here and a morringlymai  i m so i oyaalasoseriousofoojoifulteriaity so in the seeroathawl suritooofjoyaleriosity  together a roshadiios  it are your thoughts on a number of times the one that is near a year to my hero as a net  and as a a i later  this area of a gone and burn  is to a i i i  fifty four are of isities inameriomead criteria  and nurses are in the same  and you re here at all and a were little brains dmeloninforwhole and so to those fifty four person of aszetios  on us pass  he is all too  what would you a what would you say  this we have to bring help peter to rheultsare to others one frendomentaltanus you bring a very profound sense of hole and to you the waiouslanentiene of life that we are  i didnt sink and promchaenywell i said to her that physicians are in a state of burnout how would the cost help could sell more manas and they cannot cause hell if they are in a state of more  now we re seeing as modern medicine progresses comes at withmirica laftermidaca research all and to think but people are not getting el by  people are getting sick than an before a country like a note state which is so the most aflane country in the planet which essentially means you have a choice of nourishments eveihomenbeg as a choice of maieent most of the element that you see in other parts of the world  noishmandrelated and some way because the needednotishment is not that at the right time but a whole lot of people on this planet but in a country where there is a choice of noisement i will turn excessive choice of enovishment a nation is spending tretwelandollars in a car this is bigger than the prugits of made nations in the world in this economisanohandisadumtrytielondollars he was spending that much on help care of a quatamillion people  shows somewhere we have missed help rherenindhustrygoing miss help  well we can explain into any way but doctors being under burner everybody thinks their profession is the altifficultwhil if any individual human being is creating something that they really care for  there would be never any kind of one out myself and a whole lot of people around me we are selendaes of the week twenty or a day to the anesctifivedas the soulskidol you will not see me burned out may be sometimes i ll get physically exhausted  maybe i ll i have exhaustion one day definitely not of burnout or boredom those two things will now a to me why am saingleias the finiminal reason why this is happening is stiglirly the physicians because their waious kinds of professions but particularly when people go to a doctor in some way they re placing their life in his hands somebody s willing to place their life in your hands meamistrececasasaketaduty it s not just a job  states a business it isnt hensomeolieswillingdooplace their life in your hands  telling you even people who live with you your own wife and children or husband is not willing to place of life in your hands comlitly a  but somebody an unknown person comes and places his life in your hands i think its segretdisproviligethatsomebody trussyou at that level that the willing to trust you with life you could orecttingsoronthings nongyfthamongly because nobody has figured the human worry absolutely all right a knowing to some extent so you may do any number of wronpthings but they placed their life into a hands  think traditionally it was said like this in india  in an in society if education medicine an spirtchilprocess  it gets commercialized  society will go down the drain i think we re doing this and time modern world all the and becoming commercialized there s nothing wrong with commerce commerce is a a transaction of give take you go in this ill give you that but there are some things which cannot be handled as just give and take if you bring this aspect of transaction into spiritual process into education and into medicine then it turns ugly and that ugliness will definitely burn or one were to other of all what people are experiencing as burnout is first  or theyre doing something that they don't care for if the  genuinely doing something that they truly care for there would be no but the  opportunity you get to do it the better  be isn'pie  thing is to words as erainend the joy of doing what you re doing is not there in one s life this is not just for any one profession it s for all professions but pardiglatlyinaprfession like this we its a question of life under for somebody else when it s a question of life and death for the person who sitting in plant of you it can be of trancection for you well this is a business end to everything because to make anything sustainable  has to be a business and god we are not against the business end of it but within yourself  so dont do it as a great offering to the person was sitting and tlentofew of course they will pay their fee but within yourself if you are not like this definitely you will burnout doing this kind of work otherwise every day if you help a person if in some way you made somebody life the better the end of the day we should you be belompd into a joyful state i should be in a state of burnout a band of the day it should not be a on  if you generally expedients you have an hence many lives aa  this is not a out surveys  is not a our ideas of ysovethis i did this no there is a joy within a human being when they re able to touch another life why you are holding a few people dear to as family ease because you believe you can touch their life in some way to be  difference that what is most important for human being  in every activity that we perform waanitie of the activity how profoundly we can put somewhere else this is what makes the big difference if you make a movie you don't want to make a more way which nobody wants to watch would you you want people to watch this movie and come to tears isn't it  you know an a billahouse that nobody wants to live in you do want to cook something that nobody wants to eat these things you can do only because  some way you are able to touch another life pro activity this is most fundamental need within the human being and as a physician you have a phenomenon opportunity of touching lives like very other very few other professions can do and this was not live to burn up  this is happening so because leatlaingpocreated like a transaction and the most fundamental thing that we have not understood in this process  that human experience is can caused from within not from outside  your joy and misery open and gleishure you are a banana to see even light and darkness right now is happening only within you it never happens around you what happens of a in  if you try to fix it by fixing what is around you gobombcersinnotime i am surprised why only fifty four percent  because if you don t understand human experience is caused from millin especially medical professionals who in some way have dealt into the nature of human visioli and i believe to some extent the mind we must or that every aspect of human experience comes from gileno and  modern medicine is  unlike the traditional made is entirely camimefixes for everyting so you understand that both held a illness is happening because of cheese joy and misery is a certain chemistry if in taps of cimmistry he s in agony are different tabpsofchimmistry or in other words we are a chemical soup  the question is  are you a great soup or a lousy soup  now if i give soup making an gains to all of you  do you believe all if he may come with the same kind of soup  you may come with hundred different varieties of soups so there is something called as the kind of silk making all of us have come with the same frenlamentalyiandgaledians of life see in how many ways we have become and only fifty four prersentegettingburnurt handling life so wrong  is on should be buntap so lets talk about making soup  so  not on going to the cadianavetywouldcookasi  so this suotolinyouwill  so i know a ten  there is a nurse or a physician he has come and  told a family member that their love and just die or they treated a child who s undergoing hemotheream or they re in a client  where they re taking care of someone who you know it doesn't have in nohinssureancethecorlthetgasionandso a good lose have come home and there s perinsaeruand ah and they love  i i i think burned out is love they do they do a and i want to add a or a b  we do  ah and so we what can i do what is a nurssareziianassistantadinwhat i moringcomesarroundiwavdowmutcshsay  i i can tisue away at making your chemistry joblisfulcheasci that meant you re blissful by your own nature not because of something that happened a and you this exaclywhanamsaing what this question implies what happens to and you determine what happens within you the significance of being human is this that what happens within me i can create a on me of what heaven at an me mix me  still in animal nature  human being means i do all the same things that the animal does but i can do all of it consciously that  but of being human well we are one likaneothecrea you grow you eat usually maybe you lyproduceanyoudiwondy this is what every creature us is what you and me do but we can do it consciously which includes your thought your emotion everything to put this very simply it amazes me that people are twenty thirty fifty sixty years of age this to do not know how to handle the and how to hand let emotion this is a huge to desatoliting the world if you do not how to use your hands wudoucollitofdisaility if you don t know how to manage your thought temanieorteo is it not a disability just because everybody is in the same kind so he does not become normal  so essentially you are you have made a choice of dealing with people who are sick or dying  it is a juice  and it is a privilege that those who unwell being unwelmins you are no more hundred percent on your feet you need somebody help such people and those who are dying in some way they re willing to trust you on put their life and to  to great pilege  in this there are many things to do  you were exam said you have to convey something and lets in for somebody sometimes you are not able to see them  i see this you have no time or they have no money or whatever  is it there i m not qustninglis but the most important aspect of the  if you want to bring well being to somebody you must know how to be well isn't it to lewis how wontutoattarmask how how would you be create well being to someone when you do not know how to be well what this implies is if i have to be well the world has to be perfect well you not going to be well  because even if you re just two people in the family not everything happens the way you think it should happen isn t it   who can tell me to  even if you just to people not everything will ever happen to you hundred percent the way you want it fifty one percent if its happening you  you have the controlling stake anything if you expect you have a does  it  so outtidewenever happen hundred percent the way you want it or in other words if you expect the outside to be hundred percent the way you want it you just not equipped to live here in this water as a  i expecting tags external situations deal and it percent my way obviously i m not equipped to live in this world we are a wolentyeroganization or four thousand full time willing so it to a milandpartanvolantes every day somebody is coming up to me is  do i cant take her in a my contticit this person i can work with this person this man is like this this woman is like that i tell them see this is the kind of people that exist in the world if you what you re doing is at a significant  work with these people  there  you want to work with ideal people you must go to heaven and today  these are our realities if you truly see gene  what i m doing is significant it oh significant if ignliicantenoftomake difference in lives around me now you have to do that work the problem is not of the nature of your work but is to ask anybody from the topmost job down to the most menial job everybody complains about stress so stress is not about your job  tell this  to usable many as a  fast came to united states wherever i went people were talking about stress management i couldn't understand this because in my understanding we manage whatever is precious to us  family or we owe business a money why would anybody want to manage stress  it took me a while to understand people have concluded that stress is a part of their life stress is not a part of your life he suggestiourinabbiity to manage your own to eelonamolshonyouroenitiesandorownbody  no if your mind took instructions from you would you live in stress or in bliss is to  is yes so a simple thing is not happening because your mind is not even digging instructions from you if you are in verliinstans against you who the hancansiru so this anxiety this stress is not about the job it is just that our education systems are such they are telling you how to conquer the world you know how to break an invisible atom how to go beyond space but did not telling you a thing about this one is the most complex the showanderqolitahumanmecanismth the most complex and sofasticatedmacimachanismyouhaveseen yes yes as a doctor you  no but i m asking even the doctors had a day the led the uses manual how to use this nothing just by accident something when you live by accident anxieties natural  so i was really interested in the title of your i  in her egedering but you is guide to joy and those are some words that you don t usually see often so close together i in  engineering i enjoy  so  you  here are a a  and the older  and sonerinyoeyonow  i like that word engineering  and you need to know there are some really  some of the tieeginearsattheuniversyartheiy yesterday was the end  there yes  a world engineers day  so what  as the them  so what would you say is the message of  so inkourgananha inner engineering you ve is gone  well it does that and  see  so if you and me were here let the hundred years ago  at two hundred years sigl  the word was and how it is to  it is almost another world it's not the same  you wouldn t have recognized it that s how much it dischanged what changed this or i believe to engineer extra not situations the way we want  we could sit outside and do this but now we re sitting in this building because this is engineered for our comfort now engineering essentially means making something just a way we want it  everything in the world the way we want it but now fifty four qestendbonot because we did not make this one thing the way we want it  if we made this one thing the way we want it  and the same curschin live blissfully or miserably if you made this the way you want it you would definitely make this misfl  level of pleasantness for yourself what you want for your neighbor may be debatable but what for yourself is very clear esentit so this is not happening because we have never approached in a well being in a scintoficmanner we are thinking something else from somewhere is going to fix this if you want to be well we looked up in india they call it a perwallo aminsetofonabal i m saying is it true that you are living on a round planet hello the  tovounplanetthadweaelivingon and unmtapofhitdids spinning  if you look up you re inrelibly looking up in the wrong direction  and the  you must go to australia to look up the right way  saying we are simply even incapable of knowing what is up and i am in the genius is it some we walk an thiscos must decide up we not only do not know we cannot know res'tit so vidondivannorwhich is up which is down we do not know what is forward what is backward we really do not know what is east what is west for  is we made up things but it is one thing that you can know red  it is a perspective there is inward and there is outward we have been just busy fixing the outside you fix the outside as much as you want all  get is comfort and convenience you will not get well by if weling has to happen you have to engineer you into our de the way you want it  and this it becomes the way you want now this will be joyful if our time becomes the way i want they will become foot  have to admit this now before in the history of humanity any other generation knew the kind of comforts and convenient that you and me i enjoyed right  i sutnl   we  the most comfortable denervition ever i  whining like crazy  so lets take a a the interlign and the owolf  one thing that strikes me as so powerful about so mission in the world is  you seem to a sucatiliroertothofthose  so bro you must take off the word broker so  i say  i sustasilyahpursuedbotofthose werealso  you  is a vaationatyufisisteyunynplanstrees and then you also teach be more a about inner engineering and i think that could be jaungefor  we in the west we in the west perhaps love the  i may at the expense as the inermeral  i love to hear your metal  see all this a massive projects of help education and ecology that we re doing in southern india how  i happened only because of an inner experience the millions of people or had a powerful in the experience it of that were a will to generate this action because these massive projects are all completely done by a waluncerforce while enters means  nobody s trained for the job this is a  a  and you cannot fire them for inefficiency of the wall  at the same time even if their honingakeepos  at any time without notisedicanjustlanes you manage an organization like this you go crazy in no time  as it up i do  having disglab my job it is a sure route to madness  if i was not as well as a list i am within myself it wolavedoenmeboners is our managed businesses before  and at that time i  we met authority and people to get things going  and the main thing was they were on my in a i was doing the payment for them  a man control  now i don't make any pemint for anybody everybody is not paid  is paid in fact they spend it all money and come and do everything to get them going is essensirly the inner engineering because there is a powerful experience within  which drives them to do all this work it is  unfortunate that people always trying to do wide the world you must understand this that the very basic nature of human intellect is this human intellect you know all of you the  it is the better it is sent at all you hold egivitmer so the shaper is the better it is i think intellect  i asslywantotalkaboutbeanomprot  and one with that forelitterandotprojectti so the  because one of the things is a vawiahsir  linefulloftheitteryfe you can manfulloftheintatlife now you talked about being a prophet  antenna so then i  i i i cesourrihav  wtodaerisanaaloro so and in the yroviaholeinheojestythereare there is the role of those who speed trustehow tea against injustice who a sacrifice themselves for a cause because of injustice and there in that herituve there is an and there is rage  there are segnetadhingroszofpemoein  all in our hand  who has a do gostheanabahweral on the rain the  my or  all  one thing about inynineraner robuyinpecewithinoneself  the other side of that one so what is the  a time to be all to that is a march to be in ray at the injustice of the world how would you say i said that in a chat and now you this is not poplofname in a maker tegriaveroseadif you re engrade your one has  so if you are out of rage you on us  i should really out of rage definitely one of us  you think there is a reason for your in which is a wrong perception if you look at it people get terribly angry with a loud ones all on wilancewithinthe homes as they get tetoblly angry with their lodone somebody to delivinwept  have a good reason to get angry because she did not cook the breakfast properly on the dogpedwhereit's not supposed to be i have seen people yelling and screaming and breaking their clubs on a golf course where the having a good time  saying everybody has a reason to be angry anger means just this when your any as a  the you know today that when you re angry lipily you generating poison in the system italy poisoning yourself internally and when you re angry you know you do the most tydortithinks in your life when you turn back and see you can t believe you did it but most yderticthings happen when you're angry so i m asking  i  anger an intelligent expression of human life or a nedeorticexpression of human life hello  i do  to the toloeetoknow  the next time you re angry you just know you re stupid  because you re turning against yourself but i i tell the reason this anger has been eagistd ease in a moment of anger some people who were sleeping all their life propelled themselves into action and that action produced some results yes that can happen it may so happen in all that if i throw a stone at you is of hitting you it hit the appolinetry and the happolfellinyourhans but that we axcolent  denderlyfitrowastol your head we track what is supposed to happen   so i got angry and something got done so i think anger is a great way of doing things so when you re angry you yell and you are somebody  asking all issue how many of you enjoy being yelled at and fumed by somebody else here the i  as a you has your wife  parents said anybody you really petaly enjoy this  of  did you   no  what makes you think somebody else enjoys it  hanerioltheydon't enjoy go and when the done the no so it doesn't matter whether the anger happened to a man that you call as a prophet  because we have a way of ilegizing everything which it which we have a distance of time suddenly anything which is over tousandneaars becomes sacred in most people s mind but whatever is happening right  however gleateties they don't have the intelligence to recognize this people are saying the past things are great simply because everybody else is saying it not because they truly a god miss  we are coming to a time  youldontdoit you are children will do this that is a time is coming in the world  unless it makes sense it doesn't come it  doesn't matter from what should come  even if god comes and speaks here the next generation will rejected unless it makes sense to that  this is a good development because instead of authority being the truth truth is becoming the tor its a good way to go but once this happens questions are going to rise all kinds of qorsgtions with all due respect to avererlydetuditon on the planet i come from a  which has immense teditions and  no most people in the  most indians are not even conscious of how many traditions how many ways are there in a land when my when came to  he said anything that can ever be done either by man or god has been done in this land because the exploration is so incredible but with all of the stick to all of the i said is that if you raise plea fundamental questions ninety percent of the cliptualknowledge and the planet we collapse and so  this is the truth if you ask the put in an questions you would see ninety percent of the scoptual knowledge on the planet will just  apsitdconstantcolto  so what othetherequectionsihavh you not a scripture so why should i onosisaskedrebushesy the fundamental questions if you ask simply you see the fundamental thing is this you re going to where you from you dont know where he recall you can believe  if we work hard in up on your weakend make you believe anything you must know is  is talking to a group of people in national  see when our center  it is telling no a joke  in the joke  is offered to god as him immediately if you leave stood up and said do you wiliogodisama a  i know what i ve gotten into you know i said i was just telling you go  said he doesnt matter you said him now this is a debit in a man is god a man or a woman i think this time in the election the trying to settle that issue  but her where we come from no satici we have a man god we have a woman god if a cow god  lefantovorde  a god  i go they were not  we have every kind crawling  i  flying ones okay  because we are a very wise in he foresaw all the future problems that marries  and they will also die  it sir in the last elexonthetliedtosettlethat did not settle i think people are debating and tuthelunturctes  god black or white it s a big serious debate happening  really debating about  is god white or black well you know in the i mean to londermen if the amminteplarndgordisblak i aglyvwith  that if a white man can have a white man white god  and a black man have a black god but you re not this people do not know because of these parts the world only mass  profit sons others came the donkno in india we know god is brown  i  because god himself visited india nine  so he we are is  god  god visited india nine times himself indians are very proud of this  because god with a titus himself nine times and he s endesonand messenger and others and others to other places i keep reminding them that s because god wandered to do the job hands on with indians  dress anybody else with indians in nine times and he failed  it is to a  no coming to belief i m saying we can make people believe anything if you work upon them from their childhood and i believe me  a work hardeough  make them believe this that everything belief gives you a confidence without clarity can fine with our cladipies of disaster on dhisplanic it is not substitued for clatit there is no substitute for clarity but if you have confidence you can just do something just like  sometimes it works even if you re not clear  simply do something a little work cannottenyouacok a  this happened in new york city  a afternon  dead boy came back from school he a very progressive mother  beuslyssuwas single  and sang the  nobody catch up with her  came home and he asked me  a is garde man or woman he thought about all the gender is shoes and the  election and everything and then she thought about it for a while and his  but the boy end into deep top after a little hole the boy came back  momma is god black or white again she thought about all the vashillissuesinthegonty and after considering this at length she said  the borentendaverydeeptop then after some time he came back and  momma is god straight or gay  she again thought about it and then she said bolt the boy i enjoy  and i got it  microdacon  so how how we arrived at our belief has cultural back every culture has made up their own stuff but i must  do i geneanlynowredwecamefron and here we are going if you re so clear where you re going that is for an appointment with the creator i don't think you should posplondeponmentt  stick it to a is  but thats not true if death is next moment you don't want to go if you are so sure only that fanatic who broldhimselfa seems to be sure  but he else has a doubt isn't it every working intelligence has a doubt no  if you have frolethenyourindeligencewith o riding belief systems then you re going every other working intelligence if death is next man t there is hes addition of not purse isn't  because you really don't know where you re going you can believe what you want  but you really do not know  leaf is of social significance to some extent of psychological significant but existentially means nothing as youre vasinus  in some ways we in many ways we are the in an harrisors of our tanses and then he had an do influence a in shape us  is there a dis wall for the triatishosfromwhenepeco for example  if i go try internesayearmy i even try get some direction and meaning and as i hope and values  i can't you  and there are rigtfrotisies i knew traditions a crishtindreniialns  muslincoditions  so comes  me  uthurponwegeanher myeli  or tea  hrowwyolnerdhehas in erengineraiasoto  is it a s and he said to anchor our lives now that is that is the decision that every human being has to make do you want to be anchored or do you want to set sail that is a decision that everybody has to make if you re looking for confidence if you look in cortailit then you have to anchor yourself to something if you re looking to go far then anchoring will not help  taditions a ted  with all due respect all of them particularly to dishes that are coming from india and ill tranewaave  i m i m not in any way next put on to make a comment can  traditions that you talking about but essentially tradition means this what somebody did estiday is to days caltandtodition what you do today is tomorrow cultandtedition i m asking you how much of what we doing today in this world and in discon is consciously concie but all the rubbish that we do i become tomorrow's conture and tradition of this land isn't it  hello a  i am saying do you believe that people who lived here thousandersil what such huporsilperedhuman being they did everything perfectly and you re doing everything wrong not a devereontoduspeoplelike you we have a way of elodizing ever thing with which we have a certain distance of time  are they of no all you  not true that a whole lot of things  lot of things that  we as human being simplynoberday bites thanks to the traditions in bitrehodonap we can not in all but if you wonder not this life it as myself no tradition is i can inspire you peitiancan put you in a delecti tradition cannot take you there because this has to happen now to you only then it s a living reality for you otherwise you will read in a book and believe it but how do you know this works i am saying it should work people he said  how do we know whether we have met a real teacher on a boodowarnot i just tell them look at his face whether it s worked for him what he s talking  has it worked for him the question if it will tell him it doesn't matter what you must go at him because his work for him if it s not worked for him what is the point dead tradition so one of the traditions here in a man  westerlusall is the traditional of the as so  i  only li may be two or three hundred years old the ranomyseenoltrial coorstedytherolive it's good  that's how i got sures or you know no  troistehotelevieapain so another this persuesoltheevistat  he has  a  only a embrace the life of the spirit and and the truth that we find in our faith raises and i love a true it s a reognicehattentionyewlobe be the truth that we discover in the lab at the truth  to discover a in our  and a i i a  i think that is as a grave oh i said granwayaliinawa  sort of my a joy all or so is both the true that i see around me and a lie rose in my heart i do reonezehentene who is your porseinthad so when my talk about the evidence based approach it is not a tradition when it happened when that anyone happened it was breaking of all taditions till then because it was written in a book because a ceddinatolity was espousing it with a visisit  when medical signs i walk from jenner to others the fundamental thing was they era all tradition so now if that is becoming a tradition i am very sorry because this was an exploration an exploration cannot be traditional an exploration means you re constantly trying to step into new tellana that s what an exploration is but if that has become traditional then we are treading the same track and thinking it s exploration this evidence based approach has done wonders to many many things not quesionsion but this entire process is dependent upon the human intellect a who re just coming to  i went off a little bit  human intellect by nature  i was just asking would you like a charporbloct hello you wnderedchapl if you have a sharp entmantletser you have a knife in your hand what could you know with this flower with a knife  and i finally if you want me to a cut it into pieces thats exactly what the intellect us whatever you give it it will cut it open and tried to see the  of evidence based science is disection fundamentally  well even in the medical school i m sure we  the paolity labs we are opening up fortunately the dead  but if you really want to know somebody someone whom you love very much  who really want to know them  think you should dissect them to know that what it looks like that no obviously so there is one dimension of like which is physical in nature red dysectionwilwolke but what is physical about you body of the two cat is a  comilation that you gathered over a bit of time a food the oveton  ulipiesof the planet most i don't get this when they re walking but the countless number of people who walked on this planet before you and me they are on top site  you and me also will be topsoil unless your friends choose to bury you real deep  fearing that you may rise from the dead this is just the soil is at ip   this is just the soil that you walk upon so this is an ehimently what you gather what you accumulate  a plan it is mine you cannot say it's me isn't it right now i am speaking i said this is my glass you would think or so the gilsems to have a problem but lets listen everybody says his wife after some time i so this is me then you will telletico  as if i claim this is me you know it is it qualifies for madness these  whatever you acquire you can say this is mine but if you say this is me this is madness yes son i had any saecettwish  to this  this qualify   so every day you re doing this food appeared on your plate you said this is my food you ate and then you say to me this is my best but you have enormous company  and we believe in democracy whenever the madority safe must be like so it is going on but the moment you believe something that is not you as yourself you can lost it  you would be a a from life so turning inward does not mean dissection turning inward does not mean contemplation because the content of your body and the content of your mind is an ecamelytosubstetse isnt  you gathered it from it  what you gather from outside can be yours  but can never ever be you so we are talking about in a anginering not as twisting and turning the body not about taking on new attitudes of love or generosity compassion what were great i use and emotions that a human being can have  all that as a consequence of a certain way of being the then looking at as a means to get somewhere everywhere people are talking about whatever  if you deprive somebody of something for a part of time implonquallityeswillraise to heaven to the invaluable people are talking peace of mind is the ultimate goal of human life why  the ligednoutintheirmans  we would be to be the highest  because you re talking about dutyof christian oh  the origin of where it came from i havent a been telleviu i am  i was to get there that morning and speakatsictedinthe evening i was flying into my lane because of

gebeterunyani so as i went in  below greeting me and one man comes up and a selam i ask him what does it mean he says this is the highest way of greeting i said well that your opinion but what does it

that and i say  a a i say he is on is easy as i was easy  healing his heart because a mac  you know we have our oceans and if we dont know that answer  tassanofwedontknowthewithe it means we consult a body so i  some ways we can do still it  i made an easy  but healing healing is really where the art of metiinlise and get and healing is where the spirit in a suffering  traminsintsurgerya all use  how a you propose that we and as a healing  i i want a spirit of healing in the rlseversonthebedside olishhadonb offended by what i say but you must look at this properly if i  i dont but if at any time if it becomes necessary i must go to hospelo it i want efficient two  i don't want love because i am not deprived like that now unfortunately  creating a population where everywhere people are talking about love we are deprived like this because early age deprivation of la will tell right through your life it is  modenttoanytor to stand that there is something more to this life than the acquired word  body which we a quick theres something more there is a whole tradition in india unfortunately it s a apridlyanishing because of the it  changes that are happening in the society otherwise how a mother should deal with the child to be tiles for and a half years of each in the in the wernatali languages  safe that she should wrap herself a on the child in every possible way not because the food that you give the cat the meltthetugive the child is not the only enoihmant the tire net to be wrapped with motherhood then only this child will grow as a fully child otherwise it to grow as a deprived child but modern said  we are going to a place which is almost impossible to deliofthis it s simply not possible in the way we obstructed our families it simply not possible to do that so having said that when people come  hospital they should just look forward to efficient treatment now we are looking for love we should have found a some else at least we should a water dog  you can find anybody dog is no if you get you tell for dog twevleersgatindeedloverfat   does it matter how badly behaved you are is gatanteet we ll not work with any human being  a whole lot of management to do with human beings  a dog  we badly behaved you are  drunk you had behave  you beat him do what you do but the dog still lose  indeed lofafe  those of you were looking for louwedo  go go is a good solution  when i will  it you dont expect you a doctor to love  just do what he has to do so that is fascinating  oh i think patience come to  as this lissustheunfortunate this is unfortunate reality that s what i m saying  people come to a hospital and looking for love wrong place so when i was a  i was a  i was the pastor of a durchumantown and i would write my sermons on hospital know  is before the mars or i serving at the nursestision and by the tending is is she came up to me and he said  divisions a the priesseseay i said  we ve that a and  so when i was a  i was in  is and you serious  that people come to their did and they had  and made it be  maybe to pain in their hearts ah and i think people come to their a position and they look more absolution aceis forgiveness they look to feel well  perhaps the cretiinoofmotourmedicineisthat trangigitehillbutfevo  it is if you see that you bring the same in more medicine  he s pectaionshouldbeenlesie a care  and thats what were trying to do to to sink he is a line  maybe the world is becoming more secular atherenothedon'tknowherehinturn and so he welmonstatheirhelerprovire for a for a  let s i say  it's not about being secular nonticular  whole lot of human beings are feeling lonely yes right from their childhood they ve suffered loneliness or that i deal reasons changes have happened in family structure changes of happened in the social structure the communities of the past have broken so it is a certain loneliness where even if they go a their car mechanic  want to be loud  you must go to a  just the way you and your karma  somebody who knows how to fix the car that's important he loves you or not is not your business but when you talk about  as another dimension we re preparing people like this and bringing up hundreds of people where we have identified in the yogic  pulchaemanintyogicscience the fundamental life energy manifests itself in five different  five fundementawise these fire out of this fire this is called  you samana  upon  no  in this that is one damenshoncorndsamanowi which is very healing  before we introduce any kind of medical knowledge to a person we put them on very serious inner work to genaly a certain level of samana  where a physician develops such a level of vitality if you walk into the room everything should light up we impotent  physicians are walking into the patients room with a grave face grave is one thing that you should not point at when somebody sick grave is one thing that you dont show a patient  a physician should generate such a level of vitality and life and healthfulness about themselves anything that that will get better naturally not because of love not because of compa people you know yesterday i was being intevuedby young lady and she said do we must and i  things should have an other compassion i asked her are you  it s tesmahasbeniswating in the recapsn i said suppose when you go there after this into  you realize that your husband married you on a compassionate basis  who you like it this is a then why he wanted for me  i dont either o  and i am i a  so for the esufoundis  with the thousands of full time volunteers the millions of part ianteers why do in the  tools of dansfermation the tools of subjective in nature  right now we as human beings are dominating this world  only because of our ability to use tools otherwise a pack of dogs would take it or you forget about the tigers and the lions poor tigers and poor lions who need to be sealed right now only because of our ability to use tools isentit and all the tools that we developed are now as a doctor maybe you re using a microscope we have a microscope only because we abilite ability to see to an hence that we have a scope we have a delescop only to anhence awelvisionin some of the  we have a telephone because we can hear when i conform because we can speak we have a bacicl because we can  if he had made like trees would we have invented a bicycle a mask every tool that we created is only in to enhance the aldery existing faculties to air level isn't it everything everything that we invented is just this all the tools the tools are very important when i effortothespiruldimengsionarstool some of our people will feel offended around me and i said  dont say it it is more than our life now  the word tool then i tell them  cumedeleovercentercreede i will give you plumbing job no spanner no wrench no nothing you dleittwrthyour hands you can use your teeth  you will see all your ten nails will be gone then if you people be gone after three days then you come to me i will give you a spanner will you worship the span of a no i m asking you  will you wishipdthesspanodornow it is the to similarly to turn inward to extend dimensions which took our every one of you have one piece in your life or some moment  you must tell me as one  you have not do in your life you are on less in your life you  havonextasiinyourlefe love in your life you are capable of all distinct only thing is it s not sustainable one moment dare one moment here one moment there one moment here this is the only problem isn't it as i gave you a tool subjective to which you can remain blissful every moment of your life is it of great well you to you i m asking  a this many and to people they have tasted the tools of transmission thing i have done to them  i am confused the helocte  so what is that tool of trancefariondvoleg  so this is the first first thing is  get confused  yes because you are talking about anchoring the swamsaingthis confusion means you realize that you do not know esentit i am asking with all this exploration of it do we know even one single atom in its entirety hello do we  no then what i a problem in saying we dont know i do not know is an immense possibility now you re trying to destroy i do not know with all kinds of beliefs why don't you say i do not know if you truly realize i do not know your intelligence will be in a active and super alert state every moment of your life the moment you believe it sleeps lets you sleep but people are not willing to go through  they want something tell them something they want to believe and i am fine i want to sleep tonight no i do not know if you see i do not know  longing to know the  no no the sir seeing do not will happen to you everything that you do not know you just believe  somebody said so even if it is true right now i m won to tell you what is the crook but it's not in our expridience so what is the options that you have you can believe me or you can disbelieve me isn't it if you believe me you will not get any plosititrut if you disdolove me you will not get any closer to crop it is just that if you believe me you will have a positive story to tell if you disbelieve me you will have a negative story to tell but you will not more an inch exestentially psychologically it will give you comfort so this is something you must decide are you looking for solace are are you looking for a solution if you re looking for solution then you need tools to turn inward if you re looking for solace believe something the first death is i don't know what you do then  so  in this happened to me when i was just four for a males of  so only one day i realized i do know a thing i was only about four and a half years of age if somebody gave me a glass of water i would just sit like this the three four hours a district because i wouldnt know what is water i am telling you even today you don't know what is what it is only substance with in all the pre states on the planet two tours of your bodies what  to go to the planet is what  but you dont know what it is we know how to use it but we dont know what it is  i  we know how to use this water in so many ways but we do not know what it really is  cause we do not know what really anything is for that matter so if i found a leaf i  simply sit like this for sixcelandhours if i sat up in the bed and time night i t be staring at the darkness  dear father was a physician  thinking i need psycheticofvaluition he thought he started saying this boy has lost it she is just having at something all the time my provlemies i look at this and i dont know this i am not able to shift my attention to that i am just looking here still he thought he could educate me he tried  so that is a anstotrom in the house between seven in the evening to nine in a time you  children four of her siblings we oarpositanreadsometextbook i open my textbook like this i find a little speck on the paper i just look at the paper  this speck keeps me engaged for two hours sit like this absolutely total attention  thotreading a wood i went to school like this  i was very consistent always  utsixcedalsineveytesfaso if its silent shall now  shinordlove  it is just life a  just live  none the  your promesaslife as i is the purpose life is life itself  life itself is a large enough phenomena it doesn't need another meaning or  because human beings have not experienced life they re just a bundle of thoughts emotions ideas opinions  entities and pejlicious because of the theyre looking for the meaning because they re psycholoicanscape has overshadowed the existential life that they are right now all that their expedientingesaminimalistic mind natilig if you look at life what is the nature of life as you sit here we re breathing face hello  those who are not rellyedmaiecoleenche  we re breathing breathing means in some way this life is in communication with the tarrecmusthi in fact this ah this green  a project greenhands of planting trees then tie a moment was instigated like this by me i took a bunch of people about three to four thousand people came i said  cisukathe i i have into meeting in a village  there was a big tree a entry of fhotrivortriesweretheiatlodge but  in the meeting aonleven o'clock in the hordcanne in sheeranenia so i stood there and i am speaking to them they are a sisseting like this slowly as the sun gets hotter hour they just wilting away and i m speaking and speaking something telling them stories and in writing how theyre just weeping  to walking in the sun is one thing if you simply sit there you just on you  the this thaningwat and to see it  become like this heartless  the even after about an hour and a half andereearly going down then i say get a olosyou and i dinner walk them undknowthetshadshadeupthetree ah you will know what it to ease only you sit in the sun in hot sun for an hour and a half to  and walk under the tree  i adadise  the a ha i made them sit down and said see what you exhale the trees are inhaling what the trees exhale you re inhaling look at this one part of your lung is hanging up the  and i created a process with which they could experience this the dosatthereligtiseretursintheirliyes and that is it project greenhands twenty seven million trees though planted and now you can do the  in an planting because now they see it s a part of them is it not true that you exist here as a part of everything else  just that it s a privilege do you are a speck in the one  less than a speck till we are given an intellect given senses of perception we can experience this like an individual but in reality so you have you can  exist by yourself even for a and an a second isnt  then tireuonewasis supporting you so the only way life can happen is an inclusive way so yoga means just this  wodyourgamians union union means the boundaries of what is inward and outward you took it away there is no such thing as you and the other if you sit here  ndoanexpeementectually and one with tamelos if you sit here and suppose for one moment you experienced all this people here as a part of you  like you experience the five fingers of your hand how is it possible  so what is this body today yesterday it was not your body isn't it  food todays becombotial so something that is not you became you how right  is water this is not you you  drink it does it become me definitely us  what is it that i have done  ncoudedtiintothis oundries of my sensations what is within my boundaries of sensation i experience is myself what is outside of my boundaries of sentitian is not me no the yogic system developed a way that if you keep your enities in a certain level of exiiance now you will see your sensory body will expand if you re sensitybodybecame as large as this hall and you experienced all these people as yourself after that do i have to  i love them don't had them dont kill them  nadlemebecom it would teachings be necessary for you  if you experience something as a part of yourself after that you don't need any morality you don't need any a tick you don't need any wall you  what is you you will always handle it what is you it is of the host concern to you if you experienced everyone and everything as yourself this is what you go means if one is in such a state of union then i call it a or if you turn and twist your body and hang upside down you are not a yogi or justlings  yes  fortunately people think by turning and twisting their doing yoga no  means you sat here you experience and tieunoursas yourself not as a heuconation but as a living experience not in the firmament of your mind but ecetentially you know this is you now you dont need any policy you ve donneadany morality you dont have any scripture you dont and any guistan for many were you will conduct this sense of  to the best of your intelligence and capability and that s all a human being can do  a  we have a few minutes to  my way a is tucafatofthepointmicsubroterothebeliev can i tell a  was a i ve veinbeliefindvel you re trying to gather more information  as it is i

 by acquiring more information you will not become enhanced it is just that if you approach infermissionssensibly you will become more hungry if you approach information as a way of projecting

experience what i a like  it is only a mathematical coalition it is not really anybody s  that is no human being on this planet past or present was ever experienced an idea there s no such thing it is only a mathematic calculation to somehow come to terms with the immeasurable diengence of the existing re time to somehow quantified it comes into our understanding but nothing comes into our understanding as science explores more and more it is only getting more confounded the only these and why sciensissadrivingisebecau throwing out useful technologies on the side if that was not there science is far more convisdin under years of exploration than it ever was before but that's a good time if they had made stupid conclusions there would be a one more religion science is confounded

for the first twenty twenty one years of my existence as a teacher as if  i never appeared in the media never once  to a point where media started it  about me he s running some kind of a secret school because i refused to meet the media no aadroiceman no any kind of course dos  an abroiha  by word of mouth millions wokpetle came  because once it works for somebody they wanted to work for their family  friends and things that  happen in the last fifteen years or sixteen years now fifteen actually from two thousand one is when you have heard about me all over because  making a lot of nuts in the last fifteen years because these projects i was stated a small and the wars in the local area one so well and they became such medoroects of planting trees  uation help real active in fifty the thousand willigus so it needs an  or otherwise this can be done  and a non relijiusmoment which doesn't offer any miracles like this never before as i know in the last two hundred threanideas never before a spiritu moment has caught on this kind of following where not to go to heaven no medical  no any kind of stuff only thing i m telling them is bad doing them that you are the source of all your troubles  nobody else would you but meonstoegathering hichisrearyfantasticlecola steliethis about thirty years ago when i conducted programs over eighty five percent of the people came because of health reasons physical mental ailments to day on a  only about twelve percent of the people are coming for health reasons the rest of coming because they re seeking they want to know they want to experience the  want their lives to be touched in a deeper way than the way it stuchright now this is a phenomenal team that you're seeing in the world  never before i think  only twelve percent are coming for helphadecens at one time  ityperscentablecomingforhelthlesence which is a big shift i i i question  from a move there in the in the front in you  rosedtoknow  to do a toamanpaeadwadinthemymint or more a i dont he to now even the by her pysicalilleshavhaveyoueegrangsdisiglilancs  then i  must understand the at two kinds of ailments and the oggixistemlelookat helthesshosis to waste one is caused by external organisms which i think modern medicine has handled in a phenomenal way  in fact the birth of modern medicine happened mainly because the epidemixendpandemixwhichwae happening at the pie where it would wipe up popolicions it is that it inspired people to experiment do the things that they did  when they found solutions that is when suddenly the the prustof the population shifted from one or another simply because they could eliminate epidemic and these were caused by etemoganatencs but seventy percent of human ailments are on self help that is they cause it to themselves in so many we for whatever reasons niingly annoingly to themselves this seventy percent of ailments that people cause to themselves can be undone from within but if you have an infection you must go to the doctor i have no monia you must immediately go to the top  goantclaetodoyorgaee  i now over instances we have thousands and thousands of  but i would say hundreds and thousands of people who walked out of the ailments without ever being treated for them we don't treat people for yoga i must tell you this because they were in a medicalinstu a bunch of doctors from united states came to our yoga  we were we have a youbecospitale  about twelve of them  from this michigan area and they came and staefortredayssin on the fourth day they were very upset and they wanted to leave i was very busy i would meet them  or somebody came into  all these doctors are very upset they wander  what happened theyre just very upset that that is now youll be costpretyhere you tell them that is youll be cospretythetingthere is not you'becosspiton then i said okay let me see  then i saw them there  weolyupsettheyewereangry there we their  cheated that there is no you because he were of the passions were  i am nurses and doctors walking up and down  he s a  time on that day maybe there were over seventy patients  i said i thought i put them to good  i was making them work in the gardens  nobody should ever understand sickness is a reward they must want to get out of it askquitly as possible like now we absotingpatients in such a way  i would want to be sick whenever they want a tension not just that one important part of the yogic treatment  what is called as but should this  s sinking and purifying the elements within you  to  water air fire and space these five dimensions you can work this is the fundamentals of yoga to one of the most important thing is i want them barefoot with open hands to work in the go  and to just get a touch with the earth the outside get  touch with the air water earth half the amentavgone treatment is that a little bit  is all just connection with the world  this is a composite of all these things you remove yourself and keep yourself in a completely ealinlatmusheu you are not in touch ffolingjusevothegroonalltit you lose can contact with what makes your laugh  the very sorry which you carrying as your body  not important that it needs to be touch with it  its oigence no you re looking up  your life happens from this planet the other danencensstoit of  but prisip help and the physical nature around you are weary closely related if you don t connect them  is an accident for most people  i see america probably has the highest incidents of aliis such a  a very high this is me because they they went for me everything that s natural they re not in touch with anything that is natural thing is tamperdwith those who are living in the open  america i m sure they have no all  the no issue of any kind  in fine i think the  people are the most healthy people in them  the enduring all kinds of you know variations in  and still managing pretty well without heltgip rblyttimethrouhonetmor question ah  are there she  how a eyecudingtonamleas how to owoyuswyintendenbece  i i came in  i tell you  was that internal peace or detrunlpece in a lie  intentarls now back  who sherigonetreugh an  it s be so happiness and joy of love  it can only be internal and only e tell now the many ways to address this but one simple way is just this you just have to learn where the kebordisefor  this big computer of your mind right now you dont know where the kibordis your  in it somehow something works   he should know where the keyboard is you  i out the right things isn t  funamentlyits just that your mind is not taking inshuchansfrom you don t ask for peace no ask for joy don t ask for laugh is you have to understand the mechanics of a  this body and this mind works and then you cause whatever you want you so  like to in case  if you want love cause it  nheadcausitlettattobut  trust you that if you are capable of causing pleasantness or unpleasantness in you you will choose the highest form of pleasantness for yourself i trust you on that one now that to on started with this fifty four percent of doctors suffering it is unfortunate doctors all  and then a rendering a very key aspect of so is to any given society weyimpartintthedearewell  i i would like to make this offering that the doctors who are interested in this we would like to offer them the tools of inner engineering so that they go out as truly healthy joyful life which is full of why tell that their very presence is an inspiration for health for everybody who comes in touch with them this must happen otherwise what are we talking about health we talking medicine man  is a business help is an aspiration but every human being if this fundamental aspiration is not fulfilled you cannot lead a human being to any of the aspiration right now there is some trouble in your body i will talk able enlightenment  to a mask   your back is aching i will go enlightenment you re not interested with my backadgoll lets only question is  because body has this power  less you keep your body in such a way you don't know whether it s here or not this is what you orgamings that your body becomes like breeze you sit here you dont know whether your body s here a lot otherwise if you sit here for one and a half  your body says i must go to the bathroom  boysisamasdringoubo as i must do something  it is in a state of compulsive needs if you bring it to ease on all levels you will not know it the bodies here a not if you are in set  see you are not even conscious with that its here or not you have not genedeisus you don't care what you are a man or a woman right now yes it should not matter that saying they re only two places where your gender should man hbadoms and bedrooms no it else so to be evingdevadtat  a  a  is the thing  everything in the not a rate  but i m saying to move the body from compulsive  to a place where is like a stepping stone an impediment for your life right now the compulsiveness of the body is making people do all kinds of things in the world  or a we toruherraseto a place where they can do something other than the compulsive things that every other creature does simply because they ve not kept their body as it should be kept this body can be upgraded to a place where it in function like an antenna which will download the cosmos even if that do then happened to you  now the physicians of the world at least they must become an embodiment of health and white  this must happen whatever is needed from our  willing to do for anousidolittle  and i am doctor to  thing  and i  a less thing i  or a very do  a
