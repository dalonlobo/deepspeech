 no so or an man  no  mirnagoodon leversardea land gun  maiadedberdteurcila withouttononeerebodythexcellentisandledysomegentlementhankitfilbeg knownsugre and good afternoon take your excellencies and distinguished guests to all the meditators who are watching on the internet right  i'm so grateful to be here and i and it's such a privilege really to be here my name is maxwell kennedy not been a i learned how to meditate from sudgroe a few years ago so we're here at the united nations and their forts maybe forty or sixty ambassadors here in seventy different countries and people and were here to talk about sustainable  so why did you start with a chant the campissaandinocation and in orkisnean to perform different types of activities lied to howeranegetsindifferent way this most people have become competent in one way the other but if you ask them to do something totally  they will find themselves totally at loss this is simply because their energies get ted in one way only and in oucatianmeans you kind of make yourself malleable in such a way that for every different type of action you need your energies in different parts of your system and you are able to gredudtha at that in such a way to perform that specific activity so when i sit here what we need to do is different from what i was doing when i was walking down here so this is just calibration using sounds if we have to know the meaning it's in about how but is sweetness but death is compassion so ill women think that is a terrible thing but  and reglad that some day we were dysuppaswecouldnotdi that would be terrible somthi suppose becondayacol a a all the is talking about yoga in the sense the chant is describing yoga as a way of transcending time when we said tonseningtime right now we have a sense of time only because we are so identified with our physical nature suppose we did not have a body we would i would not have any sense of time a boditskaeping time think that this time is psychlical but you ogaisadiamonsion which wants to transcend which helps you to transcend is cycles and make a journey beyond i nature of life which is the nature of physical exist  thank you  i had a teacher at harvard who was a medical do and he told me a story that i when he was a young doctor he went down to missussip and he saw children there in the united states it is a  sixties who were starving after that trip he went to washington d c he had died he tried to meet a group of senators  no one after the other none of them would talk to him on sunday afternoon he got my father's phone number at home  atherhssenaterobertoftenedy and my sister carrie who runs the robert of kennedy memorial is here right now in my wife  so that he got my dad's number and he called  and it was sunday my dad's with the children and and and he said to him i will all right  come over and we'll talk after they spoke my dad went to missussip to where this side doctor had gone and when he came back he wrote this so as he said these words on and there are others on the backroads of mississippi where thousands of children slowly starved their lives away their minds damaged beyond repair by the age of four or five in the camps of the migrant workers  nomads virtually unprotected by collective bargaining or social security minimum wage or workman's company pose to the cars of fate and the cruelty of their fellow man alike and on indian reservations where the unemployment rate is eighty percent and where suicide is not a philosopher's question but the leading cause of death among young  so after that trip my father went back to the senate  or with a group of others and they it they created the first food stamps program in the united states and that is kind of the development model that i'm used to so when i look at the all developmentcallsof the united nations my immediate reaction is to think are the addis of of  its going to fund this or not but you have a different approach can you talk about yoga in that context so when we say sustenable and goldsweare talking about human well being  singhemanwelbing as in different issues which concerns poverty and help women issues and violent this kind of things let we talking about him and well being how can you transform the world without transforming intuit of human being  this is the effort that's going on in the world for a long time we want to transform the world but we have not aiming at individual human being the world is just a word it is just you and me if there is no transformation in you and me if they did not change in the way we per  is an feet think feel and act in this world how can you can the world so we can pump in money we can have projects they will all go up and go down but only if we transform individual human beings on a large scale only then there ll be true transfer  this is why yoga becomes a significant thing today the united nations taking this step taking up this international yoga day of very important step  say it to the vrousionallyappro because without  farming indivdulhim in beings you cannot really sense on the world because there is no such thing  and reality and reality  just you me and someone else i'vevallofistained the world has changed if we if you so  we will be only talking about it i've been to any number of international peace conferences and everybody stolibouewordbecin one of this  s where there or seventeen laureates i asked him a simple  is it is it true that all of you  to you peaceful human beings can you put your hand on your heart and say i am peaceful they admitted not a wovidoknow how to a peaceful but we want the world peaceful how is that possible what what you see as the world is just a large a manifhetition of who we are grow you can see all around the world in brazil in the united states in la where i live people are doing yoga when we're doing it we're i'm stretching out my body trying to control my breathing i can you explain what yoga really is and how that can help taintey asdeges so this fundamental human longing for help being for  men of life then you find a lot called correct and sitfigl a sutainable way then we said this is yoke a means in search in pursuit of human wellbeing we've been doing all kinds of things we've been looking up for a long time which is led to by being divided in the name of and go creeds in so many different ways now in the last fifty years have utabean looking out seriously nreliping the planet apart all the mimentaldigradition that we are talking about is just in tusut of human well the  in the last hundred years le we are the most comfortable gennevationever but we cannot say we are well because we hit not really well people not happy people are not basful that is not happening because we have not at rest in a nature so when it when you address it in a scientific manner rather than by belief by philosophy by  is you address human well being in a scientific way this is yoga the word yoga litterlymeans union when mister union what we're talking about is we are talking about if i a way of obliterating your the boundaries of your individual  when i say a scientific way of obblilating the boundaries of your induidulnaturewhartdisminses right now as we sit here this is me that is you distinctly clear but we are breathing the same  we are we are a product of the same earth what you call as myself is just a pop up on this planet and it ll pop out but in this little bit of time we have divided this in such a way that we can't meet means you oblitlytey this individual boundaries not intellectually not by belief not by idealiy but as a living expert will be launched them and this was there on the radio we launched a very lord  in mental project in southern india the fundamental for this came from this this happened to me when i was in the university simply about eight years ago when i when i happened to in my home town a very long time one of my english teachers came up to me and said now  understand why you would not let me teach robert frost i said lamp i i not let you teach at opitfrostarleggrovtrish see it on you remember you didn't let me to ross then i remembered she came one day till then we were reading only english poets she came and inteduced the ameranfoyt and she said rarertfrostittagreat man and then she started off or her louly and deep i said stop i said a man who calls a tree a wood i don't want to listen to disgu a  she had no a is a very glad for it i said i don't care how great he is he calls tree a wood dormordelizendtohim then when we wanted to start this is s in a sadthenindiawhenwe found that we were worgoinggryandekgaundowaderwas sinking whererelapedl when i decided we will plant hundred and fourteen million trees in time  the simple thing that we did was i took thousands of people made them sit in the trees and we set up a yogidprucsess with which they experienced that what they re breathing  the treated inhaling what the trees are ceiling there inhaling and they realized one home of the lungs is hanging out there once they realize this there is no stopping and today millions of trees are being planted on a all basis all done by common people simply because of a brought this yogic experience to them that they truly is that one half of the reading apperaesis actually out there not here so bringing this experience into people that what you think as myself is within the boundaries of your physical nature it goes well beyond that if this becomes a living reality then fulfilling these goals that united nations has for the world  becomes much more possible than the way it is right now where we are trying to push in one way but a whole lot of people are pushing in opposite direction because they don't even see as the  he is a girl i i want it to point out this incredible thing about the tree planting project is that sud guru  ted that the trees be planted on small plots of land less than half an acre half of the trees are fruit trees and then half of them can be used for firewood so that the people who live on these lands are  from them they take care of the trees and those trees actually really grow one of the things that that's really working on is is poverty when i look at the world today and i see especially in the united states this a gap between people who have capital and people who don't i it's a it said very disturbing sign to me a that this the gap between rich and poor can you talk a little bit about how yoga would address that in terms of sustainable develop we must understand this that we have chosen it cannot an economic model which is all about everybody for himself for her  there is no larger commitment to humanity as such because that is market economy by does according to their own is and skills and grab warddickangrab its litil and school economy but we have gone for this simply because he so  ilisticcomministic  so unfortunately fail notnessiily because theyre bad because human beings are not ready for that the  that is poor people who had nothing wanted to share the rich never wanted to share  so it became a joke in the world if we lit had to if rich had the consciousness to share is a bit of in a great idea but the poor want to share rich don't want to share so that is the same situation here and this is the same situation building up everywhere else in the world he is the best way to run the world no but do we have a better  so because right now we are in that place so the only thing that we can truly do  that we bring what is this what we are leftning to as yoga as a living expert it does not reinteistingyourbody yoga does not mean standing on your head yoga does not mean holding your breath means in some way you have transcended the limitations of your physical nature you are beginning to experience life  a possibility not just this physical form that you are once this becomes a living expert sharing and living together will become a common experience everywhere does it mean we go to start commaancs and everybody would live together no we can run lssisinamoreinplusiveway we can create a more in  no one and this need not be done by gormentpolesy this can be done by private into a  cause there are companies which are almost as large as nations today their companies which budgets which are bigger than nations so it is very much  that business can be run in a more inclusive way right now  we thinking only of profit our idea of profit is very dumbkinof idea if you really want to run your company if you are thinking in terms of your company prospering in the next hundred violentoehascandanousl then it's very important that you make your customer your partner that you make everybody else in the society your partner whatever you are manafactering or whatever you're selling or whatever the business sees whether you are selling a safety pin or a computer or a fish  to let the business is about him and love  if this is this comes into the consciousness of every business person if this comes into the consciousness of building every business that  is this is about him and well being wedoed in so many ways but fundamentally  but that ive thisowaveness and consciousness in still in the businesses on the planet then you can find the captilisticweof living need not mean disparity can mean well being to everybody i i read the other day that that for every dollar in government investment the i in developing countries that there's seven dollars now in private invest so how do we use yoga to ok in the the private corporations that are looking just at their bottom line to end up really having development that there in just in the last media so  only focused on the business leaders because a time a few hundred years ago where the most inflenceiolleadeship on the planet was religiouslyteship later on when the millidrymessines built up in a big way the millitriledes dominated the world in the last hundred years early elected leaders have become the most dominant force in the next fifteen to twenty five years you will see the business leaders will be the most important or inflenciallidship on the planet the good thing about business is that man is willing to make a deal live the deal is good no matter who you are i am saying the old pritidice of i cannot make a deal with somebody is going away and they're willing to make a deal thing is sustainable only if it is beneficial to both the parties nothing can be sustained either in the marketplace or in marriage unless it's beneficial aboard the parties when it's truly beneficial to both the parties this can be sustained this is slowly sinking into the business leadership i have seen in the last twendie business leaders their way of thinking is very were different than what it was my essential work has been to move individual leaders from their personal ambitions to a low evigion because a large erisonmeans then the business is is  a for a long fitted of time if it's just your personal ambition the world will work against you if you have a low division the world will work with you this is a big difference so this is something that is slowly sinking and you will see if you see annual meetings of a man is what they're talking if you look at the old economic forum if you look at weios economic  in my assemblies on the planet you will see that  in to talk about a law envision how to make a difference rather than how to make a profit this is become the language of the business these days it still has to manifest in a big way but at least the language has changed from profit to making a difference thakeyutthougtgrowwhenyoulookatsocigtingallaroshebol  what's available to women was tell  a  adevelopanclsaddressthis how what's the role of gender equality in you so your gamnminssi transcending your physical lane on on live if you transcend your physical nature where is the question of being a male or a  you being a male or a female is relevant only in a few spaces in your life in bathrooms and the rest of the places i don't see why you should recognize somebody as a man or a woman i d to we identifying people with the yprouctoryorgans if you must use a body part rpesusedte brain  in a  small gender difference that is there bereenat to foofil a certain aspect of hour life is being stretched too far this is from another period where it was not possible for a woman to participate because of the idea of physical situations in the world and that is largely level to the in most parts of the world and it's rapidly changing everywhere i would say i think a more active effort is needed at least by law in most nations it is hundred percent equal by practice there is still is which has to be what that i felt a generation of  once the older generation moves out the anger enilation is not looking at it that way anymore at list i see that in all the  countries it is only people beyond sixty years of age who think on in this small and people are not thinking that way anymore or  as the one more question because i i went on a save time for the audience in my waiting to talk to and on can you for tell about how you conceived the world in thirty years what i see hes a for the first time for the very first time in the history of human  human intellect is sparking like never before more people in the planet to they can think for themselves than ever before in the history of this im in existence so once human intellect begins to spark like this unless something is logically correct and signtoffityofgreretofiveb it will fail in future you may be willing to live in to a few things but your children are not going to listen to anything that does not make sense to them it does not matter from what authority it comes from or in other words we are moving into a  we it cannot be the truth truth will be the only eppolity in future we are getting there because everybody is beginning to ask once and people are not afraid to ask questions anymore so this is bound to happen once this happens in as  in for well being has to have a logically correct and scigntifitlasetenable i and its a map to me and that today the internationallyogaday has been last in the last to one ear the was modeed we the plaminister but it was almost like the world was waiting for it as they mentioned seven countries never before in the history of united nations all of them eglidupon one thing as negaeled upon yoga it looked like they were waiting for it yes the world has been waiting for a scientific and a logically correct an for human well being the aspiration for him and well being will not stop unless we provide a proper santificallystructured sioligy than people in terms of well being will moetewardschemicals this is a deep a grave concern in the world the number of people moving towards alcohol and drugs in the last twenty five  must be maybe five under a thousand percent more than what it was twenty five years ago this is mainly because in pursuit of him in well  there are no logically correct answers to that  that is the reason why human being so seeking this kind of selu unless we provide this this is a natural progression i see in the next thirty years to fifty years that would be a big moment towards i process for in a well being and this is the right time to be here at this  hum  this yoga becoming a worldwide thing we must understand yoga is not an indian thing if you want to call yoga indian then you must call gravity our open okay cause yes it it originated from that place because is one place where for a few malania we have a time to look deep in words to look at the human mechanism in at most profoundness as to how this functions what is it  lie within this human mechanism this is taken a few  and to understand and arrive at this possibility a i want this message to go the science of yoga is not just about health it's not just about fitness it is an outer etsalution for the every aspect of human ex that is different types of you get yoga can be thought in the in the ultimate possibility raising beyond our physical nature the ultimate possibility of knowing life in its fullest way the word yoga means union the word you ll give me  one who is  as this union we need not one to five year is we need millions of them who have a sense of union with the rest of the universe let those who hold trespa see positions in the world they must come to this experience because leadership silly means you have the privilege of touching other people's lives what you think what you feel when what you do every single thought emotion and action either makes or re people's lives that's twardlinishship  when you are given such a privilege it's very very important that you are in a state of yoga that you experience life around do as you  if we if any of us feel the work that we are doing is important the first and foremost thing is we must work upon ourselves so you go for honor pleasure to first give the floor to a gentle  so i onambeawhotheewil also be delivering a message on behalf of the

from the yoga masters all the perspective as to how yoga can contribute in the attainment of global peace a future and in turn he realiition of the is die  what i understand without peace of mind and harmony in the body how can we think a we can change the world first we have to change our own world by which what i mean is how we leave with it think and aspire if we are not fit for the purpose of contributing to sestinablepiece in the war we willeminas byestenders and not as a  gensof change i can share my onicpersonal story with micholegues and others present here i had been suffering from a very bad bout of sadtikgaproblim for the last two months at times the pain was i i have gone through serious pain medication followed by physical therapy and accuban  in fact i am just coming here from my sixth session of aclbunchocrittment is that i suffered this problem because of acomoatedlihtstelrelated problems which included long hours of sitting standing dress from the work and also from the family for the constant change of places of postings et cetera during the last eight weeks of my ordeal i reflected on my life and future course of action i read a lot and search the internet for an  and i finally came to the conclusion that yoga is the answer to my situ although i did some yoga in my college days my biggest mistake was i that i discontinued that perhaps if i continued out of never faced my present rate  now the bujandutonourcoperippof  which is also known as many something is critical for the health of my spine there are many other a sense hans which can help me get my strength back as a a little better and able to practice those the ourcenswill not only help gain my physical strength but it will contribute to my mental strength for the meditational aspects of yoga i thought i'll share my most recent experien so that others like me in similar lifestyle situations can also learn and prevent the situation that i mean let's do yoga every day and not just one day in the year thank you then offer the floor to the desinglishpominenterisintetiwof georgia excellency i was thinking about as  ramsbut in fact a its not as much as asking quite  how what you told us echoes in in all of us it really does it really does because what we what we take from here from of this wonderful conversation that that we just had is like things are indeed very simple if we indeed try to  as  one who is really honored and humbled to be here as a representative of my country who was one of the vnwhocosponsort international day i'm an also a practitioner rather a very bad student to this cuodtattime tending  that school is called yoorviin daily life which is in united states in many parts of istenuraparticulary in regeustaneingcatto led by whichbagorosrswemmingmyhichworeanandogyahind what i learned from my to experience because after all the oneness is sharing this personal experiences also  what but underly said that it's vow having your mind free of disturbances and if we had indeed attain to be free of disturbances we find peace with our mind that can really transcend omehousstartthischanedreaction  illness and oneness that we all long for particularly in in this ten up i am glad that we have so many colleagues by now or calling from is my good friend was sits next to me is also yoga a pretty so and many and it is indeed probably high time watutismentioned when a prime minister of in  said that we need it internet a day of yoga it came in did one right right time and i'm glad that i was here on the right moment and right time thank you a for your presence  thank you for your blessing and indeed if we try to i think we can really attain that we are without disturbance and we find this oneness and unity and we take those and goals want by one and i really hope to and i'm looking forward to that day when we will no longer have this beautiful her of  in you because we will have that let it because as tigers in a way to me somehow a man  so if i were common failure too that we have to talk about as edges but it's good that we are starting to talk about it  we are making it happen hopefully and i believe in that yoga will create that that will permeate our or work in this organization in this chamber and other it thank you very much on shanti  and now for the floor to the disinglishbominentof they are litensstaellecyothefo i came from the probably most man all angle possible to yoga i was essentially dragged against my will seventeen years ago by then girlfriend into yovarclassand you know about myself as this big soccer player and cyclist and all these other things and thought really this is not for me to my credit i had to say already after the class while there is something there and that is something that is worth exploring that in doing yoga ever since there s one thing that i believe i will be doing until the end of my life it is you well because he every every one can do it every person of every age of every year a state of health really a is for every one which is i think one of his wonderful  is  the only thing is even if you come from that non spiritual place that i came from you realize over time that something happens with you and that there isn't it there is for me today no other way  conectingifh myself at my mind with my body the way i can in yoga sometimes i find out in when i do yoga that i before i did it  i know how i was that day at the moment i do it  i i do a few how i am im able to connect to myself and that also then pretyeprecondition for being able to connect the to connect  with others  you know in in looking at the theme and in thinking about this for me to connection is it is is very simple the asticiatarnd  you know tells us we know what the problems are we know what the solutions are we have to simply change our ways to get there and then we can do this together think this is ryoga can make a uchcontribuein if you think it's not for you tried one time and i think it will be for many we actually i think it's it is for everybody one of my you know small moments of happiness in life today is to take a person to yoga because that just makes you happy it is a ofringaclasstomorrowmorningtough some of your perenoth some of you in the room  on a come save with many others and i look really look qorridtodat ankisomon for now i have the one to a reconniceeaotheryougomaster  as a infacoryogmatdarcaoicoverouhasfindlusfotishewentalldtherifontiba he not me a summer in nosiridisbinwritdessoftorexxeencese gentlemen i i come from a tradition and lineage that from the time in the  have kept and shared with humanity the teachings of oil  a is a science that especially with mid meditation at the how many of the body emotions in the mind when these elements are in harmony the individual becomes calm and peaceful in his heart if the individual is calm and peaceful in his heart this termites in the community and thus in the world i can attest from my own experience that by learning these practices it is possible for everyone to awaken your own energies and achieve peace love and harmony deeply belive that if that if we as

message of love a a i now offer the floor to the distinguished pominantrepresentitiveofinival come from the pole from these to an hillsufnipo entry is extremely conducive for yoga and i also come from

whatever on wyshoulnlbe distracted harddituo by this things this is a part of a social thing it happens at the same time the core of yoga is not disturbed in any way on the surface that  mondestorchsanselanderey i would say for the larger public to start with  like this year when you about four months ago when i came to know that over nine thousand children bellowytenyeasohescomited so sad of india or seventy  at wilothetenusofitcomeatadsisi it i just thought if our children start come thing so side we re doing something fundamentally room  child is a fresh life a child is an exebiant life i should be a bundle of joy to of that they're deciding to take their own life which is deeply disturbing this is not a statement about the child who took his life but this is a statement about all of this what are we doing with our societies so after cuffeisaid lets that ten thousand cool but today with the cooperation of radiestiavegommentsveestutchingtheaenlythitythousand schools or two intimillitwo why i am saying this waetisis become possible is because we are offering what is qaldesfopoyor  pyougaman'sbreeogarsupeoga why this effort towards opu you go  if you offer yoga however inockisthe practice may look to start with it has a spiritual diamondcento  miingspilituldimendsiontoanundconscious propolation our not ready for it without a certain level of expertise in the teachers could be responsible or a bit of time rititientoporyourgavagehasmanly icllandpychological venefits here you can't do anything wrong  on the video all the teacher has to do is make corrections and make sure people are not doing it wrong think it's a good way to spread yoga in the world is to all pay  or your gird the woropeoginindinlanguages to the as acquired the meaning of be useful but accullytoridinitsromdisthatitsaprleokaarsubega that of start of your gates and it's best to start that way with large populations because when you start off spiral process for people many of them may not be lityfolit even if it's a good thing even if good thing happens to you when you're not ready for it things may not work what  so foyogarsaavery stinct away and a safe way to take yoga to the world im after this happens once the field of benefits once the experience what difference  makes they will naturally seek yoga in a more serious manner and that is when yoga should come into their lives this could saw the concern that you expressed but at the same time somebody is doing something funny in the name of yoga it doesn't concern me because those things will always happen but it's good that even commercial establishments are talking yoga this means it's really on holfollophonahisehomenbravly owisbe residentoleyougaclov rihtheootheyunisr  a  a is more than an instrument of posonratrusol  he has a meneltespeakyousoleme any sadgodoe  all the nation of that because the word yoga as to remember us do a means union in between the body and the  and between us and out of him a beer and between human beings and nature and it is because of that the and that in the  action that we are able to so many of your province with a many proent but we have to be of theistic because the sarusiol  by changing our werserps many of this is plattysolganisbetdouantheycoveroi in the covictthevoroltheabsesstoticknorouse and we have the will at the or if you can  but all that is not going to work unless we go adentivitonle a means torsorantrastormasun and because of that the in the massionallaofjoga should be on the fu  the to remind all of us that every day i know what life should be a yoga day namaste i know it the blotouhis  inaphlywhowith the exxicativedilectorof the office of the world health organization here of the united nations missbereoftheyanderfho it's a great pleasure and an honor to attend  tion today and indeed that this is a very unusual event for the united nations because it is the plearofa and its not as of their prayer here it speeches that people deliver in a more formal way i actually us all of us here to think deeply of what is being said what is being done what is being conveyed by you here and how we can individually uncollectidlyrepontd to this poll of for the intinationayogade i have spent five years of my life in india before coming here in new york and of course for me it's something special to be here today at this day special because you mention  a dead we cannot call  here and say that i you go is indian but it comes from india and indeed it is india's gift to the humankind to all over the world and it is very special because of that and i could see here  act of yoga practice it is in india so it makes a different is and this is why this is such a great gift of civilization the whole country in india every quarter of it breathes essence of yoga and it is the sole  calm of yoga that has moved me when i was there in my work we are dealing with healthy shoes it is no news now that yoga is very good for health but we also know now that health is no longer stand the long one of the sustainable devoldmentgals it is actually determineonfor any other all to to be a chief for yoga has a very different meaning and different indeed interconnecting nature because it does help people to feel better or breethebatteractbat  night better come into fitness which is indeed essential for sustaining our planet and connects planet to the people so therefore of course we know to days we thoumaniclenaltrials a helps in many conditions mental health conditions depression heart conditions many other conditions joint and then and so on so this is not new he has been to de  resistance to integrate yoga practice and other perhaps no medicine practices which are of for available worldwide but known also in india to integrate them to a venalepati so and this is its is solely being overcome we as the utraartainedtoput  are  put into this pro the the sea in may in fact india has signed and i would say landmark agreement with the world health oalization to promote to the  in yoga included and to ensure quality and safety of this additional practices  more soul to in gave this practices into our health services  my health care and all other services that we know so it is now he understood that as all of human beings need some or another kind of hell  be vaxinationif if they are very healthy or any other more so is they also need to practice yoga because it prevents many illnesses it also gives piece of mind it chs us how to cope with all those iffrenthingsthatorthern life tresputsonhumanabrain and therefore we stand forward and we want to support promotion and inclusion of yoga into called practice all over the world well coluberate with india on that but my question to to you would be is there any good secret beyond of what you have said how we can bring the this the friend the mentions of health together into great them in a better way make sure that yoga is no longer seen as something separate from from what we do in health services traditionally thank you thank you very much for being here today when  our commitment as to shift to help not to a particular system people are married to a particular system most to the time and the different that system at any cost no matter what very system in the world has something to  but this of being committed to health we are committed to those systems because of this there has been a lot of in in how health can come  so in sudan india in the little part of  dominate reblohtdisavo these five dimonsents at the in the  the unani and yoga took it active along with the natural or the warefrdoingthings it is done miraculous things to the populations we were the first pilot project why he is when it started ten years ago now i should become a ministry i think as to be over in the last week they odeclaretheriysunirsity which means i on where the  sit down all these things put together this we started almost fifteen years ago on today it is an active part what we have done is we have medical vans which go with the tick doctor and i sit the doctor plus we have created  one hundred and twelve thirteen village gardens where we grow herbs over hundred hundred and out types of herbs in a common piece of land where people are taught how to make use of it for small things like i had big fee or for the children dirliathese kind of things all our grandmothers knew how to pletthis lelevandfotthesepeoplearegoindto the doctors today the weight is being pleated with thelarverat medication linondurlindia the cost of the medicine if you fall sick for fifteen days it takes a year for you tricoer with the economics of the family gets hit for almost a  if fifteen days somebody's down and they visit the doctor and the volume of medication and treatment that happens kind of my sets them back quite a bit so we  a bus to health not to a particular system right now the donment of india is doing serious efforts to integrate this thing we have been doing this for over fifteen years very effectively i must tell you a simple thing in orerlindervwith can be i was just last one week  in africa even there i thought this is something that the work we created a esqualdes away with  about simple things how health can be created with within the family for every family one of the things that was done  to the teens one simple thing with it was every home should have up oppietryapanonatry a moungodtry and a patch of greens this trensfontheldsituitions in such a big way you won't believe such a small innecitie such a simple ninisato what a difference  done to people's lives like this smolenititwocenbebroughtbecause sittlingtheconomics of those families it's very important we need to come up with all that works for them in this yoga practice has a significant role because in a wiren  i wirlntondevere it is very very important to fulfill the sustainable goals if we don't create that kind of population we will be only talking about sustainability at it will not happen we it to create this and i go  the tons of self transformation should not be in the hands of a good or an  tion or some other authority the idea is to bring this into everybody's life like to the  by ansitutbrushs which is cleared arlheld just like that everybody should  some tools for self transformation it is with this kind of  commitment that we are going ahead there is a big support now in the world wherever regard in the limotesparts of africa that i was there in the last one week it was incredible to see that all of them noblyoga  or this twenty five years ago when i rented to rorelindia in a big way then you what is scokocollaettheydid not know what is yoga but today the himmotdetspartof africa people know what is yoga this is talmation in many ways  thank you so guy and how would you like to reflect on discretionsliketouthank you  that s been so much peryinthis rom and so much intelligence that what the world is all about and what we are all about and what would going to do about it and i think that the  it so i  surely fantastic just see hear and this  to all of the things that i pondered for so many years and wondered to  not a wish finding the answers but today was a revelation and a very special thing to happen to the whole world in this room you starts the wepnatevefor a long time out in the open now here is beautiful but yoga's only beautiful if we use it and we make it part of our life to thank you  i nougtedthefloretoeisuriiwollawhoweresdraingdusadtowafromtexas if you could help us understand the role of a guru of a teacher not in the true academy sense where them fessorteachtosmescigndsyndticnologybutrather coming from youmality and that you in that data union among all of us when you say sadbuoooeure saying and a educated girl that s what it means us you don t come to said the go to know about the scriptures you don't come to set out to know about rituals because the only thing that i know is i know this piece of life from itelitentoteldamitantisalikno by knowing this by inference you know just about everything because thing is made the same way to the there is something called as a constructional day where they're talking about how the atom and the cosmos are essentially  i same design only the sophistication and complexitiesmolteplying so there may burn the younmear made the same way only the complexity has mother play having said that in wardwayseagoodlrelevantemean you trying to walk an uncharted to  every year i trek in the hemales in the vartlentobe once you go into the mountains that illiterate serfar who is there who has not been to school but who if he says right you turn right if he says left you turn left you better do that otherwise you won't come back you do that because he knows the ten the same goes for this this is just an inutelen it's best to walk with somebody was aliedy walked the path otherwise all things will become complicated what is next door you won't go around the world and come back to it this complication about for exam today if you are to the word meditation people think something very difficult to do  to put it simply first of all the word meditation english word meditation does not describe anything in particular if you sit with your eyes closed they're saying you meditate with you is blowdyoucanlodepataperthaonathenasomebothesono  any number of things you could do or you might have just master that of sleeping and whetigoforsies it happened sepaat so when i am matetition we must understand it's not an act it is a quality it is like you want flowers in your garden if you want flowers in your  you don't have to sit there and do flower madidih you dont have a think flowers you have to think soil manure water said  have nothing to do with flowers but if you do those things flowers will happen because it's a consequence right now because we have gotten into this madness of being a god orietiehsociety we had interested in the flame  we are not interested in the plant this is the fundamental that the yoga will change within you you understand that you have to handle the process of  for a consequence to happen so in yoga that i e saying that if you go oriented your one i will be on the goal means you i find you a way only with one night it is an inefficient way of doing things if you use both your eyes to find your way it's much more efficient  is a good one that it can be done without it i m asking you a simple question even to learn a b c the orbit unieded a teacher but you could have lanted by yourself  do taken a lifetime but the teacher thought it to you in a month or two that's a big difference so like somebody was talking to me and there thats what is this good of a i said this is the deep  liingdepesfegooropositioninxsisten  if you want to find your way it's best in uncharted to  not to a  best to walk with somebody whos alludythundertellin once or manatime otherwise simple things will become very complex i pasityrecoui i said dinneaseportro who is the chair of the international yoga day committee at the united nations and an executive board member of the united  repleationconsoninlightenmentsacitic he intenattialday of yoga committee at the un came into existence last year in the summer after the first international day of yoga reethand more years ago his vision was to have peace meditations with the staff and he started the yoga club which in is the president of how do you see the un system meaning the secretarial staff who work here the diplomats from the different country is and the ngos civil society who tried to implement the estiges you see yoga bringing us all together thank you so much this is being said again and again about these so we need to look at this he is a peace or mental peace as people are talking about it today even so colspulatuleadestatalking about this being the has golin one's life but i would like to ask you this look at your laugh and see if you want to enjoy your dinner  even if you are not ecstatic at least you must be peaceful to enjoy your dinner if you want to enjoy the people around you at least you must be peaceful and happy if you want to enjoy your walk on the  you must be peaceful and happy otherwise is not  so what is very fundamental to a fundamental requedment in our life fortunately we are pushing it as an ultimate goal of our life to be peaceful is not the highest thing it is the most basically were if a human being cannot even be peaceful there is really nothing that they can do this means that you ll not even able to hear  your body and mind the way you should to look at it from one perspect all human experience has a chemical basis to it what you call as peace is a certain kind of chemistry or to call as joy and at the kind of chemistry unless another ecstasy another agony and the kind the fear testresstension whatever you call it every human  has a chemical basis to it we have not been thought about how to deal with this when i say how to deal with this as is if you want to look at this as a machine this is the most ofthistigata piece of technology on the planet the question is to deal with this high level of technology have you read even the user's manual that's a bush means it is the users manual of how to conduct this one i would say when you ask this question how to bring all these diverse people together in this organization it's best to start with the simplest process which does not even need a specific elovement of time this is where or foryougaverlgbecomeusswoo people can sit in their what spaces and right there they can do it three minutes i am the feel like it it does not need a specific condition he does not need a specific time if they see the benefit which they definitely will in a matter of two weeks time  i see a distinct benefit doing it wherever they are it does not need any kind of specific discipline or time other conditions required for no  pre ogato be done i think this would be a good way to intiglat them because is created all religion this is not about yourssusmadtthe why i said this is not indian because a science cannot be indian yes it originated from india ndealsweareproud of it but it does not belong to india the very fact that united nations has declared an international yoga day mean he s gifted it to the world it does not belong to india anymore  it's it's not something that we have to possess a nitdentivioweth the significant aspect of my personal work has been do im all all the fruits of culture that yoga had acquired through this milaniaftransmission slowly whatever you do in a particular culture it will arquireacutovandfrils so one thing is to take off all the coultivilfrills and presented as an absolute science and a technolity for well being this is an important thing in an organization like this where there are people from even  there are people from every kind of denominations every kind of faith of the kind of believed of the kind of idealities it's a betoveryimportant that yogaisbrought as a proper science not as a cultidl thing not as an in living its very portentdrhothe
