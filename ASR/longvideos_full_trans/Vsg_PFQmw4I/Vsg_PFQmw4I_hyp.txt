most beautiful thing about time is i should do something it passes by  they should do nothing it passes by  if you joyful it passes by  is a miserable it passes will  its absolutely just no matter who you are or you are  everybody it passes at the same speed only thing is our experience of the time could tedifirent  depending upon how intensely believe  or how slack y  is your ready slack would lie  it looks like time is passing by read a slow  if you re intense im just flash by  in reality time is happening to all of us at the same pace the sales of time  he then it s minutes or hours or days in months or years that go by  the sales of time  anything that pycookol is naturally levidtotiv  anything that dicictacal  so i had a sentihuge or a scentituvefore a force which is always trying to go away and attendant from the sevbl  if you rivedngtdissentrthieenforceof time  we say you re biiore if you re qatar in the caclof time then that s being material if you re crushed by the cycles of time then may say or a suffering creature it is the same psycho either you can be crushed by the sac  all you can be trapped in the cycle all you can ride the cycle  to ride the ciconse of time  not to be trapped in it  definitely not to be crushed by it  time is crushing experience for a lot of people   anything psychlicol has this ability that it can crush you  or it can trap  or you can ride it and the yogic were looking at things we see time  time is efintoiscolor a be means both time and space  calominsdoness darkness means that which does not stop like  a top no  if there is light going by you wont see  only if it s stopped by something you see  so that which does not stop like is called do  so that which does not stop light esamti space  so both space and time or refer to as color  because they are not seen as two different entities only because there is time  space is possible  because that is time you can move from point a fine be so he is space  there was no time  no agama  the general perception is that because there is space that is time  but i dont see that way because there is time there is space no  that is time  which happens because of sacos the planet spins once it s a day the moon goes around the flat its a month the planet goes around the sun here we are  the scans of time or one dimension of time the another dimension of time  not which is  beyond a saclicalmature this we call as a great time its core the mahakala  that is time and there is greater time even in the or nocacoes the is time to where there is no siclicaf moment there is no physical happening thing that s physical in the inneres from what is atomic to what is cosmic  everything is said  that a locyco's happening no physical possible  when i said you you take a canyon  or should take the sentofsugal to ride away from the saccles of time  a bingsvirital and this one  that we know the sincols of time  because of physical reality  if we could measure  if i could show  what is the speed of an aletonabandepotdononnourtry we could give time tie  so much for us so we measured the planets how much time it takes to go around the sun they said it s a year  we went little further down to days and hours and minutes and seconds  all of them are cycles of the physical exists if there is no physical existence we would not know anything that sihligal if we did not know what is sactlia moment  would not no the saclical nature of the time  before existence manifested in its physical nature  there was time  this is god malcoman that is an eternal space  and not watching my words i m saying anletthimospace  when there was no woman  and everything was still  there was time  nothing cyclical happening that dimension of time into which everything dissolved  and fromitheverythingsprangdunthere when sairnanitytocsed it it took the sacifa moment  when sidelikamomenthapen physical haond then physical have in we could mesyountime otherwise time was just space  the word kala means both time and space so he we came for a party  and here you re going at us like this as if  it is important to know or rather  its important to touch and experience a dimension which is not titlico in nature because what is sachical is inevitably ravitative what is psaclicalinevitablevrunsittovidatdsomepla at some point he rancedsodon  anything that syclicle cannot be forever  because it needs a certain amount of kind of the energy which is going to expend itself  when a human being tuchetetentasshidammenshon ichisnotypelielymnature  so that is a new quality  quality which is beyond all qualities no  not bad this not that  temple like existence theres nothing i about  nothing about it  it's just that you move from the surface to the source not that it solves all your proves it's just that you wont know what is a problem  this i said something about the invious situation  this caurtosmakingraunds even reached the prime mister and he was laughing about it i said for every solution there is a problem  the sea but every solution somebody has a problem a cent  but people niting for every problem that is the solution  but then you don't see any problems when you see only solutions some people have problems of the solutions i don't know  what all i do  what i i do with myself  which is all and nothing at once what all i do it myself which is me and new at once it  problem or is tississaution that may be a space where the there no problems and no solutions just existence for cawileopobsotof nothing and pops out into nothing what is a

whether you re gone and passes the resolution or you pass the resolution it's not any different you re trying to achieve something by force anything that you ve tried to do by force feels like you re hanging upside down so being this but you want to do this  feel like you re hanging up sandawn  when you hang upside down  you feel like rebelling against it so naturally in three days your resolutions we become dissolutions otherwise you'll suffer hanging upside down  but if you ll suffer than to hear somebildisolvedisintl a sommonplea somminchleamonts but the very fact that they need one more resolution by the year end is a proof that they ve not did not last the year so that is no need to take any hisrutions but and the delusion is made because you want to do something that you naturally do not inclined towards symbol thing is are you inclined to be joyful or miserable you  that was only five people at a now  are you naturally inclined to be joyful or miserable a  to live ones a  so you can consciously  in a an attempt to be conscious  joyful is not my natural inclination  hodooyferlowliebeinginthe coming  just keep a count   lot of people who re doing business dethingthey'rkeempingaccounts only for the sake of i arise  not now  keep egouns not for the sake of irs  so if you do not get a comes  do not know whether you re making profit or loss  that s idea of accounts isnt  whether you knowing forward a backward  to know this you need an account book  to keep in a coma  at the end of the day just check  and my little more joyful today than it to be   if you have done the sensual fiveers of hate you would have been extent by now proffiteida  me like this pecodyouneicyptecont one day you checked when it became very acute  then you see are in a big loss every day  every month just keep accounts am i becoming more joyful and less joyful the only two things or sola  and how much joy do you give to people in a you  this you can keep or can  if you keep accounts of this people are keeping accounts of their money as if they want a car it with them the real wealth of life is how do for you  how wonderful is your experience of life  joy is not a goal by itself but it's a tesolyambinceforlieif  to seven this one ambiance whatever you have is just going waste   you may have helped that's going waste because there or more people on this planet or helding and miserable then on a hill he and miserable atlesifu  at least if you re unhealthy you got a good enough excuse for you  i   you are healiunmiserable that is not goose i wondered to just understand this it s just not smart to be miserable  this happen a lady was driving  and then she had a flat tire  she had never really  is tistcheneingtirebusiness but see that the in such a manual she put the jack and lifted up the car she undid the we with great difficulty she pulled out the heavy really from the boat and was trying to fix it nisfordonuxthanshe had she had kept it in the hub cap and without high she was struggling and she stepped on the hub cap and all eforenitflew in different directions so she put the new tire but she had no nuts   the and she was cursing and wondering and miserable what the hell to do now  and she was little more  because she was hearing all kinds of noises from a mental in  on which was across the street the  the law  as a young man looking out of the window watching this lady then he said  lady okay  one to do is take one one nut out of the tea  and put the greenupson this  bravlarghastationwith not to can drag no problem  she did that  and she got the car down on the road  she looked up at him and said you re so smart why do you hear  he said i may be nuts but i m not stupid a light to be little crazy and you dont have to be stupid on the so our smart people to be  like the practicing a posture for their grave  when i look at lot people  in a practicing  and they doing pretty well in a  i don t understand is it doesn't take practice when you die happens  yes  you to think in into practice  and i know  because you can amruneddattoiractise but you can improve life with practice he so  yes however you do life still do it better  is  but did happen so per efficiently for everybody you ll condemebrovonelant  gotinggoocanimproen  you don't have to practice your final porschan right now  if i come naturally believe me  it's not like is there no difficulty that i  come very naturally you will perfectly well in the grave  don't have to have an in down doesn't need any preparation  when you die we you get it   but now with life there is so much to do and more how much ever you do  there's something more to do about life isnt  if you want to be at it fundamental ambiance is that you re joyful  otherwise you will get this tremendously intelligent i do a question to be or not to be  it's indelictarly seems to any profound  but its a mutiyothequstion you ll on a have to decide not to  it will happen  there were many idiots like you countless number of idiots like you on this planet or gone  they don't have to worry about to be or not to be known  anyway they re not to me  this is a our time on this planet this  is our time on this planet  what are we going to do  i  are we going to make this into a nexilan full ndefulplanet are going to make this edoovisitable horribuplanint this is our time  free to do either way the choice is yours  i tell you  resolution that you would make this into wonderful planet  is no such thing the natural inclination of life is for pleasantness if you choose to be very glessentwithhen yourself pleasant things will happen  if you re feeling horrible within you you tried to do wonderful things then i want you to understand the worst tyrants on the planet those who to the very historically  i think of the worst of the lot  the e somebody like adatredlas on benintomoselininthe i really believe the going to queen to one of fuel world  no  they had to dream of an ideal world  when i horrible things going within you and you go at the world with very anegytill what you will create is a horrendous reality  before you touch the world  if you want to clean somebody s face you re a hands must be clean is a  or so   and not clean  do that this is not going to work  so before we react the outside world this much you must do to with your house that to you are gland  and you are pleasant have you to will become pleasant you are unpleasant  but you have good intentions it is no good i want to on this ten right now in the world one situation that is happening in certain parts of the world which almost everybody in the world  as the most horrible things that can happen they believe they re creating gods own kingdom the one so the  ounedvescentbelievfyouma question though intelligence you cannot question their integrity  as the wilingodiforit when a man is willing to die for something you cannot question his integrity is it  you can cushtionisintelligenttoandetiment but you cannot question his integrity because when i stake my life you must know i mean it isn't it i am not laingfolwithit it means small to me than my life  a certain yes  i wonder to know you have anger and hated going with a new but you want to create a wonderful world what happens the consequence of that is a horrindisrialitythesnop tension that the world we change it is by your consciousness that the world with chain how you are within yourself  if we don t fix this one thing  we will have intentions and intentions  the worse things how happened on the planet with good intentions bad intentions is  the most or a distinct how happen with very good indenious so what intention you have is not important what is your inner nature  this is important every action the human beings at doing in their life noinglyarunnoingly pusudoftherwolbeng  and you know you feel well only when you re joyful  hello yes you i really well only when you re happy and doyfulresante or in other words  a single action that human beings perform is in pursued of that happiness of joy  if they were joyful by their own nature  every action that you perform would become consc in s of being compulsive present  this is all you have to do to yourself  this year the coming year and the coming coming year and for the rest of you like you just have to keep accounts so at today a munlisemoretutful and i you don't even have to voyablegivingjoy or a joyful you widsbrejoy   will you keep a contermask  all i said i ours upon you  one enforcement most societies have been run for a long time by enfolcemate so there is nobody do and force  no that s not what happens if that is  nobody to enforce anything you ll become joyful atsympi i want you to understand this  their friends between a resolution and moving towards the natural inclination of life if there is nobody enforcing anything upon you do you become mesitafbleadoyful  so you don't have to enforce any this illusions upon yourself this little tools to make sure that you don't sink kipingourconts the  every day before you go to bed  check whether you re living more joyful today than yesterday okay if you keep this up the time you re thirty extent  when i was when i was just twenty five  i simply sat down with my close every cell in my body was dripping extasy namlessetecis then i trhelifedthisasact nothing to be done if you don t mess with your mind you re extent  the food at i was i made a plan  to and a half to three years time i am going to make the entire world extra  because theres nothing to do if you simply cant you know i dyvivyers  not lost it  a few people have gotten it  yes quite a four people have got men but still not the world  making some estimates  in an area in the last three as time we should be touching nearly hand of million people a year  but still that s not the world  and to do  dont enjoy my failure  i on the world is eemnpointtreblion people   no million is not a success it looks like in this time to die a fail  but i liealisfulfail i use may be blissful is not dependent upon the reslolts of my actions my  a rude in mablessulness this is how life needs to be conducted that your actions are rooted in your joyfulness and blissfulness that joy is not a result of something that you do the moment it is a visildof something that you do  it re fly away in no clams because our actions in the world  not always are they successful   how old well you do  the sun however well you do it  not always of a successful our actions so subject to waiousrealiti many forces have to come together for the success of any action  not always lever all together  so if you joy if your way of being is enslaved to the success of your activity then you being joyful is a very the more possibility  and over all i happening  when you perform actions if they don't succeed  so are going to become miserable to a couple of burns i will shine  and see how to restsecyore life to minimal activity so to do  enjoy maximum success if you coldpelyorsalafhonno if you cripple yourself you can put diepate in a race with people tap  you have only one leg  then you participate in a race with somebody who does not have both the length  a  this is what most people are trying to do  the moment there is fear of suffering fall  what you will do is comperyourseale restsicocour activity only an failure doesn't matter that you can go through your failure blissfully you will do everything that you can do who gives where the it happens had not  we willoidtenmildoitdwell  if it happens it s great if it doesn't happen it s very great because we can do it all over again  joy is not a consequence of flat or activity of life joy is a natural ambiance which is necessary if you have to to more morning if you have to wake up  and want to do something  you need to have some joy in you  the rise to the or not to be we had come or not  as you wake up and  tomorrow morning you vileftif joy nothing in  we wonder why am i here a son  day one twenty four hours completely joyless will you wonder what the i am i doing it  he or not  because this is the nature of life  if this life has to blossom  it needs the ambiance of joy so we have given you the tools to live or  you must keep a comes   yes  i got it  before they so food and music is ready and the party i do want takenimottime if theres a question that you can't go into the new without being answered  said a worship  not that you must ask a cursinyvthe sataoseokay  thats only you peak kitemsof   i have a thousands of barningquesions i i i thank you immensely for giving at this oppersiptidrussoneqishdon  how do i do ridervin some unconscious bad habits in my life  when he see that i have overcome some of those bad habits  see that it comes back again in my life  hagwaiterstordlygetrid of this and become  that a mustendestandandtois there is no such thing as good habit and bad habit habitarbaner habit means you re unconscious you think only bad headwitterundquantceus no  even the so called good habits it means you have learned to function in an oromatewiy in you do i do things consciously or exam  is brushing your teeth in the morning a good habit or a bad habit even you i thought you would be free from a habit  i had two ways of brushing your teeth  cause you ve been regimented to brush i  you get up and  or because you wake up you re vearysenidiv if you open your mouth conscious enough  most of the time  not conscious in of only  people know  is a very strange thing  it is the aparicos the old factory averytis which smell which have a sense of smell a right  about your mouth but you dont get it to the  getieivriedewin  that mentouteunconsciencicent is  if you re gone this you would still brush your  till you come to such a place when you open your mouth in the morning  molsslikefragantwtobecomelike a flower to happens you must justly brush  if you consciously brush on different they or different mornings it may ieddivferentlengh or different a man to rising  not every day brushing is same requedment but because you re regimented its im as were my tea out  if you were conscious on a particular day on brush as it is necessary for that day that s how it should be on a particular day you would eat as it is in a city for the body  sleep as it is a necessity for the body you would do everything consciously but now it's a habit everything is a habit  what time you should go to bed a time you shall wake up  you shall be to war you  not eat  everything by prescription  this is called slavery your doctor tells  all youuslamastertellsyouwhatyouthoneed to day i don't see what the difference was it the children or no this body needs today because no consciousness everything by regimentation  by habit  habit is at a dementationissint  it's only by a dementation you become havitu so in this for you are also identified something as good and something as bad habit or to do  he is there something called as bad unconsciousness and good and consciousness that s what you sing  when you say i have a good habit you re saying i m unconscious in a nice way last lakesigente saying i m dead in a nice way  because the fundamental difference between being alive and being dead is being conscious and being totally unconscious being partially unconscious is being partially dead as a ilorytolyou you re trying to practice the poshinchu and the state of what it means to be dead  do not tricks any kind of habit to see  to the idea of be drawing into eceets coming to this birds and space is just this you find space who had you can do everything consciously when you were in a race you could not be conscious you made you somehow fixed some habits through which you managed to wodreofdailyofficeroping when you come to a pitatoupace this is what you re supposed to do  that you watch what is the requirement of your body what is the requirement of your mind what is the equarment of her emotion what is the requirement of your energy or does this life need what does it naturally long for  to consciously watch this once you consciously know that this is what it is longing for then that is not always about it otherwise you think you are of this villagtofbatebecause  me that s a crime against me  if you re unconscious is a clam against yourself  but you re doing something that you think is ilritul because of me thats a climagansme  i do crime against yourself not against me so how do i get in of habits you don't have to get rid of habits it  like  what you re asking is how do i get rid of my unconsciousness you use the word un he is suggesting a non exist  not an existence isn't it consciousness ease when consciousness is not there  that is all unconsciousness how to get id of something that does not exist on  i am saying you re playing a trick with yourself  it's like  as this this all is dark  how to get rid of this does  no   all of you to me that i m sure you benkikot the docknass you get into an insane effort  one   this insane effort to get rid of unconsciousness no the richard of darkness you just have to lighted up  i would like it up  ducnesses gone because darkness is not an existence by itself  just the absence of light  similarly unconsciousness is not an existence of itself  it is just absence of consciousness if you become conscious do you have to fight with unconscious  if you re conscious you have to fight with unconscious habits  so you need to work on consciousness to become conscious or what should i do  you should not do unconscious things  because the essence of life is being conscious you know that you re alive only because you re reasonably conscious desenten yes or no yes yophastislep do you know you re dead or alive  do you know    why because you re not conscious when or not conscious do not even know whether you get at alive ascentit now you know that you re life because you re somewhat conscious now we just have to raise the wick a little bit to become more conscious that s what we working off  there are many things which has gathered in use  to a physical body thats why five thirty drum in the morning your mind has got into it on habityourdpacens that's why i mean to telling you with all this  oudenidies have followed the equerement of body mind they go into their own pagens that divide the sadhana the idea is to break the cycles of unconsciousness and become conscious when you become conscious it looks like you re in unknown team suddenly everything seems to be difficult when you re going habitolytolooklike everything was easy but see when i when i went into the climate or prison  and then inquarnford when i went there to conduct a program  almost twenty five twenty four twenty five years ago  i just obsoved this is something a whole lot of people are seeking in their life  persotlie because this is a place who have somebody always opens the door  and they close a to  the turn of the light for you they do everything for you  everdoanytreally for the comes a ban on time all  by the second amdelingof onmendfotereryg  think it s great in this prison  get place  thing is its an force  this is what a whole lot of people are seeking is  in that lie   when it is done to you you in hefelitdontelingu  when it when it is done to you you will suffer it  to leave but a whole lot of people prison life is far more it is far more othenisonwhattheycleam off in their life is far more efficient for mornotoshies and most of them are very fit an heal  but if you enter the prison  he is suffering in the air not once have been there hundreds of times a wariouspresens not one i stepped out of the prison without tears in my eyes because there is suffering in the air the pain in the air is unbearable because one thing that a human being suffers most is lack of freedom not lack of comfort not lack of wealth  not lack of this and that once freedom is taken away  human being suffers immensely  everything is gone prison life is far more comfortable than going to work and coming back  i stuck in the trafag going to all this problems you are a state guest and  really if you re looking for a comfortable no surprises kind of life  if you suffer every little thing everything shocks you  thing makes you got a stress intention and life is perfect  thing is in order  rises everything is just drag  the man us  nextsepenieswatcsthemanu there i posed by that in more nothing more nothing less one bean more means somebody will be taken to gas  thing is correct does we are looking for the core life  prison is the best place but a human being will suffer immensely when everything is correct  yes ted   thing is correct but no freedom people will suffer this immensely so you need to understand  habit means you have caused a little prison of your own and you and suffer the eftersuntime initially looks like efficiency after some time it is impresentmenti prison is in many is an epitomofveficciencyliit but efficiency not what this life is looking for this life is looking for expansion this life wants the freedom to expand always i was talking to one of this management species from america a very well on man  not mention the names  so he was sprubounding all his management principles of which look like a prison cell to me bringing order to everything  lusufficien so that the two ways of looking at this  that is a manicured garden which looks very parent is forest which looks like chaos but the manicagode if you don't managed for one man it's finished a nogatelefe forest has managed itself for a million is and and going on  it is more efficient which is more orderly a  forest is far more orderly and far more efficient but it is not fitting into your logical framework that a  this is what enlightenment means that from being a menicorgoden you become a forest because it sustains upon its house it doesn't need anything from outside in it to what of it nobody need to me  it nobody need to come and cement everything happens within a tall  is a   if you leave it for a million years it ll still be there  only if you meddle with it it may go away otherwise it in sustain its half because it is an efficiency of chaos we call something chaos not because it is inefficient we call something chaos because it doesn t fit in to our logical framework so habit means you have become a slave of your own logic and after some time the moment you fall a habit it is unconscious sent  so what you need to get rid of is not habits you have to become conscious if you become more conscious and you re not unconscious there is no such thing as habit you will do what it to you now  so nine

bokannadeoge i m to give it to the coblyganbythirdtamiy and so thats the book  a man you take with a  or okay  practice that is taught in the inner engineering program needs twenty an minutes need to sit in one place and do it  it is a fadifiennatiuren it is it is a process this can change to stop i  the chemistry of your system many of you have experienced this after a few months of practice if you look back and see all those little a thangsfith were so significant don't seem to bother you any  it s gone  simply because the chemistry has changed on know when camemistrychanges thinks change so  in order but where you have one  but there are other that mentions to human chenestry that instead of being olotilereactive chemistry become a very self contained chemistry which is pleasant and on  practices in the book are not  sitting down and doing practices you could be doing it anywhere i could be driving  you could be working in your office you  walking on the street and be doing it there  nature  in other words the practices in the book are just to bring a said in amount of consciousness the or did not have these practices to start with but when i travelled around in america  i was talking about being mindful then i saw  being mindful what they will do to themselves  and to work is to bring you to a certain sense of abandon that you can be here like you re not here  if you site  you don't even know whether your bodies  if you sit like this first thing is you don't have a gene you  a body is a very a  in a gene  if you simply sit like this that is not time for you  look of this only because you have a body you bodies keeping time  leo telling you how long you ve been sitting  no i i   i you had no legs you would have no sense of time if you had no back no sense of time at all if you had no body no time at all recently  bobiouskeeping time from on the to it is keeping time from batromrekdtobapomwikitiskeeping time from wakeup to sleep it is keeping time  no  one  time itll  you don't have to look at the water  once a certain time is up  but in a  the sun  right now you in that old timassineswithsand tookling away like that the bladder is keeping time  drop drop drop  fillsap  in time  legs are keeping the time  if you have done your practices regularly in to the pogramganknes  oabuokpraktesis if you d done the program pacissisregularely legs can desuve time no  i dont know what the famyurligsno i  bookaboprekise  so the program practices are of a different nature that cannot be transmitted unless a certain amount of preparation and it's a tantmission is not teaching book is a teaching  vagdifferencebetweenteaching and transmission do not mitmisunderstandbotas one  this is a was afcleading a smaller step for people  people are not willing to take one big step small step they leave the vogan if some small things change the take the program  but there is no substitute for sitting properly with us  and doing what is being done properly and not only that it is no substitute for a tensmision if something is not transtmated the new will happen  moment of the present will happen nothing new will have  which chambbiwiaenotlooking at him growing you we want something new to sprout in you  something that was never there with you till that moment must happen within you  and in the  is trying to tickirlydesist existing wherever you are right now to make a little improvent most people are looking for improvements in life they are not looking at transformation  transformation means nothing of the old should remain  that's gantlemation but mospevokglingdtothealler will you leave an  and on velecarried with you  can you  though it leaves you you will not leave it to to sexteenwillliveyou but you will not leave twenty sixteen isn't it  is to  you are a creature of memories  if you re agreadtol of memories  you are a creature of the past   that men you are a dynosi which is extinct  you become big because of your memories resi'tit but you re extinct  what is the use i not i was a big creature but doesn die what is the youlammasl this if you live in oumametdy you are being but what is the use what is needed is to reverberate with what is there now  it s good to handle the world  it s good only to handle the world it s no good to handle this one isn't it  and what i m saying  is good to handle the world around us the need to remember what are what happened with this person who  with that person  if that person what happened with that situation and this situation we to remember  gisirsoto ressed the world  but with your silly memory you  a atlestthisone it doesn't mean anything  this one you can address only with consciousness there is no other way  if you won't have this one you have assembly of things see let me her something where the sensitive wanted  listen to this carefully otherwise you ll come to wrong conclusions let  somebody where the the to goes and they go away for some brain you feel like you lost everything i had no you feel like you lost everything because you are making up a life of substitution where you are not there you fill it up with other people when they go away there is a  but that s not how life is happening because you are there only because you are there you can hold relationships with people isn't it hello  now in your experience you are not there  or a creature of memory  only remember this one and that one and that one you can't remember this one  how can you remember this one  because this is a cullentlife you cannot remember this one because you re handling everything by memory you will see when one volume of memory which was a certain person or a situation if that goes away if is like life has come to an end simply because  a certain amount of investment you ve made in a certain amount of memory you have about a specific person so if you live by memory i m saying twenty sixteen will leave you but you will not leave twenty sixteen if do leavesentweinty sixty how do you go to twenty seventeen you cannot you drag all this years and go into twenty seventeen theesn'no such thing he was be on a treadmill  exercise but you won go any way  that said me is fine the weathers bed  but it's not a we go to go somewhere  this mutomustunedhesspann memory is a teadna yes memory the tednalt it is all right to handle situations around  but you are not going to go anywhere with it  human beings have been mestive so much in their memory there s hardly a handful who will go with me on this one  i m asking how many of you really want to step into twenty seventeen fully leaving twenysixteen behind  i  if you re really if really really i m saying if you can leave the past as past completely if you can sit here just in the present past  you re enlightened  that hollitates it s the burden of the past which doesn't let you flower and your full possibility just the burden of the passion so this is a good moment this is not something that the planet is doing okay  the solsticshas just happened  is there  everdytdayplaniftisspinding evebeedthismoing in the tragic of the plaonetly moment around a sun you can choose any point to get a  you don't have to wait for this point to yes or no  and aerealeathispointntwhere some are in your mind you ve been told it is significant  it s only significant because there is a memory after into sixteen if that is no memidy of twenty sixteen in what way there is a dweintesheventeen it is no such thing now this is it  yconcusing us  sixteen sixteen thirty  to the midigagirectye  but only because there is memory  sixteen and there is seventeen isn't it   if you know how to simply sit here without being boded by omemety without being a product of memory when i say a product of me  you are like so this life whom you  whom you don t  is your friend who is your enemy  this comes because of your memory iscentet so and keep all that aside and let the year

particularly aneaviaut even internationally there will be a at a level of campaign  the fundamental idea is to use this iconic face as a gaonising force as i said the book is getting ready to use it as a galanizing force  or people  is a dangerous thing to say in tennessee do my people from religion to responsibility why i am saying the case humanity is become like this if small things go wrong in their life they will find one little guy to blame because of him if big things go wrong in their life they'll find a big guy  use of  what about this guy  and for  man in about fifteen to twenty years  almost all that they were which have been perininwhold become seasonal ovalitderisons  well for the last theersshabie working on this  we have come up with the kind of her a policy that the garment has to take up  we worked with a couple of state ganments which they are only trying to implement i managed to convince tichchifministirs and make this happen  recently put this across to the
