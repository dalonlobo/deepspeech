 the most beautiful thing about time is if you do something it passes by  if you do nothing it passes by  if you are joyful it passes by  if you are miserable it passes by  its absolutely just no matter who you are how you are for everyboy it passes at the same speed  only thing is our experience of the time could be different depending upon how intensely we live or how slack we are  if you re very slack with life it looks like time is passing by very slowly  if you re very intense  time just flies by but in reality time is happening to all of us at the same pace  these cycles of time whether it s minutes or hours or days or months or years that go by  these cycles of time anything that s cyclical is naturally repetitive but anything that is cyclical also has a centrifuge or a centrifugal force  a force which is always trying to go away at a tangent from the circle  if you ride this centrifugal force of time  we say you re spiritual  if you are caught up in the cycle of time then that s being material  if you re crushed by the cycles of time then we say you are a suffering creature  it is the same cycle  either you can be crushed by the cycle or you can trapped in the cycle or you can ride the cycle  to ride the cycles of time not to be trapped in it  definitely not to be crushed by it  time is crushing experience for a lot of people  hmm  yes  anything cyclical has this ability that it can crush you or it can trap you or you can ride it  in the yogic way of looking at things we see time time is referred to as kala  kala means both time and space  kala means darkness  darkness means that which does not stop light  you understand what i m saying  if there is light going by you won t see it  only if it s stopped by something you see it  so that which does not stop light is called darkness  so that which does not stop light is empty space  so both space and time are referred to as kala because they are not seen as two different entities  only because there is time  space is possible  because there is time you can move from point a to point b  so there is space  if there was no time  there was no way to move  the general perception is because there is space there is time but i don t see it that way  because there is time  there is space  now there is time which happens because of cycles  the planet spins once  it s a day  the moon goes around the planet  it s a month  the planet goes around the sun  here we are today   the cycles of time are one dimension of time  there s another dimension of time which is not which is beyond the cyclical nature  this we call as the great time  it s called the mahakala  there is time and there is greater time  even when there are no cycles there is time  but where there is no cyclical movement  there is no physical happening  everything that s physical in the universe from what is atomic to what is cosmic  everything is cyclical  if there are no cycles happening there is no physical possible  when i said  if you take a tangent or if you take the centrifugal to ride away from the cycles of time that means being spiritual  it s in this context that we know the cycles of time only because of physical reality  if we could measure if we could measure what is the speed of an electron around the proton and neutron  we could keep time  atomic time  but a bit too much for us so we measured the planets  how much time it takes to go around the sun they said it s a year  we went little further down to days and hours and minutes and seconds but all of them are cycles of the physical existence  if there is no physical existence  we would not know anything that s cyclical  if we did not know what is cyclical movement  we would not know the cyclical nature of the time but before existence manifested in its physical nature there was time  this is called mahakala  that is  an eternal space  you re not watching my words  i m saying an eternal space  when there was no movement  when everything was still  there was time  but nothing cyclical happening  that dimension of time into which everything dissolved  and from which everything sprang up  when certain energy touched it  it took to cyclical movement  when cyclical movement happened  physical happened  when physical happened  we could measure time  otherwise time was just space  so the word kala means both time and space   sadhguru we came for a party   and here you re going at us like this   is it  it is important to know or rather it s important to touch and experience a dimension which is not cyclical in nature  because what is cyclical is inevitably repetitive  what is cyclical inevitably runs itself out at some point  it runs itself down  anything that s cyclical cannot be forever because it needs a certain amount of kinetic energy which is going to expend itself  when a human being touches a dimension which is not cyclical in nature  suddenly there is a new quality  a quality which is beyond all qualities   not good  not bad  not this  not that  simply  like existence  there s nothing high about it  nothing low about it  it s just that you have moved from the surface to the source  not that it solves all your problems  it s just that you won t know what is a problem   this  i said something about the india situation and this quote is making rounds  even reached the prime minister and he was laughing about it  i said   for every solution there is a problem   just see   for every solution  somebody has a problem  isn t it   for  people may think for every problem there is a solution  but when you don t see any problems  when you see only solutions  some people have problems with the solutions   i don't know   what shall i do  what shall i do with myself which is all and nothing at once  what shall i do with myself which is me and you at once  what shall i do  is this a problem or is this a solution  there may be a space where there are no problems and no solutions  just existence  for someone who pops out of nothing and pops out into nothing  what is the problem and what is a solution  i m asking   hello  you popped up from nothing  you re gonna pop out into nothing  in this little space and time  what is the problem and what is the solution  i want you to figure this out   hello  what is the problem  hmm   there s really no problem  no solution actually but there are so many problems    sadhguru  we don t know where you are living   where i am living  there are so many problems   i am also living among the kind of people that you re living with   yes  same sort   the question is just what are you rooted into  if your rooting is just your physical body  some things are problems  some things are solutions  if you re rooted into a psychological framework  everything is a problem   if you re rooted into the existence  nothing is a problem  nothing is a solution  everything is an experience of life  hmm  everything is an experience   if i die tomorrow  that is also a very good experience  we don t wish it tomorrow but if it comes  that is also an experience  hmm  you don t like it  whether you like it or not  it happens  yes   yes   whether you like it or not  it happens  not that we re wishing it tomorrow  but if it happens tomorrow  what the hell   we don t want it tomorrow   still got miles to go before i sleep  miles to go before i sleep     we don t know how many miles you will go  but if you look at life in its full depth and dimension  life is a certain amount of space  if you look at life in a linear fashion  life is a certain amount of time  if you look at life from your psychological perspective  life is a certain number of problems  every day i m meeting all sorts of people  thousands of them  how many varieties of problems they have means it s unbelievable  for sure for every solution there is a problem   birth is a problem  death is a problem  in between series of problems  serial inventors of problems  one cycle is ending  a new year is coming  it s a choice that you have to make  are you going to invest your thought and emotion and energy in making up problems or making up solutions  or simply enjoying life for what it is  it s a choice that one has to make   oh  this is my resolution i won t make any more problems   to make resolutions  first you need a constitution  do you have a constitution  hello  you don t have a constitution  no  like a nation has a constitution  a religion has a constitution too  one advantage of the constitution of the nation is  we can amend it periodically  the constitution of the religions cannot be amended  it s fixed   any change means violence will happen   if you suggest an amendment  they will kill you  that is their amendment   the national constitution  constitutions which make nations  it is open to debate and amendment  i m asking you  you as a person  do you have a constitution  no  no  no  you have  what you like  what you don t like   this s what i will do  this s i won t do  i m a morning person  i m a evening person   i m a whatsapp person  i m a e mail person  i m a facebook person    there are constitutions   individual constitutions  maybe not written down  but it s there  isn t it  if you can pass a resolution  there must be a constitution  if there is no constitution  how do you pass a resolution about it  so there is  once you have a constitution  you are not a life  you are an institution  if you re living in an institution  you know what it means   it means you re a nutcase   yes  no  no  no  not everybody  either you re a nutcase or you re a spiritual aspirant   yes  you are a seeker of sanity or you re a seeker of liberation   one of these things means you live in a institution   so  what resolution should i take for the new year  all resolutions are impositions  where there is no consciousness  where there is no awareness to know life  from the from the aliveness of what it is  you wanna fix it  if you pass a resolution today  in some way you re making sure that you will not be aware for the next one year  because awareness means a spontaneous response to life  moment to moment  as a  resolution means fixed  pre fixed  if you pre fix your life  whether it s done by you or done by somebody else  if  if your government passes a resolution   all of you must hang upside down in india we would say a tamarind tree  here  where shall we hang you from  tch  what s the famous tree from which they hang people  no particular tree  hmm  where to find a oak tree    hmm  where to find a big oak tree to hang from  it s difficult to find them  in india we say a tamarind tree for a particular reason   so let s say your government passes a resolution that all of you must hang upside down from a tree  whatever tree   we ll give you the choice of the tree   will you suffer this  will you protest this  will you rebel against it or no  hmm   yes  yes  whether your government passes the resolution or you pass the resolution  it s not any different  you re trying to achieve something by force  anything that you try to do by force feels like you re hanging upside down  yes or no  you want to be like this but you want to do this  you will feel like you re hanging upside down  when you hang upside down  you will feel like rebelling against it  so naturally  within three days your resolutions will become dissolutions   otherwise you suffer hanging upside down  very few suffer the entire year  some will dissolve this in three days  some in three weeks  some in three months  but the very fact that they need one more resolution by the year end is a proof that did not  did not last the year  so there is no need to take any resolutions but a resolution is made because you want to do something that you naturally don t  not inclined towards  but the simple thing is  are you naturally inclined to be joyful or miserable   joyful   that was only five people   are you naturally inclined to be joyful or miserable   joyful   the little ones   joyful   so  you can consciously you can make an attempt to be conscious that joyful is my natural inclination  so how joyful will i be in the coming year  just keep accounts  hmm  see  lot of people who re doing business  they think they re keeping accounts only for the sake of irs   no  no  you keep accounts not for the sake of irs  because if you do not keep accounts  you do not know whether you re making profit or loss  that s the idea of accounts  isn t it  whether you re moving forward or backward  to know this  you need an account book  why don t you keep an account book  at the end of the day  just check   am i little more joyful today than yesterday  tch  if you had done this since you were five years of age  you would have been ecstatic by now  profit side   became like this because you never kept accounts  one day you checked when it became very acute  then you see you are in a big loss   every day  every month  just keep accounts   am i becoming more joyful or less joyful  there re only two things  how joyful are you and how much joy do you give to people around you  this you can keep accounts  hmm  if you keep accounts of this  people are keeping accounts of their money  as if they re gonna carry it with them  the real wealth of life is how joyful you are  how wonderful is your experience of life  joy is not a goal by itself but it s a necessary ambiance for life  if you don t set this one ambiance  then whatever you have is just going waste  hmm  you may have health  that s going waste  because  there are more people on this planet who re healthy and miserable than unhealthy and miserable  at least if you re at least if you re unhealthy  you got a good enough excuse for your misery  hmm  you re healthy and miserable  there is no excuse  i want you to just understand this  it s just not smart to be miserable   hmm  this happened a lady was driving  tch and then she had a flat tire  she had never really done this   this changing tire business but she read the instruction manual  she put the jack and lifted up the car  she undid the wheel  with great difficulty she pulled out the heavy wheel from the boot and was trying to fix it and these four nuts that she had  she had kept it in the hub cap and with her high heels she was struggling and she stepped on the hub cap and all the four nuts flew in different directions  so she put the new tire  but she had no nuts  tch  then she was cursing and wondering and miserable  what the hell to do now  and she was little nervous because she was hearing all kinds of noises from a mental institution which was across the street   then on the third floor  there was a young man looking out of the window  watching this lady  then he said   hey lady  look here  all you need to do is  take one one nut out of the three wheels and put the three nuts on this  you can drive to the gas station  with three nuts you can drive  no problem  she did that  and she got the car down on the road  then she looked up at him and said   you re so smart  why are you here   he said   i may be nuts but i m not stupid    it s all right to be little crazy  but you don t have to be stupid  all the so called smart people who ve become   like they re practicing a posture for their grave   you know  when i look at lot of people  i think they re practicing   they re doing pretty well   but what they don t understand is  it doesn t take practice  when you die  it happens   yes   yes   do you think you need to practice  no   because you can t improve death with practice but you can improve life with practice  yes or no   yes   however you do life  you can still do it better  yes   yes   but death happens super efficiently for everybody  you can t improve upon that  you think you can improve  no  you don t have to practice your final posture right now   it ll come naturally  believe me  it s not like life  there re no difficulties there  it ll come very naturally  you will do perfectly well in the grave   you don t have to have any doubt  it doesn t need any preparation  when you die  you will get it  hmm  but now with life  there is so much to do and more  how much ever you do  there s something more to do about life  isn t it  if you want to be at it  the fundamental ambiance is that you re joyful  otherwise  you will get this tremendously intelligent idiotic question    to be or not to be    yes  intellectually seems very profound  but it s the most idiotic question  you don t have to decide not to be  it will happen  there were many idiots like you  countless number of idiots like you on this planet who re gone  they don t have to worry about to be or not to be now  anyway they re not to be  this is our time on this planet  yes   yes   this is our time on this planet  what are we going to do  that s the question  are we going to make this into an exuberant  joyful  wonderful planet  or we going to make this into a miserable  horrible planet  this is our time  we are free to do either way  the choice is yours  i won t tell you   take a resolution that you will make this into a wonderful planet  there is no such thing  the natural inclination of life is for pleasantness  if you choose to be very pleasant within yourself  pleasant things will happen  if you re feeling horrible within you  and you try to do wonderful things  then  i want you to understand   the worst tyrants on the planet  those who topped the baddie list historically i ll pick up the worst of the lot  you take somebody like adolf hitler or benito mussolini  they really believed they are going to create a wonderful world  you know this  they had a dream of an ideal world  when you have horrible things going within you and you go at the world with very energetically  what you will create is a horrendous reality  before you touch the world  if you want to clean somebody s face  your hands must be clean  isn t it  yes or no   yes   your hands are not clean  you try to touch this   this s not gonna work  so before you touch the outside world  this much you must do to with yourself that you are pleasant  when you are pleasant  whatever you touch will become pleasant  you are unpleasant  but you have good intentions  it is no good  i want you to understand  right now in the world  one situation that is happening in certain parts of the world  which almost everybody in the world sees as the most horrible things that can happen  they believe they re creating god s own kingdom  yes or no   yes   they one hundred percent believe  you may question their intelligence  you cannot question their integrity because they re willing to die for it  when a man is willing to die for something  you cannot question his integrity  isn t it  you can question his intelligence and judgment  but you cannot question his integrity because when i stake my life  you must know i mean it   isn t it  i m not playing fool with it  it means more to me than my life  yes or no   yes   i want you to know  you have anger and hatred going within you but you want to create a wonderful world   what happens  the consequence of that is a horrendous reality  it s not by intention that the world will change  it is by your consciousness that the world will change  how you are within yourself  if we don t fix this one thing  we will have intentions and intentions  the worst things have happened on the planet with good intentions  not with bad intentions  yes or no   yes   the most horrendous things have happened with very good intentions  so what intention you have is not important  what is your inner nature  this is important  every action that humanbeings are doing in their life knowingly or unknowingly is in pursuit of their well being  and you know you feel well only when you are joyful hello yes  you feel really well only when you are joyful isn't it  or in other words  every single action that human beings perform is in pursuit of their happiness or joy  if they were joyful by their own nature  every action that you perform would become conscious instead of being compulsive  isn t it  this is all you have to do to yourself  this year  the coming year  and the coming  coming year and for the rest of your life  you just have to keep accounts  from yesterday to today  am i little more joyful  am i  you don t even have to worry about giving joy  if you re joyful  you will spread joy  yes  will you keep accounts  i m asking   yes  or shall i set irs upon you   do you need enforcement   most societies have been run for a long time by enforcement  so if there s nobody to enforce    no  that s not what happens  if there is nobody to enforce anything  you become joyful  isn t it   i want you to understand this   the different between a resolution and moving towards the natural inclination of life  if there is nobody enforcing anything upon you  do you become miserable or joyful   joyful   so  you don t have to enforce any resolutions upon yourself  just little tools to make sure that you don t sink  just keeping accounts  daily  every day before you go to bed  you must check whether you re little more joyful today than yesterday  okay  if you keep this up  by the time you re thirty  you will be ecstatic   when i was   when i was just twenty five  tch  i simply sat down with my eyes closed  every cell in my body was dripping ecstasy  nameless ecstasies  then i realized this is it  nothing to be done  if you don t mess with your mind  you re ecstatic  the fool that i was  i made a plan   in two and a half to three years  time  i m going to make the entire world ecstatic because there s nothing to do  if you simply sit here   you know  thirty five years    i have not lost it  a few people have gotten it  yes  quite a few people have gotten it  but still not the world   making some estimates and  on an average  in the last three years  time we should be touching nearly hundred million people a year  but still that s not the world   no  no  no don t  don t  don t enjoy my failures   my idea of the world is 7 3 billion people  tch hundred million is not a success  it looks like i m destined to die a failure but i ll die a blissful failure because me being blissful is not dependent upon the results of my actions   my actions are rooted in my blissfulness  this is how life needs to be conducted  that your actions are rooted in your joyfulness and blissfulness  that joy is not a result of something that you do  the moment it is a result of something that you do  it will fly away in no time because our actions in the world  not always are they successful  hmm  however well you do it  yes or no  however well you do it  not always are they successful  our actions are subject to various realities  many forces have to come together for the success of any action  not always they will fall together  so if your joy  if your way of being is enslaved to the success of your activity  then you being joyful is a very remote possibility  and above all  what will happen is  when you perform actions  if they don t succeed  if you re going to become miserable after a couple of burns  then you will shrink  you will see how to restrict your life to minimal activity so that you will enjoy maximum success  if you cripple yourself  you know  if you cripple yourself  you can participate in a race with people  suppose you have only one leg  then you participate in a race with somebody who does not have both the legs and of course you win  this is what most people are trying to do  the moment there is fear of suffering  of failure  what you will do is cripple yourself  restrict your activity  only when failure doesn t matter  that you can go through your failure blissfully  you will do everything that you can do  who cares whether it happens or not  we will do it and we ll do it well  if it happens  it s great  if it doesn t happen  it s very great because we can do it all over again   joy is not a consequence of life or activity of life  joy is a natural ambiance which is necessary if you have to  tomorrow morning if you have to wake up and want to do something  you no  you need to have some joy in you   otherwise  to be or not to be    will it come or not  suppose you wake up and you  tomorrow morning you re bereft of joy  nothing in you  you ll wonder   why am i here  yes or no  one day  one twenty four hours completely joyless  will you wonder   what the hell i m doing here  yes or no   yes   because this is the nature of life  if this life has to blossom  it needs the ambiance of joy  so  we have given you the tools  to live joyfully  you must keep accounts  hmm   yes    yes   i got it   before they serve food and music is ready and the party is ready  i don t want to take any more time  if there is a question that you can't go into the new year without being answered  if there is such a question   okay  not that you must ask a question  if there is such a question  okay  no  it works only if you speak    namaskaram sadhguru   mhmm    i have thousands of burning questions  but i thank you immensely for giving me this opportunity to ask one question  how do i get rid of some unconscious bad habits in my life  when i see that i have overcome some of those bad habits  i see that it comes back again in my life  how do i just totally get rid of this and become free out of it  see  you must understand that  please there is no such thing as good habit and bad habit  all habits are bad   because habit means you re unconscious  you think only bad habits are unconscious  no  even the so called good habits  habit means you have learned to function in an automated way  that means you don t do things consciously  for example  is brushing your teeth in the morning a good habit or a bad habit   even you  i thought you would be free from a habit   there are two ways of brushing your teeth  because you ve been regimented to brush your teeth  you get up and ffff   or because you wake up  you re very sensitive  if you open your mouth  you re conscious enough  most of the time  you re not conscious enough  only other people know   this is a very strange thing  there is the apparatus  the olfactory apparatus  which smell  which have a sense of smell  right here   above your mouth   but you don t get it  others get it five feet away   that means you re unconscious  isn't it  yes   yes   if you re conscious you would still brush your teeth  till you come to such a place  when you open your mouth in the morning it smells like fragrance  you become like a flower  till that happens  you must consciously brush   if you consciously brush  on different days or different mornings it may need different length or different amount of brushing  not every day  brushing is same requirement  but because you re regimented   three minutes  i must wear my teeth out   if you were conscious  on a particular day you would brush as it is necessary for that day  that s how it should be  on a particular day  you would eat as it is necessary for the body  you would sleep as it is necessary for the body  you would do everything consciously  but now  it's a habit  everything is a habit  what time you should go to bed  what time you should wake up  what you should eat  what you should not eat   everything by prescription  this is called slavery  your doctor tells you or your slave master tells you what you should eat today  i don t see what's the difference  why is it that you do not know what this body needs today  because no consciousness  everything by regimentation  by habit  habit is regimentation  isn't it  it's only by regimentation you become habitual  so in this  you have also identified something as good habit and something as bad habit  what to do  is there something called as bad unconsciousness and good unconsciousness  that s what you re saying  when you say   i have a good habit  you re saying   i m unconscious in a nice way    it's like   saying   i m dead in a nice way    because the fundamental difference between being alive and being dead is being conscious and being totally unconscious  being partially unconscious is being partially dead  as i earlier told you  you re trying to practice the posture  and the state of what it means to be dead  do not fix any kind of habit  just see see  the idea of withdrawing into retreats  coming to a spiritual space is just this   to find space where you can do everything consciously  when you were in a race  you could not be conscious  you got mad and you somehow fixed some habits through which you managed to go through your daily office routine  when you come to a spiritual space  this is what you re supposed to do   that you watch what is the requirement of your body  what is the requirement of your mind  what is the requirement of your emotion  what is the requirement of your energy  what does this life  need  what does it naturally long for  to consciously watch this  once you consciously know that this is what it is longing for  then there is no two ways about it  otherwise  you think you re on the spiritual path because of me  that s a crime against me   yes   if you re unconscious  it s a crime against yourself  but you re doing something that you think is spiritual because of me  that s a crime against me  tch  you better do crime against yourself  not against me   so  how do i get rid of habits  you don t have to get rid of habits  it is like what you re asking is   how do i get rid of my unconsciousness  when you use the word  un  we are suggesting a non existence  not an existence  isn't it  consciousness is  when consciousness is not there  that is called un consciousness  how to get rid of something that does not exist  i m saying you re playing a trick with yourself  it's like  suppose this  this hall is dark  how to get rid of this darkness  kick it out  hmm  all of you together  i m sure you can kick out of the darkness  you will get into an insane effort  you ve been on it  hmm  this insane effort to get rid of unconsciousness  no  to get rid of darkness  you just have to light it up  if you light it up  darkness is gone because darkness is not an existence by itself  it's just the absence of light  similarly  unconsciousness is not an existence of itself  it is just absence of consciousness  if you become conscious  do you have to fight with unconscious  hmm  if you re conscious  do you have to fight with unconscious habits   no   no  so you need to work on consciousness  to become conscious   oh  what should i do  you should not do unconscious things   because the essence of life is being conscious  you know that you re alive only because you re reasonably conscious  isn't it  yes or no   yes   you re fast asleep  do you know you re dead or alive  do you know   no   no  why  because you re not conscious  when you re not conscious  you do not even know whether you re dead or alive  isn't it  now you know that you re alive because you re somewhat conscious  now  we just have to raise the wick a little bit to become more conscious  that s what we re working on  there are many things  which has gathered inertia  your physical body 30 drum in the morning  your mind has got into its own habitual patterns that s why me torturing you with all this  your energies have followed the requirement of body and mind and they ve gotten into their own patterns   that is why the sadhana  the idea is to break the cycles of unconsciousness and become conscious  when you become conscious  it looks like you re in unknown terrain  suddenly everything seems to be difficult  when you were going habitually  it looked like everything was easy but see  when i  when i went into the coimbatore prison no  i went there unqualified  you know   when i went there to conduct a program   almost twenty five  twenty four  twenty five years ago  i just observed   this is something a whole lot of people are seeking in their life  prison life  because this is a place where somebody always opens the doors for you and they close it for you  they turn off the lights for you  they do everything for you  you don t have to do anything   really  food comes bang on time   always  by the second  i m telling you  tun means food is ready  everything is great in this prison  i thought this is a great place  only thing is it's enforced  but this is what a whole lot of people are seeking systems in their life  yes  when it is done to you  you will suffer it  i m telling you   when it is done to you  you ll suffer it  actually  for a whole lot of people  prison life is far more it is far more organized  what they dream of in their life  it's far more efficient  far more nutritious  and most of them are very fit and healthy  but if you enter the prison  there is suffering in the air  not once   i have been there hundreds of times to various prisons   not once have i stepped out of the prison without tears in my eyes because there is suffering in the air  the pain in the air is unbearable  because one thing that a human being suffers most is lack of freedom   not lack of comfort  not lack of wealth  not lack of this and that  once freedom is taken away  a human being suffers immensely  everything is correct  prison life is far more comfortable than going to work and coming back  getting stuck in the traffic  going through all these problems  you are a state guest  you know   really  if you re looking for a comfortable  no surprises kind of life  if you suffer every little thing  sh everything shocks you  everything makes you go through stress and tension  prison life is perfect   everything is in order  no surprises  everything is just right  even the menu is written down   next seven days  what's the menu  it's there and it goes by that  nothing more  nothing more  nothing less  one bean more means somebody will be taken to task   everything is correct  those who are looking for a correct life  prison is the best place   but a human being will suffer immensely when everything is correct  yes or no   yes   everything is correct but no freedom   people will suffer this immensely  so  you need to understand  habit means you have caused a little prison of your own and you will suffer this after some time  initially  it looks like efficiency  after some time  it is imprisonment  prison is in many ways an epitome of efficiency  isn't it  but efficiency is not what this life  is looking for  this life  is looking for expansion  this life  wants the freedom to expand  always  i was talking to one of this management specialists from america  a very well known man   let me not mention the names  so  he was propounding all his management principles  which if which looked like a prison cell to me   bringing order to everything  so that it's efficient  see  there are two ways of looking at this  there is a manicured garden  which looks very perfect  there is forest  which looks like chaos  but the manicured garden  if you don t manage it for one month  it s finished  there s no garden left  a forest has managed itself for a million years and still going on  which is more efficient  which is more orderly   forest   forest is far more orderly and far more efficient  but it is not fitting into your logical framework  that s all  this is what enlightenment means  that from being a manicured garden  you become a forest because it sustains upon itself  it doesn t need anything from outside  nobody need to water it  nobody need to manure it  nobody need to come and trim it  everything happens within itself  yes or no   yes   if you leave it for a million years it ll still be there  only if you meddle with it  it may go away  otherwise  it will sustain itself because it is an efficiency of chaos  we call something chaos not because it is inefficient  we call something chaos because it doesn t fit in to our logical framework  so habit means you have become a slave of your own logic and after some time the moment you form a habit  it is unconscious  isn't it  so  what you need to get rid of is not habits  you have to become conscious  if you become more conscious and you re not unconscious  then there is no such thing as habit  you will do what's right for you now  so  nine hundred and ninety nine questions  please live with it for 2017   all the best   namaskaram sadhguru  thank you so much for this opportunity  i have a question regarding the book and i wanted to know like if we read the book as i ve read it and i m doing the practices  the practices in the book  how do they help versus the programs that we have and if someone s reading the book and doing the practices  is that enough or what is that they need to do next    hey  what did i do to deserve this  hmm  hmm  what s your name   shashi   thank you    oh  oh  oh ho ho ho ho   isn t it a bit too early for flowers   thank you   these are slippers for the airplane   oh  i must wear them on the airplane  i usually don t walk  i fly   thank you   thank you very much  thank you very much    can i please say a poem   hmm   can i please say a poem   i m sorry   can i please say a poem   oh yes please  microphone please   there s a poem they re going to recite   my heart is like a singing bird whose nest is in a watered shoe  my heart is like an apple tree  whose boughs are bound by thick sap fruit  my heart is like a rainbow show that paddles in the sea  my heart is gladder than all these because my love has come to me  raise me days of silk and down  covered in peacocks and doves and pea  pomegranates and peacocks with one hundred eyes  work it in gold and silver grapes and leaves and silver firty  because the birthday of my life has come  my love has come to me     what a sweet poem    i m sorry   you know  we re washed away by  we lost the question  you know   okay  okay  practices  practices    if only  if i get to do that  that would be amazing    i m sorry   that was lovely  the kids getting to hug you  it was amazing    hmm  what is that   the kids getting to hug you was amazing  you know  so it s okay   but you don t have a sweet poem like her   oh  when you said the book  you know i m supposed to finish this book before 3rd of january  so i m working on that book  when you said   the book    i was just thinking book  book  book because this book is bothering me for last few days  i m supposed to complete it by 3rd january   we re writing a book on adiyogi  i m to give it to the publisher by 3rd january and  so that s the book on my mind  you re talking about the old book   old book  okay   the practice that is taught in the inner engineering program needs twenty one minutes  you need to sit in one place and do it  it is of a different nature  it is  it is a process which can change  to start with  the chemistry of your system  many of you have experienced this  after a few months of practice  if you look back and see  all those little little things which were so significant don t seem to bother you anymore  they re just gone  simply because the chemistry has changed  you know when chemistry changes  things change   in whatever way you have known it  but there are other dimensions to human chemistry that instead of being a volatile reactive chemistry  can become a very self contained chemistry which is pleasant and on  the practices in the book are not sitting down and doing practices  you could be doing it anywhere  you could be driving  you could be working in your office  you could be walking on the street and still be doing it  they re of that nature  or in other words  the practices in the book are just to bring a certain amount of consciousness  the book did not have these practices to start with  but when i travelled around in america  everybody was talking about being mindful   then i saw  by being mindful what they will do to themselves  my entire work is to bring you to a certain sense of abandon that you can be here like you re not here  if you sit here  you don t even know whether your body is here  if you sit like this  first thing is you don t have a gender  you don t even have a body  so where is the question of a gender  if you simply sit like this  there is no time for you  just look at this  only because you have a body  your body is keeping time  hmm  your legs are telling you how long you ve been sitting  yes or no   hmm   yes   suppose you had no legs  you would have no sense of time  if you had no back  no sense of time at all  if you had no body  no time at all  isn t it  your body is keeping time from womb to tomb it is keeping time  from bathroom break to bathroom break it is keeping time  from wakeup to sleep it is keeping time  yes or no   yes   once it s time  it ll do aaaaa   you don t have to look at the watch  once a certain time is up  your body will do aaaaa  yes or no  right now  you ve seen that old time machines with sand trickling away  like that the bladder is keeping time   drop  drop  drop  as it fills up  you know what s the time  legs are keeping the time  if you d done your practices regularly  i mean the  tch the program practices  not the book practices  if you d done the program practices regularly  your legs can deceive time  you  your legs don t know what s the time  your legs know   book  book practice   so  the program practices are of a different nature that cannot be transmitted unless a certain amount of preparation and  it s a transmission  it s not a teaching  book is a teaching  there is a big difference between teaching and transmission  do not misunderstand both as one  this is a way of creating a smaller step for people  because people are not willing to take one big step  one small step  they read the book and if some small things change  they may take the program  but there is no substitute for sitting properly with eyes closed and doing what is being done properly and not only that  there is no substitute for a transmission  if something is not transmitted  nothing new till happen  improvement of the present will happen  nothing new will happen  with shambhavi we are not looking at improving you  we want something new to sprout in you  something that was never there with you till that moment must happen within you  that s the intent  the book is trying to decorate the existing  whatever you are right now  to make a little improvement  most people are looking for improvements in life  they are not looking for transformation  transformation means nothing of the old should remain  that s transformation  but most people cling to the old  will you leave 2016 or will you carry it with you  hmm  can you  though it leaves you  you will not leave it   2016 will leave you  but you will not leave 2016  isn t it   yes   because you are a creature of memories  if you are a creature of memories  you are a creature of the past  hmm  that means you are a dinosaur which is extinct   you ve become big because of your memories  isn t it  but you re extinct  tch  what is the use  dinosaur was a big creature  but doesn t exist  what is the use i m asking  like this if you live in your memory  you are big  but what is the use  what is needed is to reverberate with what is there now  memory is good to handle the world  it s good only to handle the world  it s no good to handle this one   isn t it  do you understand what i m saying  memory is good to handle the world around us  we need to remember what happened   what happened with this person  what happened with that person  what happened with that situation and this situation  we need to remember  it is useful to address the world  but with your silly memory  you cannot address this one  it doesn t mean anything  this one you can address only with consciousness  there is no other way  otherwise you won t have this one  you have assembly of things  see  let me address something very sensitive  i want you to listen to this carefully otherwise you ll come to wrong conclusions  let s say somebody very dear to you dies  or they go away for some reason  you feel like you lost everything  yes or no  you feel like you lost everything because you are making up a life of substitution  where you are not there  you filled it up with other people  when they go away  there is vacuum  but that s not how life is happening  because you are there  only because you are there  you can hold relationships with people  isn t it  hello   yes   but now in your experience you are not there  because you are a creature of memory  you can only remember this one and that one and that one  you can t remember this one  how can you remember this one  because this is a current life  you cannot remember this one  because you re handling everything by memory  you will see when one volume of memory which was a certain person or a situation  if that goes away  it feels like life has come to an end  simply because a certain amount of investment you ve made in a certain amount of memory you have about a specific person  so if you live by memory  i m saying 2016 will leave you but you will not leave 2016  if you don t leave 2016  how do you go to 2017  you cannot  you drag all these years and go into 2017  there s no such thing  you will be on a treadmill  you ll get the exercise but you won t go anywhere  treadmill is fine if the weather is bad   but it s not a vehicle to go somewhere  this much you must understand  memory is a treadmill  yes  memory is a treadmill  it is all right to handle situations around us but you re not going to go anywhere with it  but human beings have invested so much in their memory  there s hardly a handful who will go with me on this one  tch  i m asking  how many of you really want to step into 2017  fully  leaving 2016 behind   yeah  yes   whoa  whoa  whoa   if you really  if really  really i m saying  if you can leave the past as past  completely  if you can sit here just in the present  no past  you re enlightened  you know  that s all it takes  it s the burden of the past which doesn t let you flower into a full possibility  just the burden of the past  so this is a good moment  this is not something that the planet is doing  okay  tch  yes the solstice has just happened  that is there  but every day planet is spinning  every day it is moving  in the trajectory of the planetary movement around the sun you can choose any point to get enlightened  you don t have to wait for this point   yes or no  but anyway we are at this point where somewhere in your mind you ve been told it is significant  it s only significant because there is a memory of 2016  if there is no memory of 2016  in what way there is a 2017  there is no such thing  no  no  this is  sadhguru  you re confusing us   sixteen  sixteen  seventeen   it s correct  arithmetically correct  yes  but only because there is memory  there is sixteen and there is seventeen  isn t it   yes   so if you know how to simply sit here without being burdened by your memory  without being a product of memory  when i say product of memory   your likes  your dislikes whom you love  whom you don t love  who is your friend  who is your enemy  all this comes because of your memory  isn t it  if you can keep all that aside and let the new year blossom  you will blossom into a wonderful creature  spraying fragrance into the world  well  there won t be any attendant music nor will there be an applause  but if really beautiful things happen who cares whether it is appreciated by somebody  or not   hey  where is the attendant music  what happened to the musicians   come on  nothing so wonderful happened  so let s have some music   what   what is this  what did you say   isha home school   i have no such mission  it s for the parents to decide where they want to send their children  hmm   so what do you want to do with them  eh    oh  you re thinking of starting a school here   yes  yes  so many children  look at that one    she is a missionary  i m not   anyway  just to tell you a few things  one thing is  on february twenty fourth is a once in a lifetime kind of event for isha that we re unveiling this hundred and twelve feet tall face of adiyogi in coimbatore in the isha yoga center in india  it s going to be a massive campaign  particularly in india but even internationally there will be a certain level of campaign  the fundamental idea is to use this iconic face as a galvanizing force   as i said the book is getting ready   to use it as a galvanizing force to move people   it s a dangerous thing to say in tennessee   to move people from religion to responsibility  why i m saying this is   humanity has become like this  if small things go wrong in their life  they will find one little guy to blame     because of him  if big things go wrong in their life  they ll find that big guy     because of him  what about this guy   some of the studies show that on an average all indian rivers are depleting by eight percent per year  that means in about fifteen to twenty years  almost all the rivers which have been perennial will become seasonal for variety of reasons  so for the last three years i ve been working on this and we ve come up with a kind of a  a policy that the government has to take up  we ve worked with a couple of state governments which they re already trying to implement  i ve managed to convince two chief ministers and make this happen  i ve recently put this across to the prime minister and he s agreed to this in principle  but to raise this awareness across the country because most people are unaware of it completely  so  and also it s been a long time since i drove across the country  so  we re driving from leh ladakh which is the ta  northernmost tip of india to kanyakumari and back on the east coast and back to delhi  totally about 12 000 kilometers  about sixteen major events will happen on the way  so those of you who can drive in india  because it takes a different level of skill  if you wish to be a part of that  we will do this rally of a certain number of people  some can ride on a electric bus  rest can drive  there ll be probably two or four electric busses and maybe twenty five to fifty cars  in each segment  lot more will join but this complete trip will be approximately twenty five cars and two busses probably  it ll be finalized later but there will be major events in all the cities to raise the awareness about the rivers in india  so we want to involve the entire population in the cities  there ll be rivers you know river related quizzes for the children  people will run for the rivers  people will cycle for the rivers  people will do all kinds of things for rivers on that day when the event comes to that city  and above all to make a policy document and when we come back to delhi  we re having a conference where we present this along with the chief ministers of many states we re going to sign a river accord as to what the policy should be about rivers  even now  different states are fighting with each other for river waters  not realizing that in another fifteen twenty years  there may be nothing to fight about   yes  it s a serious situation  so this is going to happen  if some of you wish to participate in this  it s going to be an incredible experience of driving across the length and breadth of india  which is by any standards the most colorful nation on the planet   chaotic  but colorful    it should take about twenty five days  anywhere between twenty to twenty five days  i think   hmm  i m sorry      about the school   especially in      she s gonna do it anyway  so  i m not against it but i m not for it either   i m definitely not against it but i know what it takes to run a good school  it s not about buildings  getting the right people with long term commitment to well being of children who may not be theirs but when you have children who are not yours  you have to do much more than what you would do with yours  i need people like that who are willing to do a lot more with somebody else s children than they would do with their own  if there are such people  a school will come together anyway   if you live by this silly standard of what is yours and what is not yours  anyway you will live in a very small space on this planet and in this cosmos  if you have no sense of what is yours and what is not yours  everything will be open to you  that s my blessing to you   let the entire cosmos be yours  why are you stingy  why are you even stingy in your greediness  at least in your greed be boundless  hmm  i m not saying generosity  i m saying greed  at least in your greed  let there be no limit  that you want everything to be yours   that s greed  ultimate  that s my blessing   may you become greedy in a limitless way   why are you stingy even on your greed  eh 
stupid   please
