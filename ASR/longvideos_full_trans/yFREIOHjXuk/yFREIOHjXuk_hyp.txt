i am free to claim the mantle of being a good role  i think it s a deal  now a fuegoodstoden  i was told and will not look for a good girl because if you re a good student you learn from have  you not looking for a good good  even if you meet a very bad one you would learn a lot from that how you should not me  a pot   in a way is what happened to me my own a game i looked i met so many people who

posaltintheiouphis they get so thirsty they got to find it because if you show them something  not yet in their experience the only choice that somebody has is either to believe what you say  see it is  if you believe you do not get any closer to reality if you disbelieve you will not get any closer to reality it is just that if you believe me you will have a positive story to tell if you disbelieve me  have a negative story to tell  you will not be an inch closer to reality of all i think putting people into this kind of a dilemma either to believe or disbelieve what when i say or do i think it s a see  should not put people into such a situation so my work is many you are a see but not in dentinh so my work is to make you so intense that it cannot be denied to  because short is not hiding you are hiding from it it is not it  to idolmiseverybereanlyunous you are a living from it because the intensity of seeking has not happened if seeking becomes intense enough knowing is not far away because what you re seeking is not sitting on mount everest  then you  so how long does it take what is within you if it takes a lifetime of course you re on a con job isn't it so  it was sitting on mount  you could not climb that s understandable maybe you don't have the legs and the land to get to the top of the mountain but what is within you if youd on fine obviously you re on a

oseleelyvitchman a one hastednyoculencyisaligema so  and you see the man the orcanecythas one  but  see unfortunately we have brought the world to a place where the words like rich or wealth have become purely economic descriptions there was a time when people would talk about wealth of knowledge or well wisdom that's  to a you say well they people will only understand it as an economic well  because in many ways today society is driven by economics there was a time but of when we were only influenced by the  is atlyswiwoldiscastheweder of course i am bored  nothing much to discuss but today all qonveationsottaratdoteconomy everyone in the world everybody is behaving like an economist is as  so it is a cononic engine which is driving people s minds it is the economic engine with  determining the nature of choices that we make in the world it is economic opportunities we to determine  what kind of education people go through people are not studying what they want to know people are studying that which will fetch them the maximum money   so maybe a few are still a mating for love everything has become economic in ematedsfates a whole lot of people before made they'resanningupontract in cavesmetdeuers what's the deal how can two people become one when this calculation is on the even the idea becoming one has been given up is always do  the idea and the dream of two people becoming one has been completely given up because when economic calculation comes  become exclusive  inclusive so the conotiseerulindus in every way so wenoaseverich when you say well  we re only talking about money  just richness and wealth if you say he s a big man in the town it doesn't mean that he has a big brain it doesn't mean that he has a big heart means he has a big pocket nothing else this is a very poor way to exist when we do this  ladies must not as  then i cannot mics become the main cracks of everything that we do the feminine will vanish from the world or feminine will be subjugated if women have to succeed have to become like men that is not a way masculine will be everything  means word would become i do late there ll be no as the  beelwenotbeauty there ll be no gentleness everything will be a canlvolation what is you  what is not you  i got what   there would be no  there will be only a marketplace evrovet in the market place  s of the market place out like this if i give less and take more that masamsmut yes  if you buy you would the sheremarketyoubuyforless and sell it for more is smart  lorsneworoklike that life becomes beautiful only when youre willing to give it all  you don't care what you get unfortunately economics means an organized approach to survive now we may survive  when we are in the cave said ive was a big issue we organized civilization with so much effort because we that if we could leave a  and unfopussanhigherdiaminsiens of life but once again we brought out with those dooplce at bringing our is your place where survivellysupleme nothing else matters now only thing is we have raised a lot of survival and set away that it doesn't matter what you have still trying to their life everennatues and the world tlesronantryswere almost evlytittean as everything that is me  this still fighting for so i  fighting for said i would like nobody else  i keep asking the main people  at all the time talking about freedom was streedeminyourlife because even if the most significant dimension appears in your life you can take a turn i keep joking with them you know some time ago two thousand years  jesus came and said come follow me a few people followed him but today if you desascomesibaccansiyscomeforlofme where can you follow  the diferyourmartiga on your house you have dilesgohtenlonadaytofortyfive you have a lot on you have in  you have this you and it got to follow you  banktogotom you in a word to follow  think it doesn't matter you when you would be minenidtyadive you cannot can the direction of your life this is not freedom free means you should be able to change and alter your life according to the ovirunitissthatcopisint  if something truly significant comes you should be able to turn around and do something else because we have an sryndiconomicsas the histvellue all this things are gone everything is about money and well to means just money again to the wealth that we have today in the world is just made of in peoples miles  in two thousand eight when esition was setting in the western countries i happen to be egoltidthe economic for  at that year india was running a campaign in to to land the campaign was  everywhere all the american and european business leaders with all looking very depressed because  resisionwasscoming that means they had a few billion dollars less than what they had  and they were all very depressed  presence  at to an angry with everything indian people were rubbing it in their face i get down into the land ogeholdingsintheaevitova buses in the  inside the plan indiawhatewav so it was iditating everybody so they asked me to handle session glad the or the ecession and depression i had the system is bad enough  so is is worse  if you have always been complaining you don t have enough free time this is the time to walk on the beach what are you ellaningamo what is it that we are come lining about so there was a time irocrat we we have strucoftheconomicenddinhissuc  like that tuhplentidpetheastory where a monkey sitting on the wrong end of the branch hoping the ranch if it succeeds it will fall that hawearewritnow  i said see we have stuctodiceaseif  see we all all that's how we are right now because fail you will be depressed if we succeed the world will with damn  yes the way i  so i said it s better  rest because if your ambitions of fulfill to be not planet left  that were a go so this chinese biogradid a wonderful thing he  the big manner  put one chair and  i see the a twochers entderhealoncetedintamidle belttedyas then he powered up the middle  see now there s only one chair the pie then he said always there was only one chair you made it up with the mirlerthedeewaregorcher the well and the planet is not gone anywhere it is just distaruding itself a little bit every time it slips out of your hands and goes to somebody you would get depressed he was saying its more into china the  having the chaos  a hero  so  thankiverymucwasalydoyers  no and the other place question comes in my mind so  education the children the the sloofnarwaeonindohercountry like it  it education all his feel he more and like to education there has to be a right kind of it is because educating seiticare is a bat  is not a it  right kind of educations is more important  i i feel and i say  we lack the whole process of education for the so many years  i can try an eighty years but we  not wimliviitheintllectionefforfdilawe we face it  the india is not intellect it is lomicallyfor india is intellectually poor at the moment because he has been a big gap of the holy processors education the light end of educations to aloitete what s your take on it  say a indias not definitely not poor on intellect i would say you are one  then no factor all kinds of people around the world business leaders  exciive  till i would say savemisignolins not a random if you pick up and the people from the street just like that either in mumbai or cannial a law i would say they are way smarter then most be full that you can picgopanyreyein the world i  and you shouldn't late for yourself  i should have left out on by  it is just that we do not have an organization for this intellect to find expression because there is no nesscity structures to find expression each person operates this is one thing about  everybody thinks he s a genius these  and you will see everybody the nexportan everything it's like so to a local pishap he will tell how with a pole strokes or not perfect how he should do like this like that  he will fair how and that in the mother does not know or fraministor we should be we face every than it that s mealdtemigeasmoli he knows everything in the world but it is just that we can i would be one livylawunot and everything else is an exact  this as a little erissuin the country this mainly because it is no outlet for the thennormousintelicthatcontryass there is no structures for people to find expression to that you would just see  in in people and put them anywhere this is a atoups a virus it's not about surviving i i  because once they find proper structures and they understand the structure you can t stop them  us bidiannecsarly intellect this is a consequence of a very huge history a contiehisory that we have today there at experiments to show like for example if you are  to say you put the smell of this flower on a foot  ten and keep id in front of a rat or a mass and when i mosenpedtosit if he got an elitatihap if you do this a four times next seven enalicious those of out of a notgordowards at  all of them understand this is their learning so similarly within the human being a lot of was done in the past  i weecallisomdscatlarthat is intrinsic learning are  still paying off  other words we still said living on oardfood it is time that this generation gets the right stuff but that s not happened yet because our education system and every system that we had has been descufedradly in a systematic  because we have been an occupied nation for nearly a tausendirs  some came and just ravaged everything others came and systematically destroyed everything and icleated an education system which has many the word obedience and cletial kind of work  her majesty sovic in nintid forty seven when we got our independent we should have seriously thought about what kind of education does india need we must understand this without any infiscep  silly without infostrecture without any kind of education our farmers are using food for one point two five million people  this is knowledge why is this not knowledge i must  is not knowledge with  not competence i i was talking to a group of  so is this telling them i ll give you ten acres of very forttielamp to anti  a couple of tutdifeentcrops  ticotdthehartlessletmissi loyolembiandbearwhateer you take out a crop lignisse it ll freak the hell out of you and i  not it i personally found i know what it is it is the more educated you are in a more difficult it becomes  early cousitthouyontamse close sense of envolvment  what youre doing and from this  loving the land to the seed to taking the crop out it is not a easy process but our farmer suggest doing i like that  if it s just part of their life something that bigustinheadited this is a nation with or twelhilandews of egocuteles only land like that on the planet in sutderanindia they re farming the same land for ordwillalebius that a saidondercorsvicholdess so there is no lintleceissanvidious levers but we have tried to push everything is  and re in and the we once again we want to learn a b  and not like  so there is a disruption in the interenceiflarning that we  and the school learning that is coming to us i m saying this lead  ohoverweleducated you may be leadaboocand make one good somebadlitnissin it wont come he sexeclyquestionisebecus we are thinking only what is written in the book amplesvecuelcyisonlynol is not making a wonderful sambar no  why is not growing up craponoly why is not making a pot knowledge we have very constipated sense of what is knowledge asiccos the school system because this is a come from else  some indian student in oxford  is a  in a month  we sephiwas speaking adopsofordunion in obsordunersity  of the indian students has filed her a or petition that he should be compensated for the boring

feel why not be interlel and lattermentothesshee so the broblemies  we are talking about like to edupacionis we have for example i dont of the exact number i follow the country in  or i  we have ninefornsixmilyentildreninthegonwent school on  or a nine one six million children  when you have such washed numbers then you have to do something what you do for the mass is never the obese but what  you have to nut everybody so sun rudimently sense of education is happening because at least them as learn who you should do no this seventy aigtesthe objective was everybody from now how to write them name i can be was liplesimminsyou must know how to write or  this is all that is they were trying to move them smtameteimprinttosomethinglitim it did not change life in any way but it was a

no school in forstucto but there was no elite everybody could read and write i do everybody  so they wondered how does this happen then they realized the system is so organic that it is simply happening from within so the first thing that decided was we must destroy this education system because if you idtocatedthem like this  they would become english the amdenlindin left in this hall  this system of education that we have inheaditad from those who occupied this is so we must understand it you never take advice from your enemy i should  if you have some sense an  and the

the isagaroieplicity to us  question which bothers me at times  about the worcollddemocrac what is democracy and what should be the relationship between the leaders and the people the gormenttandtepeate and in glingdoldumocrac full orgesicotapfrust the leader of the people this likecus so the intemeney the word for democracy is dennenik that means people are the leaders the thensforetetino here and there are no people people of the leaders atswhatdeocrismians unfortunately people have forgotten that they are thelidis i hear even  waningeoverhiscaviliaiveningavasbeinginterviu to the morning i was being interviudby a goernalistinlecno so said this politicians that are no politicians  fall from the sky he just you and me body who was willing to do the dirty job for you what you think is dirty and you don t want you yourself or your tillenstogetin somebody got into it to you  yes  once you get there then i gave me such that you just do is your hands you can help  it s become let her the system so in democracy there is no leader and people it s people and people but obviouslytheearleadetheorepeopletothet seclewheaveellouneditothei every five years you could stand up  omlitathathowithouldbe  havenotkiptedmoremabonoermevilenough because  and this tendency of giving a responsibility to somebody and  i i  when something goes wrong we will clean otherwise we don't get a down and it is a a  if you  making a movie  every running a business not after something goes wrong yulatentodasiadecter you are on it every moment to see it goes  is  saying  you live in a democracy  must be an active ticipent it is not a spect at to spot to sit back and forget about it and then crieindsometinggoesrong i am telling you even your home will not run  if you don't be an of  and forget about the nation the sun you and your home your own family will become car  if you re not being attention to many things so  to  but it's true with a is if you dont pay constant attention  your whole well bad and a  so when this is the thing that  i nation if everybody doesn't pay attention to what needs to happen on we go back then we cry we have this problem when small things to wrong we have somebody here when big  go wrong we have somebody there this guy is free free he is never responsible but anything this has to change  what we  the most beautiful thing about democracy is poor can she hands without blodfuing and now were befortytappernanyemanistory whenever power changes blood was  now for an shift from one  for people to other  without bluodsfilling which is a huge atuement are as individual need to an destanddat i am the part of the opricia  coldaeponsble as my leaders  think one mistake we have done it in our education systems in our  there is no awareness about this that there are instruments in a democratic process  which olifiscanparticipateinsulthway on a daybiseusihouwish this as this awareness has not been brought to people they think if they cast who one antenos because one eliiondtelmission then they alexander the enter go one they will miss  they were old and they think theyre very responsible to die  the woldironecenteneous  how it works you need an active participation then only democracy will work the way it has to work right now i would idea of leadashippeast if we find a good leader we will start worshipping them a good leader does not need wish what a leader  if somebodies a competent lythere comes at the top what he needs  he needs many leaves of lee  shi so that he will find traction to what he is is to do but you will see a good leader  even spin on the spot because there is not deton own the line either that onwissepingpeople and those war with even their own stuff so we need to understand democracy means we have taken the nation into our  we need to make it happen somebody we die somebody will make all  somebody will take some decisions but the nation is run by the people  i don't get it then i ll always be just complaining we will not have a great nation if we want a great nation we have to stand up and take charge of this country tickingchide of the country does not  sipping power to modowmorniy no we are what roles we have to play we should be doing our best  are always talking about politicians are being cut up but i m asking you if there is no policeman on the street how many people will stop at the red light i think about ten or  a beingtonedasanol about ten percent is if you elect any one of them as a chief minister or the prime inistovoiotingtherwigo  cueloebricuseney i see you know normally i land in virmetorlivintanight  then i love levenoflockwonenoteowarterwhichime and i m driving from the apple the light i stop the whenlivingdeviousmofpedgaywho'sbucke i i i i  then i got idontvotilleegenli comsecomesanextomensislike this  what wrong with you  i see things i am a fool all right i think   elilytige  and what are you doing here  oh  so if you make this people in  if you put these people into positions of power what people or impositions of power or on spotlight everything that they do is seen but corruption is all away is it  within the house being a goltiled and a boy there is a distinction  so  being a life hand and life  onissepritioneisinfideos  so corrupssonis not just up there digging money or whatever corruption is on all levels sntitthere is not evenhandedness about life we have brought this to everything this has to go  ttititwoprocessis needed if i can say something i think i must have shared already a lived stettulflrssassissamport because an inclusiveness is needed you must staneen looking at things as sopelitandin i on iireonislow you learn to look at everything this is one thing that happened to me really early i realized i don't know anything so that it being attention to just about inytg one thing i discovered with people around me was they would be open  now they would be a tension only to those things that they thought is important rest of it the land ignot i wouldnt know this i won't decide what is important i found the ant crawling on my on the floor was far more important to me  we then my father who is god asking me to do something at the  i m say  i was  so are you a child old isn't it so  you tie looking at the end you do not  i doesdenortingtheandhismoeimportantthanyouatthatmommen yes it does because it s more interesting than you it is it is the finest face of mechanics that we can find on the planet if you would willynotamabeglikeana we i would just go any at a one so i got into this mode of paying attention to just about anything because i ve never occur to me something is more in for  and something is less important my father believed that he s a very a he s a disciplinarian so he thought so evening seven o clock the lano'crok in the evening me and my siblings must say something pextablk and he will be sitting there reading some magazine on us  is so that we study i am noisesaboo that efijust open my  i just open somweck i never had  even today i dont have the  i open somewhere if i need one bath i know the author s mind thrown  i dont read be on that so i open somewhere and on the page i find a small speck of something i know some fly in the fish  if i just look at it it held my attention and tirewhogiwas i was like this looking at this work i never had a sing a work no i a look up anyway i just got a sovringtothisliton  there was enough in that little spot to keep me engaged for two hours why i m saying this is this is the biggest mistake we re making with life we are setting this up in aurtillden'ssminds this is  this is devil this is a  this is in it  this is my not mine  this you pasincorruptionyou  in corruption to the infant to recognize one thing as high one thing as low in as my one thing as not mine scolopthinistarted if you make this time that you brought him up like this into  mister of course he will be put up whatever if you  getting into a position of responsibility and power it only gets magnifi somebody doesn't just get cut up the moment to get there in cure all their life trandincorption by the  and undeplosit now it got magnified because the opportunity is magnified  so corruption is not up there corruption is everybret if you are cencentofbourcorruption just sit at home and see how many things are there in your life which you need to iron out yheirsuvnel  if you don't take yourself you have no right to complain about corruption the case coldaftenit in your own  and is in your mind colrptonisallaroundyou it is just that those who are full in positions of power you expect them to be clean i also do  i dont believe that will happen unless down the line or so can we aspire for that in our life because the kind of people we are that s the kind of ludasreelyctd isn't it  we have some aspiration to change it but to be are not determined to change it something that is negative something that is rotting in a society will not go away and less wipdetermantpetentd  strong dedemination de  otherwise it will just go  brought is not something that you can simply get rid of because of our scridedboitself it is plenliless it is which doesnt spreadabytelf you have to do the in but rot sfretcedbyitsetfh so coruptinsfrtsbatfel if you want to bring lenyeeugh you have to strive first to fall bringing it into your life otherwise it's not one of work i only talk about it  or you re a master of knowledge and a street matelogierityng  i feel that i m a child of entielindewre and they know india tousandiaswag indian hundred years back and in empty  so with this how they looked to get up how i have changed how i have changed from tosanttohundedtto be and why i have changed i said of letters or need to be better what is the change you ask  was a change and in him how much we have changed when we talk about india thousand means we re talking about recent times and ressemttprise dolsnheniceafo soentifiepovis so a indiazaculterexisferordtwovedfiftenthousandyears at one time we became a nation with enormous  elecanormouscapabliy see i crucible of science mathematics astronomy the godisitisindthe world have acknowledged modern science could not have taken a single step without the mathematic that came from india so there were tremendous minds that we ewoulke because we had what is called as semscity so here we have a sane good to school which is on this life same scoodymeans some means equenimus and exiviat clettheminswarefordoing it that is getting life to a place where it is ejivlent and equenimiuce  to keep you alive exivilent and equanimous now this life will be fufligh life this is the aspolition of every life where the it is a odwone out a word or a tree all of them are aspiring to become full fledged life so is a human being only thing is we know what is a fuoflishortoan we know what is a footheflichbord we know what is a fotfletdree but we do not know what is a foflithemanbeng no matter what you become  you feel it's not enough  doesn't matter what you have become in somebody else s eyes you might have become big but within now you know this is not enough because what is human is a limitless possible expansion because for every other creature nature has set its between these two lines they live and die but a human being is  arnlindes no opline so most human beings are suffering their freedom if you are suffering your bondage understandable but if you re sufhingyourfreedomlhat'shabenting but that s what is happening human problem is what to do it myself whatever you do it s not enough whatever you do it s not enough if you had come like any andercreature you seterivaltakehencareoff everything is fine with you isn't it eingslevpingtheproducanivit as you were fulfrint a late that is not letting with you  with these things are in qurstonther  once they happen they re nothing so this sasition what you talking about historical moment of a human beings in this country there was a time when we hit a peak  it became so absorbed in finer aspects of life what that we did not have fighting men our biggest strength was  are placed in a jograph incrusible where we were well fordictiv we call this hindestongue not after a religion as people think it is today or some people think it s after a language no a land which lies within him a less and the indesiheraoftheiniemochanthissis hindlet why we wishiftistogeographicandfeachures  we knew our well being comes from these two features the himalenrengus and the indian ocean perfectuea so we could focus on the development of the human being when every other society was constantly ravaged by etenoforces we remained untouched for a long fit of time but when people came they did not come as in water  the just came in few  hundred two hundred people they were actually bandits they wanted to lay loot and run but then they found  was sold to side people would deeply in all in spirituality the man  me  as one  somebody who s looking at the stars can fit so one who singing music cannot fight somebody was to you know counting  or doing mathematics cannot fight they found this was such an easy land badly became amberos the state there on  tabackwhy  is they decided to stay back and they became emperors and these are not people with any hadminisative skills they will be very  so they do that way so im mensivelinghappe but we had an evolved sense of intellect and philosophy and ideal  see through which we so  he doesn't matter how you beat them he didn t fight back but they survived the  i survive they kept their  he kept of some site  the tradition whatevertextepttewouldandsurvivandsadevivenstarlape after a what a thousand years of invasions and all kinds of rooms or at us still this is the only culture on the planet which still has a flavor of its imidenessoritince everybody else is totally wiped up but today it has not been easy he does not been the best of times what was the greatest economic power on the planet just to the anotyasifvol oh we became one of the poorest nations in a matter of tarntiftetotre  adinkotabouttoonmanseaventoyears we became the poorest  because everything was shipped out but still we re coming back once again we have an intellect we need a determined leadership to wake us up a little bit  i ll sleepy on  because for generations ten fifteen gennity our mothers have taught us never confront a problem on the street you you see a problem come home yes  what our matdershavdoughter because this is the mentality of an occupied nation dont raise your head  and come home  so raise your head you may lose it but if we want to teneaytpledes n the nation  a people who seek problems and contranproblems on a daily basis  maendewsikandcontrndtoprovlem half the nation luzus it doesn't matter what's the problem see everybody was talking about black money all right it was one of the conositions always going on so when they dont have money  if somebody else has black money the money that i have is white what you have must be black  this is me the mynfic this like when you try to take some action just look at the voices all over is it the best aconisittherongaco to the point we can vibitedendless but the thing is it is some action in the virgtion we talk about senseditthese i said a boseslith and i wonder since my ted  that in my home and other places also a allwistrinewhendisgenticsaswemontwar we get married the montlazaonhinsesput or the viendestandtanunot you re not shippas to understand on that that is what i was told and  i i find monthtosandandits all species  on what a adocesiois and we respect somewhere make the back of a aminoflispectalalng and chilplingwitsasity  it comes to a we give us to live sescics we to the  unless langwagwic gives you a drowl i will not give you a job and we already she a alonthemtothansuseet why it is so  this is as i said have experienced ten well almost fifteen generations of abject poverty so when we in set a state of fat  our only concern is of a tilintredsomehowsaivive somehow get one degree get a job this used to be the month of a sixpiecsand seventieth get a gun and job somehow is i ll become a dog that s the best thing your life is made somebodyels get sick but your life is made this is coming from a certain fear that your children may not survive if they don t pass this this this examination the man up on the street as it all often that were the  not offosfeare if you were to a child did not get it  unless was superdpelanted with something most loblyhewillenduppasitryfum that was effect but slowly things have changed of old economic situation has changed dramatically we want to recognize it had not in seventies how you were living and how you are living today there is a phenomenon different in the mail well so today our children have many more options viccons little go slow on this job horingtevedication still there is a large segment of india istilasteallthatway but  those who are reasonably well  and roliosslowtetildren i cleadithreedifferent dimensience of education one is a  ucasionwithjesqualislisoveddear to bring a  to this to morrowreaegolingaddwelling them to bring a ratirterluellegeipaie this education is designed purely to get this  out of their economic and so she picked that in this is the age of six they re learning english language within one year they become fluent in english language and the gut working on the computers this english language and computer is their passport out of the village this is the goal this is one in a certain way we have another school golisahoms this is for the affluent this is an in a completely different  an enormous inclusion of sport art theater i cant  see every kind of thing that you can actuishthaddetrort the scholitselhisclearedinovearyistheticway so the children experience a different dymenen of life and these children live in groups of twenty in a household with a dedicated couple who peres with his children for the first five years and the next five years they ll have another set of parents  you defend house this chillangrewp with enormous exportureto all kinds of calos but example now i am made the lever than well which is to into the  i said in hours hoodidsteheus because we have inlestedsimac on music art dance ted all this thing the moment they come to leminstand many peensogoldmorksmad so danlymartmoxtamoxkse they want to drop the music  up every other art the like so i said the  so exterdhismone whatever they are older they will become much more proficient in that if their good mositions they will going to that the goldantertothenlgoingtoautvir using them to ledasifmanagiment business that i dive things you were childrenlyget out of the school one enle i think you can afford it because you re well  you have only one child or maybe two children it's all right your child gets to work one earlier  or feculokay i ll everybody thought it  now everybody wants to be there another dimigen of education here there is no forbalitication there are only six things that they learn they start with yoga caloripydto which is the mother of all martial  classical  classical  in god  and i  which is all this that  first for years this six cibtec after four years they will drop any room of them and he did for  and after another to an a half the three as  the ruptomor and the next five years or six  the i do only to subject the will become expert in that you must come and see this children you won t believe how they are  there incredible because this is focused towards being the human  and the human brain to its fullest  if you want something to perform first thing is you must build a machine you must be a my in to a higher level of capability then onladygpurfolm right now the biggest problem with that the modern worties we toobolorientedm we want to enhance our activity without enhancing who we are this is why everybody is talking about the  what the simple jobs they re doing this fressful because they re inahandoto activity without anenting themselves it's like a takulrmytheatenendotherrestrack for a back  is not good for that answer its okay to bad your office if you re a it it ll break  so similarly if you want to an and your activity you don't woraablttactivity if you enhance the human being hevilperformedthactimity according to his cibibiity so this is focused on just developing the human being these children are in another zone altogether friends  i  he wont believe  i must tell you this the first out i was vinitidthimabout five years i

stalecostolison let's on the standirsonthati'econtext the word shiva she we means that which is not that it is is physical creation that it is not is that it is not physical that it is not a can it be and in dieaomat or on this planet or in  lesevercaned  its evrywrak there is a diamondsgonlifs existence shall requallyapproperitely she what that means that which is not to their modensietico saying that nearly in ninety nine percent of the costmasusis empty but not that it is nothing there is something but it is not something because i would idea of something is we should be able to precede twoughfivecensus now what can see and what you cannot see is this you can see my hand because it is stopping like in  in that is not stopping life you dont see isnt  now that is air here which you re reading which is wasted white from your forlyrigx but you dont see you don't see the air unless you live in all that s a privilege of being in the capital city now if you look up in the sky use the stars but startstadta small happening the real thing is the vast emptiness should this weheffordtoas she r that which is not to de modenscincusso saying this  space has a tremendous amount of energy but it is not any of the energies that are measurable by us like  cdromagmnetickarwave are we yupian the are strong opera  or electrical systems a microwave none of these things it is none of the vresutableenirtis but there is no denying it is tremendously powerful  so we said said this she we means that which is not and we said it is in the lap of shiva that creation happens at the same time we call adiyogi also the shiva because he perceived that which is not you are who you are  we call you a ditecherofvilimbodusadwhy because you would see something  i did not perceive that they will not recunnaseyousthat so we recognize ardeugias  because he pusseevedthatwich is not because you perceived that we called him also she  then maybe there any number of people  listen suternlintheal ninety percent of the men a named after shiva  or that mannolsoshiver because we know if he does the right thing he can also realize that he is so  we named our dog altosule yes because we know he is also made of the same stuff but he does not know but we must remind him by naming him so  we call the go was to two is you were no problem in another country in another  religion they would be very insulted if you named your dog by their gardsname  you will see in the willies dog only in the cities they have this problem all their dogs have engusnings is because this fetdogbusiness came to english people  a dogs were there on the street and we never thought that of taking dogs and fondling them like this only the english were doing it because they were away from him homand they must  been feeling lonely  as the is  you see in india  if so for many less family all the of having listening  so weve called a ultimatlyaletyesheva the one who realized that  you ve s  one who did not realize that but has the possibility colimsiva we pondopdogaldseshie because he is also made of the same stuff but he cannot know but we want him to hear that so so everdyanrecollimsiashivushu we hope
