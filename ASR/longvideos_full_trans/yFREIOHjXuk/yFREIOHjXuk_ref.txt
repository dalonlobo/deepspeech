sadhguru chants sanskrit chant jananam sukhadam  namaskaram  namaskaram to everyone   my hearty thanks to you and your team for giving this one of the most honored opportunity  to be with you and to listen to you  since i have been a seeker since my childhood and that is what made me a writer  a storywriter and that s what made me screenwriter and that s what made me a filmmaker  where i observe people  the traditions  the values and changing people  i experience them because since time my childhood  i ve been living with them  and whenever i met people  i felt them  i observed them and i could see the changing people from every decade to decade  in 1940s  the values of our society and the values today have been so much different  i remember if i talk about cinema or film   because i m a film director  so pardon my expression through cinema only    in 1940  there was a film called padosi  where they showed this story of two neighbors  and one neighbor found the other neighbor in trouble  his wife was sick  wanted some medicine  doctor  this first neighbor went to a dentist and asked him to pluck his golden teeth  he sold to the jeweler  brought the money and gave it to the neighbors for the treatment of his wife  then in fifties  the films came  when the friends versus friends would the sacrifice for the life  they would save each other  film like sangam  then sixties came  when there are family relations were explored in human drama  the indian families  and the seventies came  when the violence erupted  when the rich man looked like a thief and dishonest man  and the poor man cried and amitabh bachchan was born   and then eighties  somehow mr  rajesh khanna  with his romance pacified us  and so the cinema went on changing the values  our hero  heroines  from radha  ganga to gayatri  they became katrina  kareena  and so many names now  so cinema is the reflection of society  sadhguruji  so we pick up the stories from them but there is always a question of mind  i do connect gurus  mentor like you  from time to time  to send some social matters to talk something about my subjects  so  here i say  sri sadhguruji  you are a guru  i am a student   you are a spiritual guide  i m a drama writer and a director  you answer so many question  sadhguru  but i question every answer  as a child  i talk and write about conflicts  you talk and write about the redemptions  the solutions  you look at the people as a victim of ignorance  i look the people of actors of the world  i complicate their thoughts with various dimensions  you resolve their thoughts with one dimension by becoming gps  our gps   i do not know  guruji  about the finite to infinite  i do not know the measurable to immeasurable  for me  beginning is birth  end is death and rest is the journey  jo mila voh mila  jo nahin mila uska kya gila   i do not know a no man s land  a distance from a subconscious to conscious  as said by some  one of our writer  i m a student  as you were once over also a student  so  now you are master  a mentor  i would like to know sir  what is a good student and what is the good guru or a mentor  how would you define a really good student  bad student  good guru  bad guru    you have already claimed the mantle of being a good student   so i think i am free to claim the mantle of being a good guru   i think it s a deal   now  for a good student  a good student will not look for a good guru because  if you re a good student  you learn from everything  you re not looking for a good guru  even if you meet a very bad one  you will learn a lot from that  how you should not be  that is also important    yes   in a way  this is what happened to me  when my longing came  i looked  i met so many people  who claimed to be gurus  but the only thing i learnt from them was how a guru should not be   and that s not  that s not a small thing to learn   yes  it s a very big thing   it s a very big thing   like  as a director  i always tell my technician what not to do  i never tell them what to do    so  for a good student  there is no problem  wherever he goes  he will learn  whatever he meets  he will learn  a good guru is one  who doesn t teach you anything but makes you so thirsty  you can t help learning  if people come to me thirsty  i don t give them water  i put salt in their mouth   they get so thirsty  they got to find it  because if you show them something which is not yet in their experience  the only choice that somebody has is either to believe what you say or disbelieve what you say  if you believe  you do not get any closer to reality  if you disbelieve  you will not get any closer to reality  it is just that if you believe me  you will have a positive story to tell  if you disbelieve me  you will have a negative story to tell  but you will not be an inch closer to reality  above all  i think putting people into this kind of a dilemma  either to believe or disbelieve whatever i say or do  i think it s obscene  you should not put people into such a situation  so  my work is mainly  you are a seeker but not intense enough  so  my work is to make you so intense that it cannot be denied to you  because truth is not hiding  you are hiding from it  truth is not hiding  truth is obvious everywhere in the universe  you are hiding from it because the intensity of seeking has not happened  if seeking becomes intense enough  knowing is not far away because what you re seeking is not sitting on mount everest  it s within you  so how long does it take  what is within you  if it takes a lifetime  of course you re on a con job  isn t it   yes or no  it was sitting on mount everest  you could not climb  that s understandable  maybe you don t have the legs and the lungs to get to the top of the mountain  but what is within you  if you don t find  obviously you re on a con job or no  so to get you out of this deception  is all my work is  my work is not to dispense truth  who am i to do that    this s so true  so true  to be on the lighter note  being a film man  which is your favorite hindi film    oh   they expect something from me like this    oh   to be on lighter note   it s been a very long time since i saw one  just recently  i think on the airline  i saw one  this is about something in the  in a bihari mountain  i think manjhi  something   manjhi   that s a good movie    yes  sir   and manjhi copied his getup also  i think   i think it was very well done   yes  i think something like that  and furthermore lighter  guru   which is that screen heroine you fell in love in your    i m sorry   which is that heroine film heroine  film heroine     you fell in love in your younger age   me  oh no   now you love human being   no  they were enough girls around in my town   i didn t have to look to mumbai    now let s come to his sphere now  please  is that guruji has been talking very fondly about his chamundi hills  and i m fortunate enough to have visited chamundi hills and i shot one of my film called krodhi on chamundi hills   oh really    yes sir  so  i m very fond of mysore locations and all of those  i made pardes and all that  so i remember i was making film called krodhi in 1978 and there was a scene i shot because i thought that was the right location for this scene  can i explain you one minute the scene part of it   mhmm    it was a dharmendra and pran scene  that one criminal has entered into the team of saints in disguise  the guruji of that team accept him as   there re lot of saints who don t need any help from outside    so there was a scene when the criminal asked guru   don t teach me about this god and destiny  and all this  i know it all  he said that  i wrote the  i wrote dialogues  he says   there must be a very smart and very shrewd guy 1000 years back  who created these two worlds called god and the other world called fate  he created world god because he wanted his children to follow what he said  what he wants them to believe  so he made them a fear of god  and fate he created the world because when he child fails in following all the principles laid down by him  he says it is your destiny  it is your bhagya   so i know it all  and this was a question he put it to guru  and guru answered him that there was one shila in chamundi hill we created and there was some writings on the stones  he says   look at it    referring to hindi phrase   devotion is nothing but a power  god is nothing but a man who is great  love is nothing but bliss that you and me have to find in one another  you have got a wisdom but there is a layer on you of the worldly pollution  so you are a man of intellect but you do not realize the importance of it  so this is why i remember chamundi hills  because i wrote this scene there while sitting on the stone   oh  hope not the same rock as me    so i thought that is how you become sadhguru because you belong to chamundi hill   thank you  sir  now  my short questions in my mind since my childhood is  what is the difference between a rich man and a wealthy man  who s really rich man   ahh  one who has the new currency is a rich man    so  you mean to say the man with the old currency has gone poor   poorer   see  unfortunately  we have brought the world to a place  where the words like rich or wealth have become purely economic descriptions  there was a time when people would talk about wealth of knowledge or wealth of wisdom  that s gone  today  if you say wealthy  people will only understand it as an economic wealth because in many ways  today  society is driven by economics  there was a time  when we were overly influenced by the british  at least we would discuss the weather   of course  mumbai weather  there s nothing much to discuss   but today  all conversations are around economy  everywhere in the world  everybody is behaving like an economist these days because it is the economic engine  which is driving people s minds  it is the economic engine  which is determining the nature of choices that we make in the world  it is the economic opportunities  which determine what  what kind of education people go through  people are not studying what they want to know  people are studying that which will fetch them the maximum money  yes or no   so  maybe a few are still marrying for love   everything has become economic  in united states  a whole lot of people  before marriage they re signing a contract in case we divorce  what s the deal   how can two people become one when this calculation is on  but the  even the idea of becoming one has been given up  it s always two  the idea and the dream of two people becoming one has been completely given up because when economic calculation comes  you become exclusive  you can t be inclusive  so economics are ruling us in every way  so when you say richness  when you say wealth  we re only talking about money  not just richness and wealth  if you say   he s a big man in the town  it doesn t mean that he has a big brain  it doesn t mean that he has a big heart  it means he has a big pocket  nothing else  this is a very poor way to exist  when we do this   the ladies must know this   when economics become the main crux of everything that we do  the feminine will vanish from the world  or feminine will be subjugated  if women have to succeed  they have to become like men  there is no other way  masculine will be everything  that means world will become utilitarian  there ll be no aesthetic  there ll be no beauty  there ll be no gentleness  everything will be a calculation   what is useful  what is not useful  what do i get  what do you get  there will be no home  there will be only a marketplace everywhere  in the marketplace  the rules of the marketplace are like this   if i give less and take more  that means i m smart  yes or no  if you buy  you go to the share market  you buy for less and sell it for more  that is smart  but life doesn t work like that  life becomes beautiful only when you re willing to give it all and you don t care what you get   unfortunately  economics means an organized approach to survival  now  we ve made survival  when we were in the caves  survival was a big issue  we organized civilization with so much effort because we thought we could leave survival behind and focus on higher dimensions of life  but once again  we have brought ourselves to a place  or bringing ourselves to a place  where survival is supreme  nothing else matters now  only thing is we ve raised the bar of survival in such a way that it doesn t matter what you have  you re still trying to survive  affluent nations in the world  the western countries  where almost every citizen has everything that is needed  they re still fighting for survival   fighting for survival like nobody else   i keep asking the american people   you guys  all the time talking about freedom  where is freedom in your life  because even if the most significant dimension appears in your life  you can t take a turn  i keep joking with them    you know  some time ago  2000 years ago  jesus came and said   come  follow me  a few people followed him  but today  if your jesus comes back and says   come follow me  where can you follow him  you have a thirty five year mortgage on your house   you have still a student loan at the age of forty five  you have a car loan  you have insurance  you have this  you re not going to follow  you got a bank to go to   you re not going to follow anything  it doesn t matter even if a divine entity arrives  you cannot change the direction of your life  this is not freedom  freedom means you should be able to change and alter your life according to the opportunities that come  isn t it  if something truly significant comes  you should be able to turn around and do something else  because we have enshrined economics as the highest value  all these things are gone  everything is about money  and wealth means just money again  most of the wealth that we have today in the world is just made up in people s minds  in 2008  when recession was setting in the western countries  i happened to be at davos at the economic forum  at that year  india was running a campaign in switzerland  the campaign was  india everywhere  all the american and european business leaders were all looking very depressed because recession was coming  that means they had a few billion dollars less than what they had  and they were all very depressed so depressed means you very touchy and angry with everything  indian people were rubbing it in their face   i get down in switzerland  huge hoardings  india everywhere  on the buses   india everywhere  inside the train   india everywhere  so it was irritating everybody   so they asked me to handle a session called  recession and depression   i said   recession is bad enough  depression is worse  all of you have always been complaining you don t have enough free time  this is the time to walk on the beach   what are you complaining about  what is it that we re complaining about  so  there was a chinese bureaucrat  see  the way we have structured the economic engine is such  it is like that panchatantra story  where a monkey is sitting on the wrong end of the branch and chopping the branch  if it succeeds  it will fall  that s how we are right now  so  i said   see  the way you have s  structured this is if we succeed  we shall fail  that s how we are right now because if you fail  you will be depressed  if we succeed  the world will be damned  yes  the way we re going  so i said   it s better you re depressed because  if your ambitions are fulfilled  there ll be no planet left  that s where we re going  so this chinese bureaucrat did a wonderful thing  he  there was a big mirror  he put one chair and he said   see  there are two chairs   one chair here  one chair in the mirror  they all said yes  then he covered up the mirror and he said   see  now there s only one chair  they said yes  then he said   always there was only one chair   you made it up with a mirror that there are two chairs  the wealth on the planet is not gone anywhere  it is just distributing itself a little bit  every time it slips out of your hands and goes to somebody  you will get depressed  he was saying it s moving to china    thank you  thank you  thank you for sharing the chair also with us    here  there are two    two chairs  thank you very much for saving two chairs  now  the other question comes in my mind  sir  about the education to children  there is a slogan going on in our country   right to educate  right to education  and i always feel that more than right to education  there has to be a right kind of education  because educating c a t cat is a bat  it s not a right education  right kind of educations is more important  that s what i feel and i say  where do we lack the whole process of education for the so many years  see  rather century or eighty years that we have not been living with the intellectual power till now  we face that  i say india is not intellect  is economically poor  india is intellectually poor at the moment because there has been a big gap of the whole process of education  the right kind of educations to all of our children  what is your take on it  sadhguru   see  india is not  definitely not poor on intellect  i would say   you are one  we are thousands   no   i speak to all kinds of people around the world   business leaders  academics  scientists  but still i would say   when i say  it means ignorance   no  at random  if you pick up hundred people from the street just like that  either in mumbai or chennai or bangalore  i would say they are way smarter than most people that you can pick up anywhere in the world   only  hey  you shouldn t clap for yourself like this   i should have left out mumbai   it is just that we do not have an organization for this intellect to find expression  because there is no necessary structures to find expression  each person operates  this is one thing about india  everybody thinks he s a genius    that s our education    and you will see  everybody is an expert on everything  it s like  if you go to a local tea shop  he will tell you how virat kohli s strokes are not perfect   how he should do like this  like that  he will say how narendra modi does not know how to be a prime minister   what he should do   we face every time  a paanwala tells me how to make a story    he knows everything in the world but it s just that he can t make good tea   it s just one little lacuna  otherwise everything else he s an expert   we have this as a little bit of an issue in the country  this is mainly because there is no outlet  for this enormous intellect that country has  there is no structures for people to find expression to that  you just see take indian people and put them anywhere  they re just on the tops   survivors   it s not about surviving  they re thriving  because once they find proper structures and they understand the structure  you can t stop them because there is a necessary intellect  this is a consequence of a very huge history  a cultural history that we have  today  there are experiments to show  like for example if you  let us say you put the smell of this flower on some food substance and keep it in front of a rat or a mouse and when it goes and touches it  it ll get an electric shock  if you do this a few times  next seven generations  those rats will not go towards that smell  all of them understand  this is their learning  so similarly  within the human being  a lot that was done in the past  which is  which we call as samskara  that means intrinsic learning that we have  is still paying off  or in other words  we still surviving on old food  it is time that this generation gets the right stuff  but that s not happened yet because our education systems and every system that we had has been disrupted badly in a systematic way because we ve been an occupied nation for nearly a 1000 years  some came and just ravaged everything  others came and systematically destroyed everything  and they created an education system  which was mainly towards obedience and clerical kind of work to serve her majesty s service  in 1947  when we got our independence  we should have seriously thought about what kind of education does india need  we must understand this   without any infrastructure  literally without infrastructure  without any kind of education  our farmers are producing food for 1 25 billion people   this is knowledge  why is this not knowledge  i m asking  why is this not knowledge  why is this not competence  i  i was talking to a group of ceos  i was just telling them   see  i ll give you ten acres of very fertile land  you do one thing  i ll give you a couple of two different crops  you take out the harvest  let me see  all of you are mba  mba  whatever  you take out a crop  let me see  it ll freak the hell out of you  i m telling you  it s not easy  i ve personally farmed  i know what it takes  it is  the more educated you are  the more difficult it becomes    really because it takes a very  a very  a close sense of involvement with what you re doing  and from this  from ploughing the land to the seed to taking the crop out  it is not a easy process  but our farmers are just doing it like that as if it s just part of their life  something that they just inherited  this is a nation with over 12 000 years of agricultural history  the only land like that on the planet  in southern india  they re farming the same land for over 12 000 years  there are certain records  which show this  so  there is knowledge like this on various levels  but we have tried to push everything aside and reinvent the wheel  once again  we want to learn abc and do it like this  so  there is a disruption in the intrinsic learning that we have and the school learning that is coming to us  i m saying  just read a book  however educated you may be  read a book and make one good sambar  let me see   it won t come   yeah  that s exactly question is  yeah   because we are thinking only what is written in the book  a   b   c is only knowledge  why is not making a wonderful sambar knowledge  why is not growing a crop knowledge  why is not making a pot knowledge  we have very constipated sense of what is knowledge  because   the school system    because this has come from elsewhere  some indian student in oxford   i was just  not even a month  three weeks ago i was speaking at the oxford union in oxford university   one of the indian students has filed a court petition that he should be compensated for the boring classes that they re teaching in oxford university   i was very happy   that s why i never went   that s why i never went to the university    that amazes me  that is why the school system  the textbook  the six answers to the exam  six questions in the exam  after studying whole year  it really amazes me  that is why i always feel  what not the internal enlightenment to the children   see  the problem is  why we re talking about right to education is  we have  for example   i don t know the exact number all over the country   in tamil nadu itself  we have 9 6 million children in the government schools alone  okay  9 6 million children  when you have such vast numbers  then you have to do something  what you do for the mass is never the best  but what to do  you have to include everybody  so  some rudimentary sense of education is happening because at least they must learn to  if you don t know this  seventies and eighties  the objective was  everybody should know how to write their name  a campaign was  literacy means you must know how to write your name  this is all  that is  they were trying to move them from thumb imprint to something written  it did not change life in any way but it was a forward movement in a sense  but we must know this  when the british came  around two hundred and seventy to three hundred years ago  there was not a single illiterate person in this country  they were amazed because there were no schoolrooms anywhere  there was no school infrastructure but there was no illiterate  everybody could read and write   vidhwan  everybody was vidhwan   so they wondered  how does this happen  then they realized the system is so organic that it is simply happening from within  so the first thing they decided was   we must destroy this education system because if you educate them like this  they will never become english  see  i m the only indian left in this hall   so  this system of education that we have inherited from those who occupied this nation  see  we must understand this   you never take advice from your enemy  isn t it  if you have some sense  i m saying   so   when they leave your country and go  first things to overhaul is your political system  your education system  your administrative system  these are things must be overhauled immediately because they were created for a certain purpose  for example  even today   the terminology we re using  i m saying   the district administrators in many states including tamil nadu are referred to as collectors  in the british time  they were just tax collectors  their only administration was to collect tax and take it back home  even today  our administrators are called collectors  what are they supposed to collect from us   i m saying we didn t change anything  we  we were just lazy  we were just happy that we ve become free  but freedom is a terrible thing  if you do not understand the responsibility of being free  freedom is a terrible thing  if somebody is managing our life  it is better  when we are not responsible  only if we re truly responsible  freedom is a wonderful thing  otherwise  freedom is a terrible thing    maturity  freedom must come with the maturity  that s true  guruji  i belong to middle class  brought up by middle class family  and most of us are middle class people  what is this middle class   i m doing well  i m educated  i m graduate  still they call me   you re middle class    and we  most of us run the country   see  this is an aspirational thing  when large segments of the country were in extreme poverty  the aspiration was to become middle class  middle class means you have college education  you may not be very rich  but you re college educated  you have a job and  you have a regular job  usually  government employees were middle class at one time  slowly  others joined up  now middle class people are driving mercedes benz   okay   is it in the terms of the economic development  or the knowledge or the enlightenment  what is   in which term they are middle class   oh  it was definitely an economic description  and there was a big goof up with this middle class  i think it was in nineties  a certain us firm came  which was  i forget the name of the firm  they came to do a market survey for ford motor company  and they came here and they said some hundred million  two hundred million whatever number of middle class families in india  so ford can go to india  no problem because it has the largest middle class  so  ford came and set up the plant at that time  and they couldn t sell ten cars   then they found out  a middle class in india is earning 10 000 rupees a month and he can only cycle to his office  no question of he buying a car  it took them a while to understand  everybody have their own idea of middle class   they thought middle class means in america  middle class means somebody who s earning somewhere between 60 000  i mean  30 000 dollars to 100 000 dollars is middle class  here  at that time  india s middle class is  if they earn approximately 10 15 000 rupees per month  they were middle class  which is just three hundred dollars  so   everybody has their own idea of middle class  but we can take this to another place  now you are claiming you re middle class    because it always  i wonder  middle class means naa idhar ke  na udhar ke  neither this side nor that side  neither i ve an identity  whether it s poor or rich  they are clear about themselves  i am poor guy  he is clear i m a rich guy  the middle class is neither this way nor that way  in what terms  that was bothering me but you answered   aspiring to be rich but haven t made it    you look at it like that i a m taking all the  this golden opportunity to ask you   the question which bothers me at times is about the world called democracy  what is democracy and what should be the relationship between the leaders and the people  the government and the people  and in growing democracy  who gets corrupt first  the leader or the people  that s my question    see  the  in tamil  the word for democracy is jananayakam  that means people are the leaders   by the people  for the people  of the people   that means there is no leader and there are no people  people are the leaders  that s what democracy means  unfortunately  people have forgotten that they are the leaders  i hear  even today morning or yesterday an  evening  i was being interviewed  today morning  i was being interviewed by a journalist in lucknow  so  he said   these politicians  i said   there are no politicians  they didn t fall from the sky  they re just you and me  somebody who s willing to do the dirty job for you  what you think is dirty and you don t want you yourself or your children to get into  somebody got into it for you  yes   and once you get there  the entire game is such that it just dirties your hands  you can t help it  it s become like that  the system  so in democracy  there is no leader and people  it s people and people   but obviously  there are leaders and there are people today   that is because we have allowed it  otherwise  every five years  you could stand up and become a leader  that s how it should be  we have not kept it mobile enough because we have this tendency of giving responsibility to somebody and forget about it   and forget it for five years   only when something goes wrong  we will scream  otherwise  we don t care a damn   no  if you   when it is essential  if you re making a movie or somebody is running a business  not after something goes wrong you ll attend to it as a director  you are on it every moment to see it goes right   yes  sir   so  i am saying  once you live in a democracy  you must be an active participant  it is not a spectator sport  to sit back and forget about it and then cry when something goes wrong  i m telling you  even your home will not run right if you don t pay enough attention  forget about the nation  yes or no  even your home  your own family will become corrupt if you re not paying attention to many things  yes or no   yes   you don t like it but it s true  isn t it  if you don t pay  constant attention  even your home will go bad and corrupt  so  when this is the thing  such a large nation  if everybody doesn t pay attention to what needs to happen  it will go bad  then we cry  we have this problem   when small things go wrong  we have somebody here  when big things go wrong  we have somebody there   this guy    is free  free    he is never responsible for anything   this has to change    yes  but we  i  see  the most beautiful thing about democracy is power can change hands without blood flowing  never before it s happened in human history  whenever power changes  blood will flow  now  power can shift from one group of people to another group without blood spilling  which is a huge achievement    but we as individual need to understand that i am the part of the democracy and i m equally responsible as my leaders are   see  i think one mistake we have done is  in our education systems  in our homes  there is no awareness about this  that there are instruments in a democratic process through which all of us can participate in some way   on a daily basis  if we wish  this has  this awareness has not been brought to people  they think if they cast vote once in ten years  because one election they ll miss  you know   then the election day they went to goa   one they will miss  one they will vote and they think they are very responsible citizens because they voted once in ten years  that s not how it works  you need an active participation  then only democracy will work the way it has to work  right now  our idea of leadership is if we find a good leader  we will start worshipping them  a good leader does not need worship  what a leader needs  if somebody is  a competent leader comes at the top  what he needs is  he needs many layers of leadership  so that he will find traction to what he wishes to do  but you will see  if a good leader comes  he will spin on the spot because there is no traction down the line  either there are worshipping people or those who re busy with their own stuff  so  we need to understand  democracy means we have taken the nation into our hands  we need to make it happen  somebody will guide it  somebody will make policies  somebody will take some decisions  but the nation is run by the people  if we don t get it  then we will always be just complaining  we will not have a great nation  if we want a great nation  we have to stand up and take charge of this country  taking charge of the country does not mean usurping power tomorrow morning  no  where we are  what roles we have to play  we should be doing our best  people are always talking about politicians being corrupt  but i m asking you  if there is no policeman on the street  how many people will stop at the red light  i think about ten percent  i m being generous  i know   about ten percent  the rest  if you elect any one of them as a chief minister or the prime minister  what do you think they will do  because they re law breakers anyway  i see  you know  normally i land in coimbatore late in the night  ten o clock  eleven o clock  one o clock  whatever time  and i m driving from the airport  red light  i stop  there is one little tvs moped guy who s parked behind me  kee kee he will do   then i don t go till the green light comes  he comes next to me and says like this     what s wrong with you  he thinks i m a fool  all right   exactly  exactly     his thing is   no policeman  what are you doing here  go  so  if you make these people into  if you put these people into positions of power  what  people who re on positions of power are on spotlight  so everything that they do is seen  but corruption is all pervading  isn t it  within the house  between a girl child and a boy  there is a distinction  this is corruption  between a right hand and left hand  one is superior   one is inferior  this is corruption  so  corruption is not just up there taking money or whatever  corruption is on all levels  isn t it  there is no evenhandedness about life  we ve brought this to everything  this has to go means spiritual process is needed  if i can  share something i think i must have shared already  i ll leave it    spiritual process is important   because an inclusiveness is needed  you must transcend looking at things as superior and inferior  one is higher  one is lower  you learn to look at everything  this is one thing that happened to me very early  i realized i don t know anything  so i started paying attention to just about anything  one thing i discovered with people around me was  they could pay attention or they would pay attention only to those things that they thought is important  rest of it  they learned to ignore  i couldn t do this because i couldn t decide what is important  i found the ant crawling on my  on the floor was far more important to me by  than my father  who was asking me to do something at that moment  i m saying   yes  it was  it is so for your child also  isn t it so  your child is looking at the ant  is he not does he not think the ant is more important than you at that moment   yes  he does  because it s more interesting than you   it is   it is the finest piece of mechanics that you can find on the planet  if you could build an automobile like an ant  whoa  it would just go anywhere  you know  so  i got into this mode of paying attention to just about anything because it never occurred to me something is more important  something is less important  my father believed that he s a very  he s a disciplinarian   tch  so he thought   so evening  seven o clock to nine o clock in the evening  me and my siblings must study something  textbook  and he will be sitting there reading some magazine or newspaper  so that we study  i ve no issues about all that  if i just open my book i just open somewhere   i never had the habit   even today  i don t have the habit   i always open somewhere  if i read one page  i know the author s mind through and through  so i don t read beyond that   so i open somewhere and on the page  i find a small speck of something  you know  some flaw in the page  if i just look at it  it held my attention  entire two hours  i was like this   looking at the spot  i never read a single word  nor did i look up anywhere  i just got absorbed into this little spot  there was enough in that little spot to keep me engaged for two hours  why i m saying this is  this is the biggest mistake we re making with life  we are setting this up in our children s minds   this is god  this is devil  this is superior  this is inferior  this is mine  this is not mine  in this  you re causing corruption  you re bringing corruption to the infant to recognize one thing as high  one thing as low  one thing as mine  one thing as not mine  here  corruption has started  if you make this child that you brought him up like this into a prime minister  of course he will be corrupt  whatever  if you  by getting into a position of responsibility and power  it only gets magnified  somebody doesn t just get corrupt the moment they get there  they ve been corrupt all their life  they ve been trained in corruption by their parents and their society  now  it got magnified because the opportunity is magnified  so  corruption is not up there  corruption is everywhere  if you are concerned about corruption  just sit at home and see how many things are there in your life  which you need to iron out  yes or no   yes   if you don t take this out  you have no right to complain about corruption because corruption is in your home  corruption is in your mind  corruption is all around you  it is just that those who re in positions of power  you expect them to be clean  i also do  but i don t believe that will happen unless down the line also we aspire for that in our lives  because the kind of people we are  that s the kind of leaders we elect  isn t it  we have some aspiration to change it but we are not determined to change it  something that is negative  something that is rotting in a society will not go away unless we re determined to change it  strong determination to change it  otherwise it will just go on  rot is not something that you can simply get rid of because rot spreads by itself  it is cleanliness  which is  which doesn t spread by itself  you have to do the cleaning  but rot spreads by itself  so corruption spreads by itself  if you want to bring cleanliness  you have to strive  first of all  bringing it into your life  otherwise it s not going to work  we ll only talk about it   sadhguru  you re a master of knowledge and history  mythology  everything and i feel that i m a child of ancient india  and i know indian 1000 years back  indian hundred years back and indian today  1000 years ago  this s how they looked    not to the getup  how i have changed from 1000 to hundred to today and why i have changed  is it a better or need to be better   what is the change  you re asking   yes  what s the change as an indian  how much we have changed   when we talk about india  1000 means we re talking about recent times   ancient times   recent   recent  1000 years  yeah  i say 4000 5000 years   so  india as a culture exists for over 12 15 000 years  at one time  we became a nation with enormous intellect  enormous capabilities  very crucible of science  mathematics  astronomy  the greatest scientists in the world have acknowledged  modern science could not have taken a single step without the mathematic that came from india  so  there were tremendous minds that we evolved because we had what is called as samskriti  today  we have isha samskriti school  which is on these lines  samskriti means   sam means equanimous and exuberant  kriti means way of doing it  that is  getting life to a place  where it is exuberant and equanimous  if you keep your life exuberant and equanimous  now this life will be full fledged life  this is the aspiration of every life  whether it is an earthworm  or a bird or a tree  all of them are aspiring to become full fledged life  so  is a human being  only thing is we know what is a full fledged earthworm  we know what is a full fledged bird  we know what is a full fledged tree but we do not know what is a full fledged human being  no matter what you become  still you feel it s not enough  it doesn t matter what you have become  in somebody else s eyes  you might have become big  but within you  you know this is not enough because what is human is a limitless possibility   expansion   because for every other creature  nature has set two lines  between these two lines  they live and die  for a human being  there is only bottom line  there s no top line  so most human beings are suffering their freedom  if you re suffering your bondage  understandable  but if you re suffering your freedom  that s a bad thing  but that s what is happening  human problem is   what to do with myself  whatever you do  it s not enough  whatever you do  it s not enough  if you had come like any other creature  your survival taken care of  everything is fine with you  isn t it  eating  sleeping  reproduction  if it happens  you were fulfilled  but that is not the thing with human  when these things are in question  they are big  once they happen  they are nothing  so  this transition  what you re talking about  historical movement of human beings in this country  there was a time when we hit a peak  but we became so absorbed in finer aspects of life  what  that we did not have fighting men  our biggest strength was  we were placed in a geographical crucible  where we were well protected  we called this hindustan  not after a religion  as people think it is today  or some people think it s after a language  no  a land which lies between himalayas and the indu sagara or the indian ocean  this is hindu  why we worship these two geographical features is  we knew our well being comes from these two features  the himalayan ranges and the indian ocean protected us  so we could focus on the development of the human being  when every other society was constantly ravaged by external forces  we remained untouched for a long period of time  but when people came  they did not come as invaders  they just came in few hundreds   hundred  two hundred people  they were actually bandits  they wanted to rape  loot and run  but then they found  people were so docile  people were deeply involved in spirituality  mathematics  music  astronomy  somebody who s looking at the stars can t fight  someone who is singing music cannot fight   somebody who s into  you know  counting numbers or doing mathematics cannot fight  they found this was such an easy land  bandits became emperors   they stayed there only   they stayed back  why run   they decided to stay back and they became emperors  and these are not people with any administrative skills  they were barbarians  so  they ruled that way  so immense suffering happened  but we had an evolved sense of intellect and philosophy and ideology through which we survived  it doesn t matter how you beat them  they didn t fight back but they survived  they not only survived  they kept their culture  they kept their samskriti  they kept their tradition to whatever extent they could and survived and survived and survived  after over a 1000 years of invasions and all kinds of rules over us  still this is the only culture on the planet  which still has a flavor of its indigenous origins  everybody else is totally wiped out   but it has not been easy  it has not been the best of times  what was the greatest economic power on the planet just three hundred years ago  we became one of the poorest nations in a matter of two hundred and fifty to three hundred years  i think at about two hundred and seventy years  we became the poorest nation because everything was shipped out  but still  we re coming back once again  we have an intellect  we need a determined leadership to wake us up a little bit  we re little sleepy  you know  because for generations  ten fifteen generations  our mothers have taught us  never confront a problem on the street  if you see a problem  come home   yes  this is what our mothers have taught us because this is the mentality of an occupied nation   don t raise your head  put it down and come home because if you raise your head you may lose it  but if we want to generate leaders in the nation  we need people who seek problems and confront problems on a daily basis   the moment you seek and confront a problem  half the nation resists  it doesn t matter what s the problem   see  everybody was talking about black money  all right   it was one of the conversations always going on  when they don t have money  they would say somebody else has black money   the money that i have is white  what you have must be black     this has been the mindset  but when you try to take some action  just look at the voices all over  is it the best action  is it the wrong action  that s not the point  we can debate it endlessly  but the thing is  it is some action in that direction    we talk about sanskriti  you said about sanskriti  and i wonder since my childhood that in my home and other places also  i always find pundits chanting sanskrit mantra  we get married  the mantras are all in sanskrit  whether we understand them or not   you re not supposed to understand all that    that is what i was told  and everywhere  i find mantras and pundits  on all auspicious occasion  or whatever the occasion is  and we respect somewhere  like the back of our mind  we respect our language  ancient language sanskrit  but when it comes to our kids to learn sanskrit  we tell them   learn that language  which gives you a job  this will not give you a job  and we are very shy to allow them to learn sanskrit  why it is so  sadhguru   see  this is  as i said  we have experienced ten  twelve  almost fifteen generations of abject poverty  so  when we re in such a state of poverty  our only concern is our children should somehow survive  somehow get one degree  get a job   this used to be the mantra in sixties and seventies  get a government job somehow  or become a doctor  that s the best thing  your life is made  somebody else gets sick but your life is made   this is coming from a certain fear that your children may not survive  if they don t pass this  this  this examination  they may end up on the street  because that s all the options there were  they  it was not a false fear  if your chi  child did not get educated  unless he was super talented with something  most probably he ll end up as a street bum  that was a fact  but slowly things have changed  our economic situation has changed dramatically  whether we want to recognize it or not  in seventies how you were living and how you are living today  there is a phenomenal different in the material wealth  so today  our children have many more options  we can little go slow on this job oriented education  still  there is a large segment of india  which still has to go that way  but we  those who re reasonably well to do can go little slow on their children  i created three different dimensions of education  one is rural education  which is called isha vidhya  to bring awareness to this  tomorrow we re golfing at wellingdon   to bring awareness to rural education  this education is designed purely to get these children out of their economic and social pit they re in  this is  from the age of six  they re learning english language  within one year  they become fluent in english language and they start working on the computers  this english language and computer is their passport out of the village  this is the goal  this is run in a certain way  we have another school called isha home school  this is for the affluent  this is run in a completely different way with an enormous inclusion of sport  art  theater  all kinds of music  every kind of thing that you can add to aesthetics to it  the school itself is created in a very aesthetic way  so the children experience a different dimension of life  and these children live in groups of twenty in a household with a dedicated couple  who are parents for these children for the first five years  and the next five years  they ll have another set of parents  they move into a different house  these children grow up with enormous exposure to all kinds of talents  for example  now i made their eleventh and twelfth  which is two years  into three years  i said   in our school  it s three years  because we have invested so much on music  art  dance  theater  all these things  the moment they come to eleventh standard  many parents go marks mad  suddenly  marks  marks  marks will come  they want to drop the music  they want to drop every other art they ve learnt  so i said three years  so extra this one year  whatever they are good at  they will become much more proficient in that  if they are good musicians  they will go into that  if they re good in theater  they ll go into art  we re exposing them to leadership  management  business  variety of things  but your children will get out of the school one year late  i think you can afford it because you re well to do  you have only one child or maybe two children  it s all right  your child gets to work one year later  it s perfectly okay  initially  everybody thought it s crazy  now everybody wants to be there  another dimension of education  here there is no formal education  there are only six things that they learn  they start with yoga  kalari payattu  which is the mother of all martial arts  classical music  classical dance  sanskrit language  english language  this is all they study  first four years  these six subjects  after four years  they will drop any two of them and keep that four  and after another two and a half to three years  time  they ll drop two more  and the next five years to six years  they will do only two subjects  they will become experts in that  you must come and see these children  you won t believe how they are  they are incredible because this is focused towards building the human body and the human brain to its fullest  if you want something to perform  first thing is you must build the machine  you must build the machine to a higher level of capability  then only it ll perform  right now  the biggest problem with the modern world is we are too goal oriented  we want to enhance our activity without enhancing who we are  this is why everybody is talking about stress  whatever simple jobs they re doing  they re stressful because they have enhanced their activity without enhancing themselves  it s like you take your maruti 800 on a racetrack  it will fall apart   it s not built for that  i m saying  it s okay to go to your office  if you race it  it ll  it ll break up  so similarly  if you want to enhance your activity  you don t worry about the activity  if you enhance the human being  he will perform the activity according to his capability  so  this is focused on just developing the human being  these children are in another zone altogether  fantastic  i you won t believe it  i must tell you this  the first batch  i was to initiate them about five years ago  when they become fifteen years of age they stay with us from the age of six to eighteen  when they become fifteen  three years they take brahmacharya  it is three year period they must take and at eighteen  they must go off  it is not compulsory beyond that   till that point because we want them to focus  when i had to initiate them at the age of fifteen  they go for a sixty days of silence  okay  total silence    i have to initiate them  i want to see how the children are doing  about three four days before the initiation  i go there to see them  30 in the evening  okay  in a day  at least six hours  they are sitting with their eyes closed doing sadhana  and all kinds of sadhana   at least about eleven to twelve hours of sadhana  in this  at least six hours  they re sitting with eyes closed  30 in the morning  the first batch was only fourteen  today its grown into big number  i go there and sit with them  nearly half of them are girls and the rest are boys  i went and sat  i  i just looked at these children  they were literally glowing  i sat there and wept because i was not like this when i was fifteen  i know that very well  these children are literally glowing like lights  they re just sitting like this  unmoving  i just sat there for over two hours  they didn t move a bit  they just sat like stone  i just bowed down to them and came that  this is fantastic    they are only fifteen  fifteen year old children    that is exactly when i said the right kind of education  this is the right kind of education   yes  but at the same time  as i said  we are a huge population  if we want to improve our education  it has to grow   if we want to improve our education  if we want to improve nourishment  if we want to improve the traffic situation  if we want to improve anything in this country  we have to reduce our population  there is no other way    one very interesting question in my mind i ve been facing since my childhood we are talking all due respect to the belief of every guru and  no  you don t have to respect my belief because i don t have any    when you are talking about the adiyogi the great lord shiva  i remember my mother used to go to lord shiva s temple and i used to accompany her  and she would tell me that lord shiva belongs to the three lokas   dharti  akash  pataal  so my father brought one globe showing the geography of the earth and i asked my mother   is lord shiva you re talking about the three worlds    i turned the globe  i said    does these americans know lord shiva  so is lord shiva territorial or universal  that still question lies in me    let s understand this in the right context  the word shiva   shi va means that which is not  that which is  is physical creation  that which is not  is that which is not physical  that which is not  where can it be  in india or america   or on this planet or in another galaxy  where can it be  it s everywhere  so  there is a dimensionless existence  so we called it appropriately   shi va  that means that which is not  today  modern scientists are saying that nearly ninety nine percent of the cosmos is empty  but not that there is nothing   there is something but it is not something  because our idea of something is we should be able to perceive through five senses  see right now  what you can see and what you cannot see is this  you can see my hand because it is stopping light  anything that is not stopping light  you don t see  isn t it  right now  there is air here  which you re breathing  which is most vital from your  for your existence  but you don t see it  you don t see the air unless you live in delhi   that s the privilege of being in the capital city   now  if you look up in the sky  you see the stars  but stars are a small happening  the real thing is the vast emptiness  so this we referred to as shi va  that which is not  today  modern scientists are saying this vast space has a tremendous amount of energy  but it is not any of the energies that are measurable by us  like electromagnetic waves  or weak nuclear energy  or strong nuclear energy  or electrical systems  or microwaves  none of these things  it is none of the measurable energies  but there is no denying it is tremendously powerful  so we said shi va means that which is not  and we said it is in the lap of shiva that creation happens  at the same time  we called adiyogi also the shiva because he perceived that which is not  you are who you are people call you a director  a film producer  why  because you perceived something  if you did not perceive that  they would not recognize you as that  so we recognized adiyogi as shiva because he perceived that which is not  because he perceived that  we called him also shiva  then maybe there are any number of people at least in southern india  almost ninety percent of the males are named after shiva  we call that man also shiva because we know if he does the right things  he can also realize that he is shiva  we named our dog also shiva  yes  because we know he is also made of the same stuff  but he does not know  but we must remind him by naming him shiva   we ll call the dog also shiva  shiva  no problem  in another country  in another religion  they would be very insulted if you named your dog by their god s name  but you ll see in the villages  dogs in only in the cities  they have this problem   all their dogs have english names   this is because this pet dog business came from the english people  for us  dogs were there on the street and we never taught of taking dogs and fondling them like this    only the english were doing it because they were away from home and they must have been feeling lonely    that s the reason  yes   now you see in india  every so called middle class family   all their dogs have english names  so  we will call the ultimate reality as shiva  the one who realized that  the adiyogi  as shiva  one who did not realize that but has the possibility  we ll call him shiva  we ll call the dog also shiva because he is also made of the same stuff  but he cannot know  but we want him to hear that sound  so every time we call him shiva  shiva  shiva  we hope that we will evolve one day    thank you very much for enlightening us  about the real meaning of shiva  so much  and for those of you who do not know  now  on this twenty fourth of february  we are unveiling a  a face of adiyogi  which is hundred and twelve feet tall because  adiyogi adiyogi offered one hundred and twelve ways in which a human being can realize his ultimate potential  hundred and twelve ways to do it  so as a way of honoring him and also to bring back this dimension  that your well being is not in looking up or looking down but looking inward  when we looked up in search of our well being  we became hallucinatory  then as modern societies  as science and technology came  we started looking out for our well being  once we started looking out for our well being  in pursuit of human well being we have ripped the planet apart  true well being will happen to a human being only when they turn inward  to bring this revolution back into the world  for the next generation of people particularly  we built this iconic face  and a book is also ready now  the idea is to move people inward  not up  not out  in   in is the only way out    sadhguru  i  can we show the image of adiyogi  is it possible   yes   on the screen   but i must say  this is the largest face on the planet   yes  i ve gone through your book  it s amazing amazing book and so much enlightenment in it  but the best line which i found was that you said in your book   your joy  your miseries  your love  your agony  your bliss  all lie in your hand  some are suffering their failures  some are suffering their consequences of their success  some are suffering their limitation and some are suffering their freedom  what s the way out    in is the way out  because all human experience is caused from within us   it s within us   everything that ever happens to you happens within you  what happens within you must happen your way  isn t it  right now  we are trying to fix the world to fix this one   it s not going to work like that  if you fix this one   then we can create a world the way we want it  but right now  we think by fixing the world  this is going to be all right  it s not gonna happen like that   great  great enlightenment
