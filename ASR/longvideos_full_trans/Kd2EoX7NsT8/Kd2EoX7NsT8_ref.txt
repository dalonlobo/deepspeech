when we say krishna the essence of who he's he is an irrepressible child a terrible prankster an enchanting flute player a graceful dancer an irresistible lover a truly wayland warrior a rootless vanquisher of his foes a man who left a broken heart in every home and astute statesman and kingmaker a thorough gentleman a yogi of the highest order and the most colorful incarnation krishna to contain him in these seven days is an impossible challenge at the most we can just have a glimpse who he is and that glimpse should be more than enough krishna is seen and perceived and understood and experienced in many many different ways by different people duryodhana through the eyes of duryodhana but those of you who do not know the background i will be because unless you understand the whole tapestry of the story and the situation in which he existed many aspects of fogies will be missed so we will go into it but right now duryodhana is a man because of certain situations into which he was placed insecure angry jealous greedy and feeling wronged all his life and because of actions which came forth from his greed and anger he became the key for destruction of his whole race in duryodhana swards he's a smiling rogue if there was ever one he can eat he can drink he can sing he can dance he can make love he can fight he can gossip with old woman play with little children who says he is god that's three of them is perception rowdy his childhood lover a milkmaid a simple woman of the village but with such unfaltering love and devotion she has become so big that today you cannot talk of krishna without ravi we don't say krishna vada we say radha krishna she has become a simple village woman she has become as significant as krishna or little more significant than him she said krishna is with me he is always with me wherever he is whoever he is with he's still with me that's her perception second in a tortured human being because of a certain situation within himself right from his child this is an absolutely tortured soul   chickened and said krishna never gave me any hope but when he is there the breeze of hope touches everybody i can go on like this different people some of different facets of who he is for some he's god for some he's a crook for some he's a lover for some he's a fighter of so many things he is if we want to taste an essence of what it means when we say krishna the consciousness that we referred to as krishna if we have to be touched by this we need lila here we are for the lila lila means it is the part of the playful we are not here just to play we are here to explore the most profound and the most serious aspect of life but playfully conductor playfully in other words krishna won't be there if you want to explore this path playfully if you want to be playful you need a heart full of love a joyful mind and a wide body otherwise there's no leader you sit there a loving heart a joyful mind and a vibrant body do you have only then there is lila the brotherly love if we want to experience the spirit of coca cola they should learn to look at each other with tremendous amount of love we should learn to walk to join our step till krishna was seven he was in this place called goofily this is his childhood joyfully very proudly he says i stole butter if i don't steal butter there would be no zest in the village no excitement i would hide behind a mother and make loving eyes at them and they will smile why krishna is such a huge factor in the cultural ethos of this country is this is a man who romped through his life no matter what was happening his life went through various types of situations right from his childhood many extreme situations but the most important factor is he went through it like a dance joyfully blissfully lovingly wherever he wants whether he's in a battle or just about to behead he's for there was a smile on his face unfortunately people would like to see this as a divine quality smile is a human quality it's not a divine quality human beings who have lost it have transported their joy to heaven they have exported their joy's to heaven only there it's possible you know 24 hours being joyful being loving is not out of reach for the human being and he couldn't believe why his mother is so angry because normally he she gets angry about many things but if he smiles at her if he makes simply okay but today she's not relenting she's continuously angry she just tied him up to the pounding wood he just dragged the pounding wood a very heavy pounding wood and dragged it on outside one younger girl and a little older girl came and they noticed krishna noticed the younger girl was lalita who was his playmate the 12 year old girl was a larger radhe the moment she set her eyes upon krishna a seven year old boy from then he never went out of her eyes he lived in her eyes the bird ravi means drugged me truss color are jews of my paintings this is a bundle ultimate but it is a route of intimacy it is a prize it's not exclude anything but where the nature of the path is such that once a person steps into it everything else just disappears when rowdy was born and she was such a beautiful and lively girl she said the whole village aflame with her life the fragrance of her effervescent nature she set the whole village aflame and her maternal grandmother who was at foster mother was so overjoyed by this girl she just picked up a cart wheel a heavy cart wheel and set lamps on this cart wheel kept it on her head and danced all over the village this family from bar sauna was to migrate to another place called rendang he told her i will come to win darwin once a person raises beyond certain limitations of his consciousness every thought of his becomes the will of god itself so whole gokula went to run darwin and they're a whole new life started so from childhood he is moving on from a little boy he is becoming a little big boy the gopis played with krishna as a child they saw him as their lover they worshiped him as the ultimate large radius turn forms of emotion various forms of relationships this is not different people the same people at different times sometimes this i am as a child sometimes as a lover sometimes as god himself so many old conventions were broken and especially the youth and children enjoyed much more freedom than they'd ever enjoyed before these little boys and girls went to bat at the same time the splashed water of each other and they played they looked at each other things were different on a certain evening a full moon day these boys and girls gathered on the banks of river yamuna and initially they started playing by throwing things at each other hurling words in abuses and having fun throwing water throwing sand then after some time it broke into a dance and they began to dance and they danced and danced and danced because they were in such an exuberant and joyful state and naturally they gathered around him and he just went on almost half the night this is the time this is the first incident of raasleela where a simple joyful mingling of people rose to a transcendental state so he always he presented himself in the best possible way whether it was physical self for his emotional self or mental self or whatever he always presented himself in the best possible way that he could this is lau i want you to understand this if you really have love for life around you you will always see how to be at your best to everything around you if you have care and concern for life around you every moment you must be in the best possible way isn't it yes so krishna exhibited this every moment of his life so he never has a child walked out of the house without a peacock feather in his headdress krishna expressed to his mother that he wants to marry rather his mother said she's not an appropriate girl for you because she's five years older than you and she's already betrothed to somebody else krishna said i don't know all these things of appropriateness from the moment she saw me she has allowed me and she has lived in me so i want to marry this girl this argument went on between mother and son and mother had no words to say so she they put to the father then nanda thought it's time to take him to the guru so that let him speak so gergich arya and his disciple who was to be krishna's teacher sandipani were there and they said your purpose of life is different it has been prophesied that you are the deliverer you're the saviour of dharma in this world krishna said that i don't wish to be a deliverer i just love the cows and the bulls and the men and the woman and the boys and the girls and the mountain and the trees here i don't wish to go and deliver anything i just want to live here i'm in love with people i'm in love with things around here i just want to live here i don't want to save anybody i don't want to deliver anybody i just want to live here then gergich area thought it's time to reveal the truth about his birth so gergich arya talked about the prophecy that nara the money had made and krishna is not nanda issue the son for the first time they revealed to him then gergich area said narada has clearly identified you all the signs indicated to you and you have exhibited all the qualities that neither talked about everything is right you are that person that has been talked about by many sages and nada has fixed the date time and place and you fit into all that it can't be wrong all this descended upon him with such force he just stood there silently and then slowly walk towards menthe go over them a hill like this he just walked up to the topmost point and just to there looking at the sky the sun was setting looking at the setting sun suddenly a tremendous sense of empowerment went through him this was his moment of enlightenment and reminder he just stood there for many hours realizing and experiencing so much within himself when he walked down that hill he was a completely different person altogether that playful cowboy was gone suddenly there was a new serenity about him there was a new sense of a completely new sense of dignity and divinity about him when he walked down all these days these people who just played with him who enjoyed his dance and music suddenly they began to bow down to him he did nothing he just went up the mountain stood there for a few hours and walked down suddenly anybody who saw him started bowing down to him not knowing what they're doing he knew he had to leave but before he left this was not a full moon the last full moon rasa is over but he organized an unscheduled rasa he wanted to just for once dance and sing with his people so he sang and danced and everybody knew his living rowdy just worked herself into such a frenzy of ecstasy and bliss within herself it just didn't matter to her she just transcended the normal limitations of emotion and became so ecstatic and wild eyed that nothing mattered to her so krishna went to hers he knew what it means to her so he went to her held her and he pulled out his flute from his waistband and gave it to her this flute is only for you no more flute for me never again he played flute in his life he just gave it to her from that day onwards radha started playing flute like krishna krishna never again played the flute we'll start looking at another dimension of krishna krishna as a teacher krishna is an embodiment of the divine krishna as an ultimate yogi so his whole teaching has come down in the form of gita so right now i will give you a gift of gita you don't have to read it from end to end you just read something here and there so that at least you could ask the right kind of question and we could explore his teaching to some extent you please sir gita is not just a book it's not just somebody's works if you went deep into you deep enough into yourself this is what you would speak so krishna did not choose arjuna at last he found one guy willing to sit through the whole 18 chapters that   he had to be driven to desperate moment in his life a few days earlier even our journalism imminent death and destruction then he listens there was never a time when i or you or any of these kings here did not exist and all of us shall certainly exist in future   now he's talking about life in it's essential quality not life as people so the life in front of you you cannot harm it you cannot obliterate it don't believe such things you cannot really obliterate life you are only going to put an end to this person now who is standing in front of you but he continues so do you it's always being when we say whatever you consider is divine whatever is the source of creation must be eternal isn't even from your understanding okay you don't know it i am saying even from your understanding that which is the source of creation must be eternal isn't it creation itself is not eternal it comes and goes but that which is a source of creation must be eternal so in that context he is saying don't you worry your whole business is with the physical surface whether you live if you live joyfully this physical is meaningful once you have decided wherever you are put you're only going to make misery out of it you will make anger out of it hates it out of it violence out of it it is all right to obliterate the physical but the deeper dimension of who is standing in front of you cannot be killed they have always been they will always be the same is true with you the same is true with them so do not lament about these things now a time has come when in the physical plane of reality you have to take action destruction is needed this is why if he because he is coming from this experience he was pain and hurt when people were pained he laughed with people he cried with people but now he turned himself to a different gear now he's not standing there as another human being among human beings he is standing it standing there as ultimate nature when he is standing there as a divine possibility now he speaks in a completely different tongue this same man krishna when he stood there as a human being just because a man had six wells on his back he risked his life to nurse those six wells on somebody's back you know we were looking at this in pune agenor ship but this same man now says you can slaughter this hundred thousand people don't worry it is just the body but he didn't say that when that man was in pain with six wells on his body you need to understand this when he stood there as a human being he was a fantastic human being now he's standing here as a divine possibility he's no more concerned about the physical he is just talking about let's melt the pots anyway they'll get reshaped again right now they're all cracked up no point trying to struggle with them let's melt the pots off they will anyway find their way you cannot take away the source of who they are you can only take off the surface let's do it can you see the difference in the man he sticks his life out just to nurse six wounds and somebody's back now he's willing to take hundred thousand lives with a smile on his face so you have to look at the statement from whom it is coming now anybody can repeat these words probably somewhere else it says it's alright to kill you cannot kill anybody you can neither be killed nor kill so it's okay go ahead and slaughter someone else who is not in this state should not speak these words this is why i always tell people don't read the gita because you will go according to your logical mind and it will be very convenient for all the pain and suffering that you heap upon other people after all what is there nobody dies and is he born it is okay this is true only when it's true with you also only when it is true with you also you are also beyond pain you are also beyond suffering you are also beyond life and depth only then you say these words otherwise you don't parrot these words at all it's not for you to say this when it comes from krishna it is genuine and true if somebody else just parrots these words it is utter falsehood krishna is supposed to be blue bodied maybe he was dark skinned but people who are aware saw the blueness of his energy so they went about describing him as blue you will see in the existence anything that is washed beyond your perception generally tends to be blue whether it's the ocean or the sky these are the two things which are not perceivable in normal terms anything which is larger than your perception tends to be blue because it is the basis of all inclusiveness today it's good that all of you have turned blue we will go through a certain process do we will use imagination but you need to understand everything that man has created has come from his imagination here we have the necessary energy to use imagination and make it into an absolute reality within ourselves so by the time we're done with this you must be shining blue not just clothes blue sounds of liars see let him become part of your blue in my choice has always been oh i'm lauren wow but no matter what i still my many countries up in many sweets i've had many clothes i bought but no matter what i feel for my blue sky because of this blue nature people's just fell in love with him and both men and women couldn't take it no matter what oh nah suddenly something happened in i saw with bhisma whoever it is everyone in one it was positive for me only in the presence of fingers i don't know whether she is a miracle not a miracle maker he is a miracle newsome don't miss the miracle in you appreciating his sense and intelligence and activity don't miss the miracle that's the most significant aspect of him only because he is such a miracle that type of life he lives to be devotee is a very intelligent way to live that means you're always overwhelmed with sweet emotions is it not an intelligent way to exist to keep yourself very sweet if you are overwhelmed with sweet emotions your physical body in your mind and the world around you will function at its best for you your body will offer its best to it best to you your mind will offer its best to you the world will often its best to you and what's beyond also will offer its best to you so devotion versus intelligence no devotion is very deep intelligence have you just be here this place is loaded this is not just simply a forest of trees and animals this place is loaded you don't have to imagine things you don't have to see things that you don't see just we here it has an impact on it you don't have to hear or see anything but your being will not go uninfluenced if one can simply be this art form that you will see now in many ways is the basis of the famous odyssey dancing most odyssey dancers of any caliber in their early age have been good to us they called boricuas what it would be for means is a young boy below his puberty age will dress up like a girl and do the rus like krishna and radha they're very good singers and incredible dancers and this is also a way of getting into the guru shishya parampara disciplic one slide learning about the various dimensions of his own inner nature a person who goes through this discipline for six to seven years definitely turns out as a very balanced sensible loving human being it's a very different way of transform human being yesterday someone was asking how to practice love andrews these are very acrobatic devotees you don't have to be such an acrobat to be a devotee but you definitely need the humility of those little boys to be a duty one who does not make himself important is a devotee now parvati is struggling shall i be shiva devotee er which no devotee there is no such thing all devotees are one part what he is devoted to what tools he's employing to make himself into utter sweetness within himself what does it matter he's reached the peak of sweetness within himself that's all that matters i no and i yeah you oh you you through this whole drum of all the people krishna is going to the maximum amount of drama but untouched because he said yoga stock guru karma that means first establishing yoga and then act if you act without establishing yourself in yoga then your action will become an entanglement it doesn't matter what you're doing simple things that people take up to do in their life after all for most of the people 95  of the people in the world all that they have taken a piece just to earn something for their survival procreate bring up their children that's it it is taking an unusually heavy toll simple life process it is not necessary this way but unfortunately it does go that way for many people simply because there is no playfulness in their way of existence there is no playfulness in the way they live they're too dead serious just bring little liveliness and playfulness into little activity that you do you will see make a big difference okay right now you must take this up in your life five different activities in your life simple things as soon as you go from tomorrow at least five simple activities in your life you make those simple things playful okay if you don't know how first write it down look at it whether it works without making yourself too obvious in two out of the way just a little playfulness into those little little activities just keeping something picking up something driving simple things you know five different activities you make them playful slowly it'll grow into other areas of life the seven days the way it has happened as you know all the effort has been by the volunteers they've been working for more than a month and then i have a group of them a few parameter agents any assets have been working day and night for the last two three months to get everything to its present state or both the participants and all of you and the volunteers bring some leela into your life just leela through your life that's all that matters and you just have to him the immediate playful i will handle the ultimate version if you handle the immediate in your life playfully the ultimate i will handle it for you
