and and now so i  the evening could   i said good evening  the   in  so  recover for me its of any different experience review with the coprit word on a regular basis to do you with wisdom do with nobility to do it sincerity is completely different its a very on our a aprirlige oubcorgi a of them i  i have never in the past researched when i ve gone into a talk or a conversation he is the first time that i was compaeedtotoduso  compared by the states the profundity and the intensity of sub  and then i did something that i havent done in in a curiars itedemidnotse just so that i don t make any mistakes you can make a misterastinquestionbapa agurogyi'vebeentoad that every  and every woman he be tied has come in to this word we the mission and until that mission is complete he keeps taking rebirth i dont know whether the concept of reberthistreornot but i do believe that ive one is hell with a mission how does one find out  what that mission is and what does it do to get  oh what i say may not be very pleasant what is true may not always be laderd what is letter may not be true  but why trutesamportmis the aid  pleasant things will bring solace to indoisuof people olysmeanis you re seeking somebody s help to a panel you are sychodlentiiddramma troutmins you re interested in the solution not been soles so this mission aspect all the problems on the planet is simply because everybody has their own mission and these missions had  creating what i tear conflict if all of her sitere without any mission messinminsanaumpossition of important and a gender individualatena if olifisinsirer without any individual agenda if our hearts beat just as life not as a man not as a woman not as this party or that party this religonnotdhateren she s life all of us will be very will be able to see vetecaly what is it that is most ersinsial right now and a ward  for the individual and for the larger world because every one of us have taken up this assumed missinadypositions yennoefloa of our on missions  very tludem things are being dam in the world people who even believe i mean missing is always gardnguen unfortunately you can look back on the history of human at the and see whenever somebody said god spoke to me terrible things happen a on  a recent times our president of a major nation  god told me since then or a million people are  three countries are ruined and it has bred something that you cannot can same froalygthanexthundredyears because gods folketehim so that a to many as onsenceinthis to many asamsands involved first to all thing that i have a god given mission it is an exagetatedsense of importance for the human being somewhere there is a ridiculous idea that human beings are central to the creation or the cosmos is human centric no tmorrowmoning  and that all our system it operates it will not even be noticed that is how was it is creation allies including the than and the moon and all the planets if we just iopraktomot  it will not even be no  its such a small speck this tiny speck which we call as all our system in that planet heard is a micro speck in that micro speck qalcaptar e's a super micro speck  that you  a big man  and now everybody has their own god you inmissanes whatever  horandersthings that have happening on the planet right now and made list all this wolandofthings have happening because their family believe they re doing god s work let's understand this sitting here we me  think all these are all some cavemen or nut cases from some     the adoinggord'swork that truly believe it if they did not believe it they would not be to their life for it isn't it and im manhalpictisis life  whatever he thinks is right or whatever he believes you have to at least dress he sinsyouetheboutec easy sensible  another question but is he sincere he is other as he wouldn't be is like because it is in the very intinsignaturd of life whether you are a man woman or an ant for that matter if you try to catch an ant he even to everything possible to save his life isn't it he does not think just a and life let me shed it  no no it's very vylienfor  this is the intrinsic nature of life that every life values itself for what it is  because mocthumenbengs have the nothing about experiencing the intrintialue of life right now i would say most human beings are not life the a man of thought emotion  ideas  ovinionsan buses because they have become this now they re coming up with another idea they have a garden of a mission there is no mission life is a phenomena beyond missions it is vigorthananysilylicionbecanthinkafbout it is molprofoun more organic and more phenomenal than anything human mind can ever think about missions local missions we can have but now you can have a mess  i dont want a single home in wolabawithoutelyppiri the seurloeilmissinitsfine but this is not a garden  and this is a sensible mission that you come  because so many people are living in dogness in  everybody can come up with missions like out of your sense but the moment you have a garden even mission you are a benderdintheworl  is there salvation and if so what is it sarishandrobato salvisionfhum but an vreber so you believe or anytime  the  i wonder or something if you wonder know anything any if you want to know something hello the people in upereson are you a date  or    the on a little more wall  it is it   here were the contralchalissganyou it is good  hello  so  if we are in a shot of truth the most important thing is i don't esumanyi you become a denansecer only when you realize i do not know  those who do not realize the immensity of i do not know they will believe something  the moment you believe something you get identified with it the moment you get identified with it your mind is a pliduticedmyle it will only work around that why is it so derficult for human beings to  i don't know  facom the matter you know now the elyoucimefrom where you re going  is the ninterlishold existence  now isn't it why can t i say i dont know is it okay hello  is it all right what i know i  what i do not know i do not  is it okay  but right now the tendency in the world the training in the world is whatever you do not know you believe  belief needs simple  aesocian support  you just believe something that nobody here endorses you will not go  going looking for forming your own society which believes what you believe  believe something and nobody else believes what you believe so the youopladiculesasented so you will always gathered numbers of our you the moment you gather numbers well  numbers are useful in a democratic process but numbers are not useful in seeking because a crowd cannot think  individual intelligence can seek only the longing within an individual human being is capable of seeking  crowd cannot seek anything so in many ways when you get identified with a particular belief system you would have become a crowd  you are no more an individual if you ask anybody they will  or a for example in com  he s wariincones if it s a zonrabe that i would be that is  so you have an athougiting it said it because god is nasaiditifmuspetrue  i  as he said  it doesn't matter who said it the qushchin is do you want authority to be the truth or woywandertohtobethertonic if you want to do to be the tartan  because that s the only thing that works then we must come to this much we must realize the immensity of i do not know i do not know is the basis of anowing when you truly truly realize i do not know wanting to know longing to know seeking to know and the possibility of knowing becomes a living reality otherwise you believe one thing i believe one thing i  on one part  a man of the parking prttenrearbrother when it comes merlcarcitackeachother yes a a i dont have  sadisuseeinginoughexampledtherighttroghissreetfligte living  even save at all rather  wonderful like this we respect your belief i lespecmy but when it really comes to the  we will hack to them not one thousands of times wed be doing the same i won weavenon so what you re asking is not about reinconnasion and in a way you re asking what

smtapegowasinqonrasationwithhursh he burst arnir he what he took me to madleat he he made me cross herbuistanbordermanytings but fundamentally what you are asking what is the nature of my existence if

with the without  are  lot of people believe other people die now  are i  or you and me i die not to be  we dont want i today but he idstanedoreddie so everything that you have acommeliated ibiccommininglesson that day right now if you learn tonight before you go to bed if you can sit on your bed everything that you are not everything that you have accumulated but too many to keep it as  just got a bit  i  if you sleep with this much of revnesfevrtyday one day you may wake up and light   you re on a mental a or a distance because right now if i tell you stand the nature of here  you are a  i know how it my  in a drop of but a man  i can tell you many things but the lit becomes a living experience so it is just a story isnt  stories will add color to our life but we loneringdrut and liberation troudlife your doiblttaleration  the longing for salrision is gone  then stories are only interdendment it doesn't matter whether the story came the engine culture or story came from a contemporary go it is just anterdenas but there are methods i m  i am not known to be an entertainer i do mudlthings in a pleasant manner betegruldothinks but in a pleasant manner people like it ultimately because it works  metli all the maisinthislifeis what works and what doasantworkes'tit it where that its a business in your world and my world of a  in every damn  hartenworksisutemetymaesisentn what doesnt work how we rely is doesn't deal after some time so if we had seeking savisionif  dont see are  test instead of waiting for that day when you will sit on your bed bit and one what is this all about  tonight you sit on your bed and wonder what is this all about lip you come down to reality right now you re running away with your psychological drama to such an extent the existential is completely missing  if you pay attention  s  constantly be aware of your mortal nature that means you know you shall also die this is not a negative that  means your time will get organized in a most sensible man when you know you re on a limited leash of time your time in get organized in a most sensible manner  our conscious that you will also die and it could be any day or a we planning on his many years but nobody here has come with a galandecard have you   so it could be today i feel conscious of this do you have time to do anything that doesn'ttuleavemattetoyou you will do only what really matters  when every human being is doing only what truly to you matter to them this is a good iful god  right now they do in crow my retes  being a very deep cricket to entheseaste and now somewhat in world with the sport i see with the admiration rise and rise and rise of it at core  he is enitaeonfthefieldi  hinityoftefeld i see  he s transforming and rewriting the rules of the game  the dearentiformet one forty to one sixty was a score he s real to find it no one ninetiissefpot to a fifty to fifty to to  there is something within him that propels in more than others there are many people who are talented a people who have the civility but then a few who realize the sevilit or is it that big one to realize he can do a little more  he can inspire more  the concledmore we can create vewlstandars is there something from with  or is it something from outside what is it i also in watingwithtotcally with interest because  i have seen every great batsman in the last for the foretepaeis you have hip them all away his hitdingit probably the only other person that i can think of is the ambecereh  to hit the ball igtis but he did not have the sense  end of mission that this boy as  he is play for finelandyunow an island celebinculter and he kind of didnt take it so seriously or did not go at it with the sun  i with this boy is going  but i think he was the only one who was striking the  a way this boy striking to the which is ready  most people who watched only cricket on the television don't understand this probably its one of the most danedhis games on the planet a hard ball is coming at you over hundred and thirty and forty cilimetusprwer and this is the only sport where the molistpitce and it swings this way that way wisugivesyouafraction of a second to makerdusision how to handle a ball it it's a very vantalusgeme you must do you know the bowling i see the may be there in a kolkata yes the bowling machines are there young men and telling gontdryanfordincilimtis at eighty or ninety element  just make set the mollingmesinatlantyclimates and stand there and see how the whole conseyuit's crazy okay  so every bodies different the waits coming at you so it needs to be handled everybody who is there we must understand is very good they may look clumsy they may get out for zero but very good with what they doing but somebody stands out like this this aman of a there was a moticitolriderwas non  was name was canyerobor  one the worltanponshipsfivepamdinarop people couldn't believe it because you have  win sixteen races across the country to get to the temponship all that my sense to prevent by the top companies and the palanes of the high level but winning five in a row was considered unprecedented an impossible so the asking  no  so he said  i go out of control with control i andetenderwerhywells i live every step of my life like that was out of control but with control  this is what everybody seeking they want little madness in their life but the dorntago insane but their longing for safety in sick  he makes them insulate themselves from that little madness then they wonder what's happened to my life it s become boring and no good the glidofdepr then they get hit by something the again willwaledon them this process is going on so when you take an example like this one thing is the zeal and the thing is loving what you re doing really loving what you re doing that s what you do  this ones happen i was just walking on it the tiny out for  and the indian horetene was leaving for germany for tampinstroffy that he  a few years ago the de not get them came an spent  well we contendes in the  and we had helped the previous team  i was a going so when i walked in keepiousgie was the by some  so i must come and speak to the voice we have a cycholigtiswisspeakingto them right now in the arplrjus before lilinforgeman many of these boys have never gone out  the country for the first time they go  and half the team was a from the driblnbeh because they all came out the tape at caerning so the i went there to see what the doing so this ichllotistisofindapepdtemup is a telling them i conpropiditcanande is selling then  your parenishovedrought you up  now to bring pride  one million people on the full by a is watching  you have cannot disappoint them i  it arlayninenyerroldboys from the plate  one million people that expectation and their parents honor there dursdeyislete so they assmentospeak  and see i asked them do you badtonowpoudoclyop i aftenteringthesdictander i play hopelattomyschoolenndsqolet so i said  you go do you know how to play  the side  i said  ugassdonnoowtheploep as a not so  i began  i know how to lyrhoppi then if you know the leaf  this is all you  to seventy minutes the ball must be continuously the ball that you go you want the ball to y constantly in opasitgo don't tradtoweatgermaniandpackistanandsombody  somebody just put the ball in the goal  you like to do it isn't it  yes we like to do it so just to that for to get the word bored and your parents and everybody  for some time and  last one of these conversations i had in it  one of the film active his final question is  all this is okay but in  how the weatpukiston i said the  you should not try to beat back is  you should just learn to hit the ball they did not tacasenintheborewoialright you just have to hit the ball you dont have to beat pakistan if you play to beat pakistan with us to pudtheimocians you will do something stupid which has been happening continuously now  i think recently without only came on the television and said  only problem is i get angry i want to be like a monk something he had  his own wosionof being  to come  i think he needs balance with the kind of talent i has if he learns to become balanced he is going to be a phenomena is going to be a  olcricketingstoryandtheblanet not this one mola he has the necessary in god  i said this when i was seven  i saw him line and in a war  for the anderaiengtemor something i was  in the teartaotiei  this boy playing and then on the  sgivingifarmo and then he vanished out of my eye or almost five  and then i sufficesevenlyonedayinthedis i i nameemdeed and now he s going the way is on  needs to balance himself if he learns to be a cool fire not a fire that and him up then he rildlings which probably has not been done for a long time i think we can give him those tools of self transformation which will not take away the fire so that are two ways to fire yourself if i get angry i can propel myself  this is one way but all of you know whenever you re angry you propels you at the same time  taesalyyoursense in manuase it takes over your capability she and shoe you sintiffically madicallywecanshoyou how your system is getting poisoned in your engry is of being that way ithsurepleasantnessyoucandrivyourshep you do not know how  see there is the  we have been driving interthelccompesein engines for a long time which i in smoking and polluting and killing  in many ways but to be propelling  now we are coming to engines which has no internal conbesion which mouldlydriswih  nice with  so without  in red  coming to that  coming off a oehatmabilf levledstimecomenity comes of age that and to propel yourself in a vererlasantmanne i am on so on to entyaic  and as follinganoum why we need anger this and that if out of sense you can drive yourself it is not necessary you have to drive yourself with anger or hatred   those things give you energy in a certain way but they take away your competence in many lens this boy needs tools for self ganfomation i think we should deliver that to him  i would like to do that to him because she is the penomeninewateg yes yes if poderedynokman i mean he can be a much big of an omen  toughtobeofitalelonhaone a phenominavildeforegoden   is to become  yes in cricket you deal with a lot of celebrity  it s a fool yolloftarmengcomselefitis and do a epegoes and when you see the game from within you see how large he goes up  and a to the outside  the evil doesn't overtake the interests of the  but sometimes it does how does one as an or no draw a line between balancing the ego and the interest of the deep so if you if  will a celebrity he's not oustoathesa  that your t lose  if you do  because of his eagl sometimes romesicianstatacon so how does one balance this this is not disancricked this is  and i  you give somebody to do something then do it for three days they are erreachlatoseryoukno  if they do something get little thtecoadmition  fibretlglapthehends their advice fopildefaltherdon't realize this is not the way to liclicet ive in the ariocomle you got to be on the  so a how to be with it there are many ways  the best way i is not that we dont demwihit when an i have i dont deal with it the need tools for self transformation what has happened with them is just this they are still driving them  because of the euforiaticcrowd what is it in in the newspaper what other people are saying about you on another  you have not found anything about yourself you  at a product of other people to opinion everybody saying your great and  not believing your great no you don't have to believe any  if you good at something  have to keep on seeing how to nhanstet it is this is the problem with people they think bememamitious ambition means you re tweaking your desire in s of taking your competence you tweaking your desire which is just the wrong widordolife you dont need to be a michifs you don t need to think i have the sport undredvants  need to think i have to become a  you ll just have to hit the ball at coming at you right now that  i took for the you  of course nitlaining that a different  without that you wudtacomehere you just need the necessary alertness and presence of mind to do what you have to do at that moment  instead of that they ve become  your reputation will not play it s only if it to  tinswichlace epuditiencootla so by the time they realize this many of them are less down because they under crop coming up doing things i think these boys you know because without other expose without genterlywith education they just coming sadentothegame and the folligivedthemseles to the game before they know what's happening quite lost many of them  all of them  mahyordwithtaga others have gotten lost with again if theyre even little education about how to handle themselves i think they come out on the tops create i do not how to define  but i would  in my own cilly'scupidwarei would find greaders unlimited irrational desire no  deliglatedliketiswa i want is need what you want is greed  then the me the i is defined gliadithe strong word we dont have to go to this why greed is a consequence of a certain and fulfilstate when i say consequence for saidnanprupi what is a human being longing for every game  all of you wherever you are right now you would like to be little more than what you re right  isn't it so hello  yes  that little more happens what  little  that happened what  so it looks like  instulmentsyouaregoing towards something how much more would seadlyofomgood let's look at it right now  bored in installments how matamowresadlo i love  if i make you the king or queen of this solar system don t look at me it hope  i m not known to ceminseatoblondors even if you become the king or queen of this all our system you will not be for  we look at the stars because this is the nature of the human being there is something within you always longing to expand in a boundless way because you have gotten so we identified with your physical form you re trying to find this boundless way to physical means when we say physical let's understand this physicality can exist only because of a defined box if it is in a bar there is no physicality possible you can say something is physical only if it has a defined bama otherwise it cannot be physical  so through something  physically the wordlounins through the world of valars you re trying to reach towards boundlessness this is like you re driving your ommeserarcori and fortunatelaggonsyto many on the colcetororzenema you are living on batedepar but you want to go to the moon you may call beyond the on sometimes the you try heart but you will not go to the  because to go to the moon you eat a different kind of wecico altogether so you re seeking boundlessness unconsciously so you re trying to go towards boundlessness to physical means when it finds very basic physical expression you wanting to be more than yourself repoldtisecualit all you re trying to do is something that is not you you re trying to make it a part of yourself for a few moments if it finds emotional expression we all this love something that is not you you want to ingtingatdasapart of yourself if it finds a mental  it gets labeled as greed ambition conquest or simply shopping if it finds a quantiousepress we call this yoga yougamensouniou you go means you successfully you is the boundaries of your individuality because the boundaries of your individual nature are essentially your making when i say sisuntilyormaking a i not let to say you re sitting here unfortunately somebody that you don't like you would enemy happened to settle down in the chair next to you out in front of you  you constan you re softingsitingther because this horrible person is sitting next do what with  no no no  you are mind cannot take it but your body has no you what the ice you d in hellingunponciouslybut not probe  yes a certain  your body has no problem  this life has no problem only your mind has problem because your mind recognizes the boundary your body doesn't reccoodnise the box you sit here and breathe what you re callettrisulinhal what the tree i exceloateinhemg a real you look at it one out of your lungs is hanging out there yes your life is not happening separately it is happening as a one whole thing you just a pop up from this planet you know you have seen those pop upon  and our computers can  if they re padonlyfortoseconds ad  this pop up for tusicindsandbook in the life of this planet you re just a tusicandpopup and you a boat yes so   so this four doesn't understand its just  popurithinksidedonkno its boundaries of a tennis you must get this now these boundaries are all made by you if you really fix the boundary you can read then you ll diliteno it is a transaction which is giving you a lot so this sense of vanary he is wanting you to expect because you know only physicality you trying to kspanphysically esembodyexpansefaster than you you say he is greedy if the if you are expanding faster than somebody  you think you are successful what stimulates or motiitsaligl you've got the a minesthingsodeyarslhire right of the top what are its them to a tie more you re essentially asking what drives  yes if they re driven by something they shouldnt be leading anything in my opinion when you die you re not driven you are driven then you re a leader if you re driven by something then you re also a  but you have a bunch of slaves behind you whether your ambition drives you will you go you a mission i  all you live  or whaterulddlivso if something is driving you  in mylepini i wouldn t call that person a leader nothing life i met like this i really have no need for action if i close my eyes and sit here  considtueylafollive really  ansinplissit i ve sentlynoreed for action but all the time on on people think i have a is  there is no mission i see an enormous longing in people around me i see needed  so i do what i can  eitplecalledthis all kinds of  is a sodgosduindthe or so  even days  can i do this  m be having god talking to him every day  no this is just this if you display a content o this every human being is capable of knowing this the very body the to cat  you created from inside that is an intelligence here  that is a conpridenchea which is capable of transforming a piece of bread into a complex mesine call humenmaghinson this is the most complex piece of technology on the planet you egrividme  those of you at engrustwityourformstemmastin this is a more complex piece of technoledg this you re capable of making with the piece of bread or a mango or a fish or whatever you eat now if you can tap into this intelligence even if a drop of this intel  this vithianmakebreadintobadionl in to conscious excess suddenly lihervicomemagical this is whatever him and being has to do because the highest form of intelligence is it  not here  either cross right now we re mistaking intellect for intelligence intellect is like a knifeitcutsthrughfwo things it helps to it sairdvavr but it doesn t sure you the nature of life it doesn't give you except to life in fact it chops of eviling if you have a youdintlectoomuch to anything in eve in everything its self up it's it's a good insimentfordasac when you want to know something so  of  do they all assinestothento antively become disexon this works okay when you re doing some maeilsta but now you wonder now your mother very well so you die  no  this is not the way   this is not the way yumuscieyoua instrument of disixionnassie and see how to brave and include somebody only then you know them  they section you may see that level give me lee but you want now that piece of life in any context isn't it so the problem is death  that  think a leader means emma  floanshouting fire  no i think leadership has to mature in your plate a leader must be someone wistansindbusiesolrneeds there is nothing driving him then he will do what is needed this is what i m trying to create with every human being in the world  as you are no more in the set of happiness you re blissed out by your own nature when you're not invisutofwihappeness you are no more a wester interest in the world you know what is needed  then you are in the should have happiness  i do this i will find happen  if i do that i will get fulfillment if i get this i got from  venudingsatestat noinelyanunnoing  you are a vested interest noyinglyaruno will cause much harm people may not realize that right now ounadiions later people look back and say i look at the things they did in the past but if you are joyful and blissful by your own nature your intelligence ill function in a completely different way you will do just what is needed another thing is you are free from the fear of suffering only and only when you re free of fear of suffering  was dried fistriver in your life on the wise  i step is a half a step what will happen what  after what  a  whatever happens this is how i will be if this assurance comes to  then you would explore your life in many many way then you are doing right now i sent  this one thing must happen for every  this is the reason why last twenty years we ve been focusing on the leadership in the world put it  a business guroocratically  all kinds this is about the two  tininsiwl someone the adrominent person came to the the over sen  and they went to the nandeingprogram i said  this is frientas but what able denetion so i told him see i have a clear  i have listed out two thousand people i am not talking about a  ftersichiefministers because they come on go on the life of a democratic llythatmevbyfiveyerscartenians  some must a little longer but genilytatoligas but then are under the set of leaders business leaders elocraticlythes so leaders who a dear for the solid twenty five thirty of space many is the of the people  who ultunently are the legs for any political if they are the people who actually deliatethegods so  i see i have a list of two thousand  you get me is two dozen people in the next four years you will see in the next  as you lose a significant panpemision in the country we ve been going at it  nearly fortintiftinyers idthing now  think we have touched about forty two to forty three percent of this leadership and they re making a quiet difference i am here witkelvfor the same purpose not good to be one thing  one of my closest friends wives and a very bad back problem and now she is doing you all  no it seems she will be able to vote such  and she will get cured hopefully by you  how do i tags scinece which enedis body to the hut of the country the youth of any nation has some level of  tality and some level of confusion but right now the youth in india in many waraccrossroades they do not know cultil what they want to fall this way or that way it has successfully here no tratdlehatowords look at her in looks but to the rock singer of  so a this the on stutdling how do you know  i dont know whether to get totally westdeniveosta and somebody is by the somebody is india and  it's a confusion for the youth or you means it is humanity the making and terrible things have been happening in the country in our country so many things are happening in this what  happening to children and it is a great one because it seems in the last one  seventeen hundred children below sixteen years of age to comactidseesideof this country when to them started commenting susie we need to one  and we are doing something fundamentally wrong something wearethyfindamentallyrong when children below sixteen years of age commit to decide in such numbers we need on a pan with grave concern that fundamentals are not being handled properly  heard this number about four months ago then i told our people this year for the yoga  i must thats ten thousand schools we must teach you ran ten thousand schools the  but what theyve got mustoudhisdicedas i ask herisene ten thousand looklikamidbignumberformonthsago then i just traveled eight as a at the ti ministers of every state but all of them came with such antozeston  today we have made  with his eight  and the mind state is coming through now it is going to cross that the thousand schools we  we have in forty five thousand six hundred teaches or into willplaimsreteatosineviry school and this is not a one day thing  i  ape as a part of this schoolceroclum jistrandiminisedec simple form of what it or i will pay you  olaminsitsubyok if you teach you  there are seraeinadamatusthat you must plintin because it doesn't matter how innocuous a our gepracisedlooks every one of them has a spiritual dimonsent  simply the way you sit where youre it has without those timintensiyou  it would be responsible so we took this upa you  and which doesnt have a pirlitulsidetoit  purely for their physical and ptycholeticle well being  it is so of immense  and the country we are probably touching somewhere around seventeen to eighteen million children  tointendto sixteen years of age  said we have chosen but this is tilivdropthethoshon this is not a total solution this needs to happen in a much later skill  my commitment ease did all of homrussdioteethtoday  those if we not sang in it in case  you resurtyd  because the tools for keeping your dental hygiene are with you  supples it was in the hands of the gorelant with an otherbeniz  the pogresses't  you have to come every the and ive besu i am sure many of you would miss it because the fur in  now everybody has the tools of the tenterligte similarly every human being should have the tools of self transformation in their hands it should not be in the hands of a good  or an organization or some of the kind of  is that is been  every human being must have access to this with this intent wyrdwigmanitings fortunately i consider  so in all my car  i was taking somewhere and i said  so who is the greatest go in the  i said of course me  my crisis  this is me i m the god is  they said what vedteciicoi   when a cwisnaking or a graceful and fantastic he was if he spoke the gentle being that he was  is for maybe fifty people heard  those behind did not yet when i go to a the booddarcame he was little more you know he did not desamehisthiticproblongsastrishn  he was more committed towards his mission so meehisolitlod hundred people now  today we have come to a world where we can sit here and tap go a billion people if you want at once so when this kind of situation has  a time has come where everybody should have access to it it should not be limited to organizations go  go  this that every human  as they know how to keep the map  they must know how to keep themselves  the necessary tools must be made a viable of a commitment is just to offer the tools no  is not believe system no idea  is no forming of one more new religion but every human being should  have the tools and there must know how to use it today it is possible before this was a  today hispossis very often a public display of simplicity this is taken was i  said and it's regarded as a virtue hades one actually impress upon people that it is not a display of simplicity that  important but  simplicity of thought  simplicity of virtue that is more important  the ficiatesimplicity of thought i think we need a more sofhestigetiancomplexi that it of an i simplicity of but do we want to become a one and on the modicalfimilybu  that's not the idea of being human this entire simplicity business has come from wedinmidocomynes saying and saves after pass we should look at them they lived in accordance to the times in which they lived someone  i have  whatever that womwaiadoed with a sedan involvement and passion so i drive in a certain way to one dernnlis comes to me  yogis always walked across this country you are driving by you  what kind of a yogi  i said  it thousands  not justiovis in what he was walking  made  everybody was walking so he was ontoawocking now if i walk and go you and  see what a fool he is if i eat i i i  driving  i ecomemorestorthetulif i have if i have a sharp or do in care so right now that is this thing thats viitualepe some kind of a disability  because if it is bilitoeandshital first thing they will ask who is water the things you cannot do  they will not ask you what are the things you can do  oh i took it upon myself  countries they had a lot of people nobody can figure what i am i m many things at the same time i m rivanancompertedterasing a i m a licensed lodlriving pilot i m a lisestdiwer and many many things  cuspitetolothy'sempowerment it is not a disability the reason one most people have rejected pirituality ease because some people projected the idea if you dress  if you eat  and if you live badly you must mispilitu this hastortange this has to change everybody needs to understand or you  what you wear where you live is a qusetienoughyourrecque and ynysthedic you are within yourself is your spirituality enctestoffixinglaindegorit you re fixing the padefevelovarnallia  you re fixing your clothing  so if you just at a small piece of cloth around your lines you will not become spiritual if that  the like that is over you like  you want to keep your life that simple it's up to you  but unfortunately people are impressed by this not the should go  astabl so i think in many ways in a werehycondearialwayihae set up an example for this that you now do not do a can and me wanted to come out with the i do the clothes i  that i read it it and by me  ilteredthesignverto other people a  and the she looked at my chosen  a gleyoldthebesttrestman in the world thednomonnon said yes lelyiave never seen anybody with your sense of color exteranstuff  misanclotestogether i said okay you want we on  we let the design something but he said i dont know how to design men s clothes i said what's the problem  the womans lots  in more obsience and moleaiitythere  i don t get the time to do it with fopildotomdas so this idea of simplicity has destroyed many things at certain times said to people somebody who lived in the jungle dressed in a certain way but even they when they came to the city in those days whatever was formal they wore those things peoples idea of piritrelityareyourisandsans a i think these elogieswhofollownoutofthecalanolemetus ok  re getting on in time this can go on  but it's time to take questions from the audience we ritactogrestians i take the magiponanmawhip we re you  liaforerycomety  i was a emsecnomuscaemsaidgoodom speaking of gods and gods  and so  eating of god then god  that is a lavtoleatwithtegadandtogama that reading lane of my said you had alsopatinmyseserilinkofhervysfeet what is the connection and this was in a kin of day sling the deman and why on the think of eryfossoand you and we in tockabourdthatscompsinandgodite  she is bringing us to the gods  i want you to mentally give yourself up for this i wanted to understand  and this culture is a godless culture never before ever in this country have we projected the god any time they always told you your life is your karma that means your life is your making  everything that you are in the consequence of what you do to you  the ponsciousliorunconsciously if you do a conscious leveleanountheveryeoneict if you do it unconsciously and or some other way and you think something did it to you  so venwy said its your come he meant that you are the maker of your life but gods and gods and gods and say  also  no  a that telatecedly million gods and goddesses this tie a million happen when our population was taken to a million since then we got in latin shy of creating gods because people from outside came without understanding the sinesantechnoligy of god making they said no one you no moterhanguardsfyerdworeshipping that s not of it is  the only an guard everybody made of the  somehow forgotten but we know  a big difference making up the god does not mean just in maine something that s how it happened in hilliyaof  swithindisscuntureveevwalldetechnoligy of godmaking when i said technology have god making i dont know if this word is alive in me  but in the south the deities also ever to as a young  is a bit no is a of  gene  is the deity also effortoaseantera well im not in deafosorey it is  i  okay and so its very much alive you must understand the word yantra means a mess  on a farm that we are  why do i cleadmishs why did we come up with the base  we can

now because we can speak we have come up with a micraform come with the telephone we are coming all kinds of forms because we can see i came with the micro  ptellescolwonmanykinds of scopes every

we can be setildeare we have a telescope we can see here he for we can speak here but you wouldn t hear  so we have a miccrfar now we are speaking to then at home to everything every missing is only

is a difficult thing  it  in uneducated takes a lot more i cause from the first day you are one you are been any other or teachers its brief  all kinds of people everybody is busy teaching you

if there is a reaiginssocthisstie i like  if you wonder hiksep something as a oliosad you think excellence also is oulembeson ambition means you had taken your desire desire me not we treat your competence to be treated taking the competence nobody can come in the way because you re doing something with yourself ocompretansiletisa certain level of excellence others will stand by and watch anyway when you spin them out you and the baton wistandandotce his wicket'svolgo  because it is a set of excellence so excellence is not something that you do with the world  elenstheis something that you do with yourself suppose you re managing large situations the as an organ a  then it in all  many inwondhevideby it is a certain aspect so the problem is i always either looking up to some  or looking down on something this is something we must understand this is one thing all of you should do that   don t look up to anything  look down on anything if you just  it is not simple it's not a simple as it sounds because the moment you say something  you look up to it the moment you say something is bad look down on it just bring this equanimity  you dont look up to something you  look down on something you look at everything just the way it only if you see life death awayites can you conducted to the best of your ability if you think something is  it gets exaggerated in a positively if you think something is  it gets exagiated in the negative  the moment you exagedit something in your mind you are not seeing things the way they are once you don't ten things deer the are excellence will be of another world it will you was never tetet so people are not in the way of your exelly nobody is  is just that you are treating excellence as an ambition no excellentisselftranformision

nothing happens like this you must understand this in some way any one aspect if something is happening which is genion the  your mind can deceive you in a million different ways  if something in it

oullakyyotisobrtenity to just say this that it is it is wonderful and a sulyhartening to see that across the world  today the business leadership is beginning to look at the in a dimension not in

live in the world of bone and get hugely empowered you re bound to create some kind of a conflict which is destructive in nature pardiglatly the business leadership to them because there was a time when the religees leadership on the planet as the mostinfliiallatship but then the military masingsan the world in the world it up then the milureliadersbekamethemostinflentulatos but in the last hundred years the democratically elected leaders have become most powerful but a time coming in the next fifteen to twenty five years you will see the economic or the business leaders will rule the world in many ways but the business leaders unfortunately have a tag are on the neck saying that the western  they are here just to make money it is a time a wonderful happening that a whole lot of business leaders are looking towards via  i this man speratorliy does not mean going to the  all going to heaven no it means moving from a world or a dimengin  boundaries to a dimension of boundless
