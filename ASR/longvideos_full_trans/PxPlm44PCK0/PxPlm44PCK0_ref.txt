 the business of introducing sadhguru jaggi vasudev  who s been described in many different ways in my profession  by people from my profession  we ve called you a maverick   we ve called you a monk on a motorcycle  we ve called you a glamorous  flamboyant guru but for your devotees you are simply sadhguru  and yet sadhguru  at a time when faith seems to be in collision with so many other questions that come up as a matter of individual liberty  i think this will make for a very interesting and important conversation for our times  so i would like to thank you for being part of this conversation  let me start with the spiritual and i hope what you say today is also addressed to the skeptics  i count myself among a skeptic  who if told that another human being possesses some sort of godly power  i would perhaps as the first instinct  not believe it but what i find interesting about what you ve s some of your sayings  as captured by arundhati subramaniam in this book  is that you re actually saying that what we experience beyond our five senses  anything that we experience beyond the five senses can be called god  can be called power or can be called yourself  so if god doesn t necessarily exist  why do we need gurus  why do we need sadhguru    do you drive in delhi   do i drive   mhmm    unlike you  i have a fear of wheels    so if you drive in an unknown terrain  yes    you use these days a gps   yes   usually  a strange woman will tell you   turn right  you turn right  she says   turn left   you turn left  she says   make a u turn  you make a u turn   why  simply because you are you re not familiar with the terrain  when you are in an unfamiliar terrain  it is sensible to take instructions    so are you are you saying gurus are the new gps    not new  not new  long time ago we ve been   for a very long time  way before the gps came   gps means what   guru positioning system    but you know  i have to say that while i don t drive  i ve often sat in the car and heard that girl s voice on google maps and often google maps  you can actually  you can actually   does not  does not adv does not give you the right advice   you can change it to a man s voice if you wish   okay   this beginning of this conversation perhaps underlines that you are atypical  you are atypical of what we imagine gurus to be  we expect people who don t crack jokes  we expect people who don t have a zest for life  somehow  all of our spirituality has traditionally been centered around giving up  around abstinence of some kind  around abstaining from pleasures  from denying creature comforts  why do you believe that the material can co exist with the spiritual   it s  it s not that i believe  it s only because you have a body which is your physicality  you have a life within  if you did not have a body  if you re disembodied  i m not going to talk to you  because with disembodied beings you don t have conversations  okay  i know people  people do talk to ghosts   people are trying to do that these days   because they re not on talking terms with the living   they choose the dead  because you can make the dead speak whatever you want  the living will speak what they want  it s a big problem   it s a very serious problem in a conversation because i will say what i want to say if i was dead  you can make me say whatever you want to say   but can an  because you can do both sides of the conversation   but if your philosophy you hate the word philosophy i know if your technology of inner engineering and we ll talk more about that in just a moment is available to all of us to  in a sense find strength within ourselves  sadhguru  then does that mean that the atheist and the agnostic and the skeptic can also embrace spirituality  is inner engineering only for those who believe or is it for anyone  who asks questions   the previous question is a loaded one  still not answered fully   yes  i know   i haven t i haven t given up on it yet    coming to this  see you re putting atheists and agnostics and skeptics together it s a wrong classification  atheists and theists are together  they re one kind   because they both have certainty   both  both believe something that they do not know  both are not sincere enough to admit that they do not know  this is the biggest problem  the biggest problem in the world is people are still not straight enough to come to a place   what i know i know  what i do not know i do not know  because they have not realized the immensity of  i do not know   i do not know  is the basis of longing to know and seeking to know and the possibility of knowing  the moment you destroy  i do not know  you destroyed all possibilities of knowing  so this is atheism and this is theism  they re not different  they re in the same boat  they pretend to be different  one believes positively  another believes negatively but they both believe something that they do not know  one  person  a well known person in the country who goes about claiming he s an atheist all the time  one day comes up to me  somebody just introduces me first time  i said  namaste' he says   do you know  i believe there is no god  i said   i don t even believe that     do you mean javed akhtar    i  i m not  that was a good imitation  so i guessed   it wasn t difficult   i am not  taking names  i am saying the thing is you also believe something  you don t seem to understand that  the most important thing is to come to this place of being utterly straight and sincere with life   what i know i know  what i do not know i do not know  if you come to this much  if you closely pay attention to everything around you  you will see with all this scientific exploration  we do not know even a single atom in its entirety  that s the fact   so what is it that you know sadhguru   why are millions of people your devotees because you just said that honesty   they usually don t   is about admitting  they  they don t claim that they are my devotees  you know   what do they say then   hmm   what do they say then   usually they claim they re meditators  volunteers  and stuff    okay  volunteers then   but there must be something they think that you know because you just said that life is actually about admitting what you don t know  the corollary to that is there are things that you do know  we do know we re sitting at the habitat center amphitheatre at this moment in delhi   that we know  what beyond this sadhguru  do you know and what do you not know   i ve asked you like is there a question of  now  what do i know  i don t know anything except this one   i know this piece of life from its origin to its ultimate  everything that i need to know about this life  i know  and i see every other life is actually the same thing  if you look deep enough  so in that context  because today modern science is coming to this  there is a  a theory which is evolving  which is called as constructional theory what they are beginning to say is whether it s an amoeba or a grasshopper or a earthworm or a bird or an animal or an elephant or you or me or the whole cosmos  the fundamental design is same  it is only a question of complexities and sophistication of the same design  so this is something always the yogic science has been saying  that if you know  you know anda you know pindanda   you know  if you know the atomic  you know the cosmic because the fundamental design is same  it s only a question of complexity and sophistication of what s happening  so fundamentally  if you know this piece of life  you know everything by inference   but when you say this piece of life  do you mean yourself  do you mean this moment  what do you mean by this piece of life   you are a piece of life  aren t you  are you life or are you media    are they mutually exclusive   are have  mediums  that s why i m saying    i would hope i m a flesh and blood person unless somebody knows better    flesh and blood you gathered  isn t it   yes   what you call as my flesh and blood  you slowly gathered over a period of time  if this much accumulation of flesh and blood  this much impressions have to be gathered  there must be something more fundamental  isn t it   do you think of yourself as a yogi  a mystic or a guru   i ve not wasted time thinking about myself    what would you rather be thinking of   i don t think usually  really  for me  see th  this whole thing  because of the type of very mediocre education that s being delivered today  we have raised thought to heaven unfortunately  thought is a simple thing  i know this is against everything that you believe in because you are also a believer    no   believer in thought   yeah   yes   i believe in being able to ask questions   yes   that s what i do for a living   oh   that s good   so i must believe that it is possible to ask questions   you  you ask questions for a living  my life is full of questions   now  now the thing is what you call as thought is coming from the limited data that you have gathered from the experience of your life  every person is the same thing  how much ever we have gathered  it s still too small compared to the size of this cosmos and the way the phenomena of life is happening  from this limited da  data  you can recycle things and generate thought  or in other words  nothing new ever happens  same permutations and combinations of the same thing will go on forever  the essence of what we re teaching in the name of inner engineering is to engineer yourself in such a way  every moment of your life is a new possibility  if it has to become a new possibility  what is needed is perception  when i say perception  people think opinions  no  i am talking about perception  as you see here   similarly enhancing your perception so that you perceive life  right now when we say thought  emotion  we re talking about expressing life  expression is not so important  once in a way we can express but perceiving it is important because this phenomena is too fantastic  it s not a small thing  the greatest phenomena that s happening here is life itself  so if you want to know this phenomena  the only way you can know  the only doorway for you to know life is yourself  see  right now can you see me   yes  i can   can you can you use a finger and point out where i am   oh  you re wrong  you know i m a mystic from south india   now this light is falling upon me  reflecting  going through your lenses  inverted image in the retina  you know the whole story  where do you see me now   still in the same place   no   i do   you see me the way i m projected in the firmament of your mind  you cannot see me here  in the very nature of your visual apparatus  where do you hear me right now  within yourself  where have you seen the whole world  within yourself  now if there is a grasshopper here  he doesn t see me the way you see me  he sees me differently  he sees the whole world differently  now you  you can think   oh  he s no good  this is the fundamental problem that we think his perception is no good  no  no  his perception is very good for his survival  your perception is very good for your survival but it s not good enough to know the nature of life   but i  so now   what do i know  means i have enhanced enhanced my perception the way it is important to know the nature of life  not just for survival   but if inner engineering as a spiritual technology is something that works  i ask you again  why do we need gurus  because that means the answers are within us   you re speaking so much language  did you learn a  b  c  d  i think so   do you remember when you re four years of age  that damn  a  how complicated it was   yes   two versions to it  you had to write it a hundred times to get the damn  a  today you can close your eyes and write  so it doesn t matter how simple something is  without a certain guidance  could you have picked up a  b  c  i m asking  no  similarly  when something new you have to approach  if you don t have the right kind of guidance  you won t pick it up   tell us a little bit about yourself  your story is well chronicled but what is of interest to people is that you started off as  i haven t read that book  i don t know  i hope she s written nice things about me    she s written a very brilliant  arundhati s  subramaniam has written a very brilliant  very brilliant book   no  she s brilliant but what s she written about me    one of the things that she has said is that you give great space for dissent  you like a good argument  that you re not an  you re not one of those dictatorial gurus    i don t know where is a dictatorial guru  i think the  most people have not met a guru  they have just seen calendar images and made conclusions  i don t think they have met any genuine guru  there are a whole lot of people who should have been temple priests who are good entrepreneurs and they ve become gurus today   that s different  okay    temple priests  no  no  see    who have become good entrepreneurs   no  i m saying  just another word of way of saying they re charlatans   that s a strong word  maybe that s enterprise   i am not a enterprise  so because i am not an enterprise  i want everybody to ask whatever the damn question they have  it doesn t matter how ridiculous or how intelligent  how nonsensical it is  it doesn t matter  if the question means something to you  it means something to me  it doesn t matter how brilliant it is  if it doesn t mean anything to you  i am not willing to listen to it   but you re saying that many  many people are  who are positioning themselves as gurus are really only elevating themselves and fooling people  i ve   no  i didn t say  okay  i m saying that   i m saying   but   the thing there is there is a vacuum  somebody is trying to fill it   yes  and sadhguru  you have been  are they qualified to be that  questionable thing   but a very genuine concern and you have been on some of my television programs where we have spoken about this   is whether god men are often con men  and how does this lady here  know the difference between who s a god man and who s a conman and is a human being capable of being a god man  do you think of yourself as a god man    why are you underestimating that lady    okay  let it be my question   how do i spot the difference between a god man and a con man if i don t even believe that humans can be godly  i think humans can be brave and wonderful and inspiring and but i don t think that they have magical powers   see  did you ever see god having magical powers   no  i ve never seen god   no  then why are you saying he must have magical powers   so first of all  this god man is essentially a media coined word  nobody claims that he is a god man  okay  some are goddamn men  that s different   nobody i don t think anybody has personally claimed   i am a god man  i have not met anybody like that  now  that is a that s another kind of profession  putting labels on everybody  you know   leaving that alone  what is it  this is a culture   you must understand this  it s unfortunately all mixed up today this is a godless culture  you must understand this  there has never been an idea of a god in this culture  only in competition with what came from outside  because we saw they could rule us  they were dominant and we thought we have to imitate their ways  we also started making it up to some extent  not successfully though  yes  but we know the technology of god making  when i say technology we are using the english word  god  but that word doesn t exist in india  here we call them devas  what a deva means is see today media is projecting tendulkar as a cricketing god  it s very appropriate to this culture because if somebody excels beyond a certain level in any field he may be a sportsperson  he may be a warrior  he may be an artist  he may be anything   if he excels beyond what normally average human beings think is possible for them  he goes  they recognized him as a deva and he s worth looking up to because he becomes a guiding light for them  that ll anyway happen  whether you like it  you believe it  you don t believe it   sure   in every field  somebody rises  he becomes the light for the rest of the people   yes   so similarly  in the inner spaces when i say the inner spaces  the quality of your life is not determined by what kind of house you live in  what clothes you wear  what car you parked outside  what things  jing bang happening around you  no  this moment how joyful  peaceful  blissed out you are within yourself  now if i sit here  we re sitting here in the same space  breathing the same air  probably we ate the same kind of food i don t know what you eat  but if i sit here now with my eyes closed  the way i am within myself  i will not exchange this  for anything in the universe  now  when people see  no matter the number of things i m managing is insane  everybody thinks   sadhguru  is it possible  you must go crazy someday  all volunteers  over three million volunteers  enterprises  businesses  okay  projects  mega projects on the street  all kinds of activity going around the globe  if anybody has to go nuts  it s me  okay  because all run by volunteers  run by volunteers means nobody is trained for the job and you can t fire them for inefficiency because they re volunteers   all right   and anytime  they come in anytime and do great things  anytime they ll walk away  all right  and nothing should collapse  till now  i must tell you this  as we are sitting here  this day  probably little over three hundred and odd programs  inner engineering programs are happening in the world  never in the last thirty three years  one program has been abandoned or has failed   that  that takes enormous management but nobody will ever see me getting angry or miserable or tensed out or stressed out   you ve never lost your temper   you want me to now    do i look like i m incapable of that  it s not that  it s not that i m incapable of anger  it's just that i have never given that privilege to anybody  i ve not given this privilege to anybody   they can make me happy  they can make me unhappy  they can make me angry  they can make me miserable  no  i kept  these privileges to myself  so people you re talking about miracles or whatever  people ask me   sadhguru  everybody  in very ashram  miracles are happening  you are beating all the miracles down  if we say something happened  you make us look like fools  no miracle  i say   what  you want me to pull a pigeon out of my pocket    if i pull a pigeon  but there are  no  if i    gurus  if i   who claim to do that  who have been challenged by rationalists  no  i ll come to this  if i pull a pigeon out of my pocket  i have a shitty pocket  and you have a bird  what are you going to do with this  you come to me  i will show you the miracle  i have thousands of people  who are working seven days a week  sixteen to eighteen days  eighteen hours every day  in the last two  five ten years  not a single moment of irritation  agitation  anger in their life  this is a miracle   this is a miracle we want to manifest  you don t want a miracle   i agree  this is a miracle   yes   and not that pigeon  do you have a pigeon in your pocket   okay    i told you i don t like a shitty pocket    i know   now  you were thirteen in arundhati s book  i read that you were thirteen when you first quite accidentally discovered yoga  you were children playing in at the bottom of a well  that s what the book says   tell us  how did you discover yoga   oh   i told that because that s how it happened to me  i said that to her  i don t know how she s written  i ve not read it   i said that to her because i want people to understand the nature of the universe is  even if you do  for the wrong reasons  you do the right thing  still it works  if you do the wrong thing even for the right reasons  it still doesn t work  people need to understand this because the whole world has invested on goodness  the goddamn goodness is killing the world  there re too many good people and these good people are the biggest problem  it s always a good indian who wants to fight a good pakistani  good hindu wants to fight a good muslim  good american wants to fight with just about anybody   the more good you are  the more fighting you are  the more good you think you are  because goodness is always in comparison  don t forget the good journalists who promote these fighting everyday on channels    i  i think  because your goodness comes by comparing yourself to somebody  if you were alone on this planet  you wouldn t know whether you re good or bad  what we need on this planet is sensible human beings  little more sense we could do with  isn t it  for sure  in every aspect of life  engineering essentially means you could have built this structure whichever way you want but you ll have to keep looking up  when it s going to crash on your head  engineering means you put it up in a sensible manner  the way it stays  without anxiety about it  similarly  inner engineering means you engineer yourself in such a way  you can go through the process of life without being anxious about your suffering  what will happen to me  there is no such thing because you engineered yourself well  whatever the hell happens around you  within yourself you are the same thing  so every time i launch one mega project  you ll say   sadhguru  if it doesn t work  if it doesn t work  what   if it doesn t work  what  if everything that i m doing  if nothing works  i will still die blissfully  this is guaranteed  i want to make sure it s guaranteed for every human being so that they can live their life without the fear of suffering  right now  instead of seeing how suffering should go  people are busy romanticizing suffering  the moment you romanticize suffering  it s very clear you are not interested in human well being  you like drama   hmm  you often spoke about how economic leaders are going to be the future of the world  you ve been interacting with ceos  it s rare to find a spiritual guru who s also quite openly capitalistic  are you a capitalist   what is that   who believes that wealth creation is for the greater good  of people and society   see  a whole lot of people are attached to poverty right now because without poor people  without hungry people they cannot survive  i am not one of those  i want to see that  six hundred million people on  in this country are postponing their dinner tonight  but we are postponing major decisions in the parliament every day  all right  i am not a part of that  i want things to happen because i know what it means to postpone a dinner  i don t want that to happen to pe  people  children are postponing their dinner tonight  probably a hundred million children in this country have postponed their dinner to tomorrow and that s not a joke  so  these jokers who identify themselves with this or that are going on playing their joke on the people  every day  so capitalism is an ancient word  it no more exists  we are talking about a market economy  when only a few families had access to capital  it was capitalism  it is no more capitalism  any  if you have a good idea and you know how to execute it  there is capital for everyone  all right  so  we have tried communism  it s a wonderful idea but that must happen willingly  if you enforce it  it s the ugliest thing  we have seen it we have seen a major demo on the planet  when a  most ugly things happened  you tried to enforce it  karl marx might have known lot about economy  you know  i was  i  when i was fifteen  i was all gung ho about engels  and karl marx and stuff  but he did not understand human nature  i realized that when i was sixteen  thirteen  fourteen  i was all fired up reading up all the communist literature from russia  but by the time i was sixteen  i realized these people don t understand what is human aspiration  without understanding what s human aspiration  you try to build a society  you try to build a nation  it s a disaster  okay  cruel disaster  but maybe it will work when really a country or a society is in total dumps  you have to force it out  when you have to force it out  it works but after that it won t work  in a way  if you come to the ashram nearly four thousand people are living in the ashram   well  you can say it s communist but by willingness  it s not by   okay  i did so much  so i get so much    no  everybody gets what they need  so this is not enforced  this is by choice  if by choice you re willing to share  how fantastic it is  but  i have nothing  you have something  i want you to share    how ugly it is   what is it with sadhguru and motorcycles    these days  i m on four wheels    but you haven t given up  your love for bikes or have you   it s just that when i was i started  you know  trekking in the jungles when i was ten  eleven  i would be gone  if i had ten rupees in my pocket  i would organize my food and i m gone with this little note in the house  i can imagine my parents  i  i always wished i shouldn t have a boy ever    girls can run away too on bikes   they run later   they don t run at ten  eleven   and they re on a pillion they re usually pillion and if they find a good rider  no problem   i m saying the thing was  it s not about the motorcycle or this or that  it is just that i was a cloud of million questions all the time and wherever i looked  nobody had a sensible answer  everybody has standard answers that they ve heard from somewhere  nobody has a genuine experiential answer  so there s a restlessness to explore just about anything  when i was ten  eleven years of age  i would be gone into the forest for three  four days  once food ran out and i couldn t survive  then i would come back  so  initially lot of excitement but later on they kind of settled down  they knew i ll get back  so when i became fourteen  fifteen  i cycled across south india  not because i was one cycling enthusiast  not like today  wearing a helmet and suited booted for cycling   no  simply i cycled because cycling is little faster than walking  the moment i became seventeen  i still didn t have a license but i found a motor to my cycle  which became a motorcycle   so that because it went little faster  it s  it supported my restlessness to know something i didn t even know what the hell it is  i didn t know what i was looking for but i had questions about anything i looked at  everything in the universe looked like a question mark to me   but the question about the motorcycle is really to ask whether the motorcycle  the land rover or land cruiser  which one is it now  land rover  land cruiser   i m not sure  but whatever  the four wheels  the helicopter  you i think you once said somewhere that i like that whether if it moves on land  water or air  i like it   this is not one thing is i like anything that works and machines work   the more efficiently  work  the better they are and why it s important is  after all  what is the quality of an individual human being  how smoothly and how efficiently your body  mind and everything functions is the quality of a human being  isn t it  so machines always excited me  whether it s a s  bicycle or motorcycle or because of you know lack of the necessary  probably the fitness that i was at that time  i crisscrossed india on a motorcycle  today it would be hard  so you get into something little more comfortable   but you know while that makes you a very interesting character to observe  did you ever worry that you d be labeled or dubbed a richie rich  person s guru  this is you know  this is the sadhguru who  see  the thing is   flies his own planes  no   who likes his bmw  who like his game of golf  who likes having a little frisbee match on the      l  let s  let s come to that  see  the thing is i would i wouldn t mind i even  sometimes we  i  i ride a bullock cart  nobody reports that though   i  i  i love to handle the bulls and i  i still drive that sometimes  but now you  i want to have a conversation with you  this afternoon till two o clock  i was in jodhpur  i could have come by bullock cart or a camel cart   you had to wait for five days   i came on time  you must appreciate that    so it s about efficiency is what you re saying   yes  so i l  i personally learnt to fly a helicopter where i don t have the time for these things but i somehow fit in this and learnt because seventy percent of our work is in rural india  tch  i thought this little helicopter could just i could set the place on fire because i m half the time stuck half my life  i m on the road stuck in some traffic driving myself  all the time  behind huge everywhere  there s no place in the country where there s no traffic jams  believe me  even in rural india  there re traffic jams  so i thought a helicopter would really revolutionize our work  i picked up the thing  i got my license  faa license but in india it s so difficult to get the license because many of these rules were made before wright brothers  came    well  according to some  the plane was also made before the wright brothers came   they say it was made in the vedic ages  they  they're not very wrong  conceptually  it was made  whether physically they built or not  we don t have proof for that  conceptually  there s no  conceptually  it s about imagination to think that you can move from place a to place b  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  you cannot conceptually imagine something entirely  even if you imagine  you must be able to produce some you must understand the principles in some way  as to why something flies  if you don t understand why something flies  it ll be like that you know once it happened  a little turtle  very  with great effort  climbed a tree  went to the edge of a branch and jumped  fell flat  lot of pain  slowly  again he crawled up  in another two days  again up  jumped  fell down  again up  fell down  after a few days  two birds who were sitting in the opposite tree  they were talking and they said   i think it s time we tell him he s adopted    all right   so i m saying what cannot fly  you cannot make it fly  people thought in detail  as to what can fly  what cannot fly  conceptually they thought  whether they built or not  we don t know  and is it  is it  i mean  it is an established fact  they calculated the speed of light  somebody  some individual cannot calculate the speed of light just like that if there was no whole scientific culture around him  no individual will just drop from heaven and calculate the speed of light  okay  there must have been a scientific culture  otherwise it won t happen  but we need to understand there is a difference between science and technology   but there s also a difference between science and mythology  some things are just great stories that doesn t mean they actually happened   see for example  there are  there are images or there are sketches which show  which probably somewhere between three to four thousand years ago were made  where it clearly shows a turtle and a round planet sitting on it and going around  turtle is the best example  best analogy for a planetary movement because a turtle cannot accelerate   same speed  he just keeps going  so a round planet on a turtle is the best way to describe how a planet moves around  and the very word for geography in this country is bhoogol  which means it s a round planet  so it is not because of galileo we know it s a round planet  we ve always known  how do we know  we can t know just one scientific fact and not know the other aspects related to it  so this thing about anything indian  beating it down  is because one thing is that culture has evolved because half the people  their brains are in greenwich mean time  they ve still not gotten out of the 1948  whatever happened  we struggled for independence  we came out  not just to send them out but to be who we are  so  that problem is still there and now there are upstarts who claim all kinds of things  there has to be an even balance  not beating down this or pumping it up in a  unrealistic way  but you cannot deny indian mind has thought about things that nobody had thought about in those times  there is no question about that  but there is a distinction between science and technology  science can evolve because of certain intelligence  technology needs material manifestation  now we are trying to claim technology  which we should not  if we just focus on science  many things will be attributed to india for sure   we live in times when faith and spirituality have become very inflammable  don t put them in the same basket   okay  let s talk about faith first   mhmm    we live in times when faith for certain has become a very inflammable  easily politicized conversation  if faith should have been personal today  it s not  today you actually have decisions taken in the name of somebody s faith being injured  so you mentioned food right now  i read somewhere that you said there s nothing religious about the act of food  just eat what you like   no  no  no  i didn t say that   eat what s good for you   i said eat what s good for you   okay  eat what s good for you   it s a very different thing    i correct myself    eat what s good for you  but today we have a highly politicized conversation around banning beef in the name of faith  how  it s definitely not good for you to eat it   beef or any meat   i ll come to that  finish it  finish the question   okay  okay  so i m offering that as one example of how i see a politicized conversation taking place around faith  how do you reconcile the faith of a large number of people with questions of individual liberty  i know i have read that you like books written by salman rushdie  we were the first country to ban him again in the name of faith  how do we reconcile faith with individual liberty   see  it s always been said  faith moves mountains  yes  but it freezes your mind  but the greatest crime you can do on this planet is to move a mountain  you should not move a mountain  it should be where it is  it has not just dropped from somewhere  it s grown because of various forces functioning in a particular way  phenomenal activity has happened to build a mountain  you should never move a mountain but  people with frozen minds always want to move a mountain  okay  having said that  when we say faith  it s an import for this culture  we have never had faith in this culture  you must look back little beyond thousand years since we ve been under occupation  here  we have been told always   your life is your karma  karma means action  whose action  your action  so what we are saying is your life is entirely your making  there is no someone sitting up there and managing this for you  this is entirely yours but for every action that you perform whether physical  mental  emotional  energy wis whatever kind of action you perform  there is bound to be a consequence  if you re ready for the consequence  do whatever  if you re going to cry about the consequence  control the action right now  based on this  now you came to food  see the food consumption has been looked at very carefully in this country  if you just bring this back  the world will be healthy  do you understand  here  we have identified different type of people  what they should eat  if you re doing menial jobs  how you should eat  if you re doing trading  how you should eat  if you re into spiritual process  how you should eat  if you re into education  how you should eat  why this is is each person needs a different type of building of the body  you want to run hundred meters next to mr  bolt  what kind of food you should eat  you just want to work in delhi  what kind of food you should eat  you want to think in a certain way  what kind of food you d  you should eat  for all these  we have very clear prescriptions  now when it comes to food  what it means is  we are taking another life  whatever that is it may be plant life  animal life  whatever you re taking another life  ingesting it and you have to make it your life   that s the whole thing  what is your life  what is that life  if you look at it  all life on this planet is coming from the earth  this body is also the same soil  this is also same soil  if there is a earthworm  that is also same soil but see how it has become  how this has become  how that has become  if i give you  you like a mango or a banana   mango   mango  i know   you re ru you re ruling the state right now  referring to the aam aadmi party now  if you eat a mango  this mango becomes a woman in you  if i eat a mango  the same mango becomes a man in me  if a cow eats a mango  the same mango becomes a cow in the cow  why is this happening  there is a certain information or software in you whatever you eat it transforms it into a woman  if i eat  it transforms into a man  if a cow eats  that becomes a cow  so every life is happening the way it is happening because of a certain dimension of information or in modern terminology  let s call it software  there is a certain software  which is an arrangement of information  now  the idea is to eat as simple a software as possible  if you eat that kind of life  which is a very simple software  your ability to override that software and make it entirely a part of you is very good  as that software gets   complex  more and more complex  your ability to integrate it goes down  so  especially if it s a creature which has some sense of thought and emotion  if it has emotion  then you should not eat it  this is the understanding  an animal  which has any emotion  displays certain emotions especially if it displays emotion which is near to human emotion  you should not eat it because it will not integrate itself  that animal nature will start manifesting itself  or in other words  in india  today maybe in cities people do not know  you see in the villages  people have very intimate relationship with a cow  they have drunk the milk of that cow  their children are drinking the milk of that cow  there is a very deep relationship  if you do not know this  cow is one creature  if something happens to you and you are in some kind of grief or misery  you don t have to be near the cow  wherever the cow is in your house  it will   it ll start shedding tears for you  you know  i ve seen this with my eyes  i couldn t believe   when somebody is dead in the house it  what does a cow know  it is somewhere  simply tears flowing  so when it s  has such deep emotions  if you kill it  it s like killing a human being  it s murder or it s cannibalism  so because of that   this is not a faith thing  this is not a religious thing  we thought this is a fundamental sense  why  when we are hungry  why can t i cut you up and eat you  what s wrong   what s wrong  i m asking   but what you re saying should be about many more animals than just the cow   yes  yes of course   and when it becomes about only the cow  then there is a  there is certainly a perception  i  it is not   that it is a political decision or a religious decision   no  no  i am not talking about the  whatever the laws that are happ  this is not about people getting up and saying   it s cruel to be  to be a meat eater  that would be a different argument   hmm  i am not even talking about cruelty  even cutting a plant is cruel  in my experience but you have to do it  but if you are conscious of it  you will do it to the minimum possible extent  not do it wantonly  that s the whole thing  now  about this political ban about cow slaughter or whatever  this has many things  one thing is there is a sensitivity  once you drink milk from the cow  she is like your mother  killing your mother and eating her up is something people cannot digest in this country  still eighty percent of the people belong to that category and they re  they re hugely there s a huge emotion  such a emotion  which because they ve always been made to be docile in a certain way  they have not violently  reacted to it but in some places it has happened  in villages and other places  there is already a beef ban in many villages just by norm  not by any law  that you don t bring these kind of  things into the village  i am not saying you must ban it or not ban it  i am saying the sensitivities of your population  you without considering  you can t go do this blatantly  because it is growing  it s becoming a growing business  india is becoming a major exporter of beef  that s not right  even if somebody ate something  it is up to them  it s their personal taste  whatever but now you re promoting it and you re making it grow  there is serious concern but our people don t express it  our people don t go out on the street and not going to kill anybody because they killed a cow  so ban is not what is needed  more education was needed rather than banning   but you haven t spoken to what happens when faith faith repeatedly seems to come into conflict with individual liberty by the banning of books  there were people killed in paris because they were seen to have mocked  you know of the prophet mohammed and so on   see  so where does this end  where do we stop violence and politics in the name of religion   if you  if you want that to stop  you must understand this  you re saying   today  today  it s not today  in the last 2 000 years  this is the history of the world  continuously it s happening all over the world   so is that bombers are a new phenomenon   well  you ve forgotten about the crusades and the other things  which have not been reported in history   hundreds of millions of people have been killed in the name of god  all right  it s new to us here  but even here  thousands  hundreds and thousands have been slaughtered in northern part of india just because the faith that they belonged to when the invasions happened  nobody writes about it because we never took the pen and wrote  somebody wrote history for us the way they like it  because all history is sponsored by kings  they wrote the history the way they want and they said they are great emperors but what they did was absolutely terrible  so you need to understand  faith is a new thing to us  when i say new  in this country which has 12 15 000 years of history behind us  1 000 years is new for us  we ve still not come to terms with it  we re still struggling with it  but struggling within ourselves  not creating a struggle on the street because that s not our nature because here always we ve  been drilled into us  whatever you do there ll be a consequence for you  even if you come back another life  another life  it won t leave you  it ll come back to you  tch  this has been told this controls people  this is a this is a tremendous technology  please understand this  and it s not simply a fake thing  it is a real thing  everything that you think  feel  act  there is a consequence  not because there is somebody thinking he must give  gift give you a reward or a punishment  it happens in your own chemistry   how do we keep faith  which you say is new to us  separate from politics  you have  you have  in the past for example  i remember when anna hazare was lodging his anti corruption movement  you did come and applaud it but you said that the lokpal was not some magic wand  i remember you saying that  do you believe that we are seeing a dangerous cocktail of faith and politics getting more and more mixed up   see  it is happening  i m not saying no but it s much less than ever before   really   yes   it seems to be much more than ever before   no  that s because of you   that s because that s because if  if ten people get beheaded in some remote part of iraq  you make sure the blood spills into my sitting room  because of that  otherwise  you re sitting here now  today  let s say 1 000 years ago  we were sitting here  1 000 people got killed in iraq  we will sit here peacefully thinking world is going really great   spring time   everything is nice  so  this is because the dissemination of information  if ten people get killed somewhere  it s a huge thing because it comes into our sitting rooms  bedrooms  dining room  everywhere there is a television  so it pours into our homes  so it is happening  so  this is good because even a small thing looks magnified now in people s experience but this has been happening always  it s happening at its lowest level now  here and there it spurts up  which needs to be controlled for sure  but what i see is  for the first time  for the very first time in the history of humanity  even if you the numbers are not qualified because the population has increased  even in terms of percentages of people  how many people can think for themselves today is huge compared to what it was a hundred years ago or five hundred years ago or 1 000 years ago or 10 000 years ago  all these centuries  there would be one man in the village who thinks for you  who reads for you  who writes for you  you just have to do what you have to do  simple things  today  everybody is able to think for himself or herself  now  human intellect is blossoming  i do not say it is blossoming in the right direction  with the right sense  no  insanely it is blossoming  it doesn t matter  insanity will happen for some time  people will come to their senses  when something is new they ll go crazy  after some time they ll come to senses  once human intellect blossoms sufficiently on the planet  then this looking upward for well being will not make sense  believe me  right now  from looking upward  slowly the world is tilting for in pursuit of human well being  people were looking heavenward  still many are  that s different  but a whole lot of people have started looking outward  so if you look heavenward  hallucinations will happen  wars will happen because my heaven and your heaven different  you know  none of the heavens have anything for women  you better know that    i am definitely going to hell   anyway  so you believe in heaven and hell    i was being facetious  i was being facetious   let me finish this   i was being facetious  i don t know if there is somebody up there   that s fine  that is fine  i  is it a force  is it energy  is that inside me   no  i m saying this this thing about looking heavenward is slowly going away and in pursuit of well being  people are looking outward  this is ripping the planet apart  human pursuit of well being is just destroying the planet  now  the fundamentals of what we are transmitting the fundamentals of this culture  which is essentially rooted in the yogic culture  what you call as indian culture or hindu culture is essentially a pure yogic science  in the form of culture  it finds many colors and distortions  which is what you re seeing as the hindu culture or indian culture  whatever you want to call it   but they re not interchangeable terms   why   because we re  a multi religious country with many different cultures    we have  i want you to  i want you to understand the word hindu does not signify a religion  you ask them do they worship one god if they are hindus  in the same family  they re worshipping twenty five gods   they don t they don t know which is the god  so they re making sure worship everything   just in case something will hit  okay   now  the word hindu means the land between himalayas and indusagara  this land  this subcontinent is hindu  all people who are born here are considered hindu because it s a geographical identity  i know there s a whole political issue  if i speak like this  they say   oh  he s hindu   no  i mean people will tell you you re echoing the rss  chief    i don t know what he said  i have not  he said all indians are hindus and there was a huge  okay  i am not   political outcry over that   okay  all indians live between himalayas and indian ocean    that s okay   those who want to jump into the ocean  that s okay    if you live   see  this is a dialectical culture  it expresses things in a certain way  between himalayas and indian ocean if you live  you are a hindu  if you jump into the ocean and cross  you are a lanka  okay   so  i don t know what is the struggle about this  this is because there is such a narrow understanding of this  this is the debate which we have to change in the country because somebody has absolute belief systems  we are trying to compare that to a culture where there is no such thing as belief  we have not ever been believers  we ve always been seekers  this is a land where the highest value has never been god  always liberation  mukti freedom is the highest goal  god has never been the highest goal   so you  you put this in the same box as something  which just believes this is it or you re dead   unfortunate  that s not the way to look at it  this is what we have to bring back  if we really value human freedom  you must bring back this seeking for liberation   i want to be free  not just from others but from myself and my god and my heaven and everything  because god has never been the goal in this culture  god is just another tool  when i use the word tool for a god  people get very hurt  they say   sadhguru  don t say that  it hurts us  i say   that s okay  you come to the ashram  i ll give you some plumbing job   all right  see  that ll hurt more    no  no  no   no spanner  no winch  nothing  use your fingers  nails  teeth  whatever  three days later  nails will be gone  half the teeth will be gone  then i will give you a spanner  will you worship the spanner or no    we are who we are as  as human beings  we are who we are only because of our ability to use a tool  otherwise you are not even good as a dog  you can t even fight a dog  isn t it   so you re against organized religion  quite clearly  if god is just a tool and faith is not the same as spirituality   no  i  see  no  no  i m not  i m not saying i m against this or that  all i m saying is i want human beings to come to this much if you know something you know it  if you don t know something you don t know it  everything that you do not know you believe   this is a dangerous thing  now  the fight on the planet is not between good and evil  this and that  no   one man s versus another man s belief  i m saying why the hell do you believe anything  because you re essentially not straight enough to admit   i really don t know   i don t know  people can t fight  i don t know  you don t know   can we fight   i know  is a fight   i do not know  is never a fight   i do not know  is a way of seeking  if we do not establish this seeking in every human being  that every human being is longing to know whether outside or inside  whatever  you are because this is the nature of human intelligence  it can t sit quiet  it can only sit quiet if you freeze it with belief system  if you seal it with belief system  it can sit quiet  otherwise the very nature of this intelligence is it wants to know   okay  we re almost at the end so i think i m going take a few questions  just two three minutes of questions  i m seeing lots of hands go up  the lady behind you  yes please   namaskaram  sadhguru  in one of your videos  you say that the problem with the world is that most people lack the intensity       most people lack the necessary intensity   mhmm   and then you say the way is dhyana  so intensity is more associated to fierceness in personality and dhyana is more associated to calmness  so they re somehow counterintuitive  can you elaborate a little   people think peace means rest in peace  because their idea of peace is death  peace can be very intense  peace can be tremendously intense because peace means the reverberations of life have become subtle and intense  action means reverberations of life are not so subtle  it is at a certain level  so peace happens not because peace may happen if somebody is dead but to be alive and peaceful means you need to be highly intense state of energy  otherwise you can t be peaceful  the reason why most people who don t have any problems as such  you know after all they re trying to earn a living  reproduce and bring up their children and die one day  just for that they re freaking simply because of lack of intensity  because life is happening at a low ebb  naturally everything is a problem  if it rises a little bit  suddenly you have a little clearer view of everything  for this  you need a higher intensity of energy within you and the yogic system is essentially focused towards that  dhyana does not mean    no    okay  let s take the next question  here  right here in the front row  yeah   sadhguru  what i get from isha s philosophy  if i may say there is  is that you need to see internally  in your interiority  you need to fix it internally before fixing your external situations  but is it also not right is it also not very important to do the right thing externally  you know  just to make myself more clear you know  if i be more precise  no  no  i m clear  i get the question   why  do i look so dumb    let s say you know  if somebody  i got it   yeah   i got it   if somebody is born  i got the question    isha s philosophy is not about looking internally or externally  it is just that if you re looking for mangoes  you look up the tree  you don t dig the earth  all right   but if you re looking how to plant a mango tree  then you dig the earth  you re looking for mangoes if you dig the earth  will you find it  i m asking  so if you  inner things  you must look inward  outer things you must look outward  there is no such philosophy    look out or look in  wherever the damn thing is  look there    like you know  shankaran pillai went for a job interview  and they asked him   which is further  mumbai or moon  he thought profoundly and then said   mumbai  they said   how do you say this  he said   i can see the moon  i can t see mumbai     okay  last question  yeah   namaskaram sadhguru  i just want to ask  hold the mike closer to you   yeah  i just want to ask you that everybody s perception of good and bad is different and what do you think if we start manifesting our own good and bad  what ll be the state of the society   hmm  maybe you won t have power tonight   i think i already made this clear  the biggest problem with the world is there re too many good people  not enough sensible people  sense is life specific  okay  goodness need not be life oriented  goodness may be going to heaven  and the moment   i want you to understand this dangerous concept  people don t address this   the moment you believe suppose i believe there is heaven and it s a beautiful place and you can live in the company of gods  should i send you there today or no  if i really care for you  i m saying   yes  if i really care for you and if i believe there s a great place  should i send you there or not  this is a dangerous thing  do you understand  if you stretch it to its logical end  it s a really dangerous thing  the moment i believe there is a fantastic place up there  i really love you and i want you to go there  you know   tch  yes    okay  let me just end by asking you something that we haven t spoken about and then i ll hand it over to chiki  you said you love machines   i didn t say i love them    okay  you like machines   i  or they re useful   they work   have our lives been overtaken by gadgets   not mine   no   definitely not  i use all the gadgets but they don t overtake me  these are fantastic things in our life  things  see  in every way  compared to how a human being was  let s say hundred years ago  you re almost superhuman  tch  hundred years ago  if i could just pick up something from my pocket and talk to somebody in america right now  i would be superhuman  why superhuman  if i said  i m god  people would have believed me  hundred years ago  five hundred years ago  if i just had a light bulb  i would have become god on this planet  i want you to know  look at the things we have today  we are really superhuman  once this kind of capability has come to us  little more sense has to rise  little more awareness and consciousness stu has to arise  if this doesn t happen  this capability will turn against us  this is what you re saying  now gadgets are freaking people  why  it s a simple thing  you  if you want to use it  you can use it or you can keep it aside  because you are in a compulsive state  if you start using a cell phone  you can t stop it  even in your sleep you re texting  see the boy is  he s in a  he s not with me  he s in  looking at me in the screen   now  this is the same thing  if food is good  if you start eating you don t know when to stop  if you start drinking  you don t know when to stop  if you start doing something  you don t know when to stop  the same thing  it is not about the gadget  it is not about the food  it is just that there is not enough consciousness  there is compulsiveness  everything is happening compulsively  instead of addressing the root  you re trying to kill the gadget  gadget is a fantastic thing  every damn gadget has enhanced our life in a huge way  isn t it  don t curse the gadgets  it is just that compulsiveness has to go   well  on that note  i will say thank you for provoking us  as always  a pleasure  to have you  a pleasure    let s have a big round of applause for sadhguru here
