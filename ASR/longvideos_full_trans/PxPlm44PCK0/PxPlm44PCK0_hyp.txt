sanblyand good  but for your devotees you are so i said  and get to a  again when it seems to be in qualigionwi so many other questions that come up as a magic of individual liberty i can this will me for a very interesting and important conversation for a  so i would like to thank you for being thought of this conversation and in my state when the spiritual and i hope what you say to be is also addressed to the skeptics i count myself among a skeptic who if told that another human being possesses some sort of godly part a of perhaps as the first instinct not believe it  but what i find interesting about what you some  your saying the scothtooutofhetissopewanament  is it youre actually saying that what  xperencetheonoffitsens anything that peenxperiencebeyondtheficecensoscanbepolgod can be gonfolewrd or can we cold you re so so i got doesn'tnecsissarilyexist why do we in good  why do any sun  you drive the i  do i drive  and  i have  so i  so if you drive in an unknown telling so

i know  a afonsatinthagodenhorbhangoe'svoiceongemans and also  if it again  and that i can  i am  idyoman'svoiseeftooa a  beginning of this conversation perhaps unthelins that you want  you are a ntificul of what we imagine who lose to  we expect people with ontcrac we expect people who don t have a zest for life some of alefisfititraitysvictionalybeensaterdarounggime around a tones of  i upstiningfromlesuresfrom then i tinctourcomfirts why do you believe that the mativia can co exist with the fortune  it's not that i believe it's only because you have a body which is your physicality  you have a life  if you did not have a body if for disembody  and that we do  because buttdisebotydbengyourdonhaveonevationtoi i don t be a bit of doltobo people are in a no that is the sea  because they re not in caring domes of the living  that to the ted the  i go you can nengtedidsly whatever you want the living wisviatwhantheywanateico but it is poblimentoniteson so ive say what i want to

that in just a moment is a elaetoallderfoser censefyinetstratwithinourselsuc   then does that mean at a is and the agnostic and the skeptic genialswirissviriualip is inner enternering only for to

wromgclassirgisn it is and then i took it they won a  because they won't have certain thing  not to believe something that they do not know  but are notsensiuinot o know it is a begousprobem the biggest problem in the world  people are still not strahteenough to come to a place what i know i know what i do not know  because they do not realize the immensity of idea  do not know is the basis of longing to know and seeking to know and the possibility of knowing  the moment you destroy i do not know  destroyed on possibilities of knowing  so this is a is a and this is this then that different then in the same  epretentobedefented one believes as  another believes negatively but the book believe something that they do  one lurerpersenawelonpersonindthecuntry who was about living is an idea  and when they comes  somebody tisinteducesmefistime i am of  this is the no i believe there is no god  i said i don't even believe that youmeanjbmitatthe and i  i laedthateiwhativ a  and the  thats the thing is you so  something you dont seem to understand that the most impohtinthings to come to this place of being actirtlystraght and sincere with life what i know i know what i do not know i do not  if you come to this man if you glowslypayattention to everything a on you you will see with all the sinoficexploration we do not know even a single atom in ten  that s a fact so what is it that you know said god  why i millions of people yodevrtenscousdyoujustsaiythat  in you  it is a bit is on  then my dowitisotothis  an ant of the a  in the line  as well in  so what if  but the is something they think that you know because you just said that life is actually about a mittingwhatouvoteuh only to that is there are things that you do know  no no i sifingantheyhaveitgotceintoamhytetedtat this moment in bed that we know what be on the sungrodoukno and what youre not  i do you like a equiseebewonigistr what do i know  i don't know anything except this one  i know this piece of life from its origin to toliment everything that i need to know about this life i know  and i see every other life is  same thing you should look dip enough in that context because to the modern signs is coming to this that  a tearlymecuseurwallwing which is a is a construction of thirty what they are beginning to say is whether it s an emeberoragrassopwerarer  i met a bird or an animal or nelethindodoyouorme or the whole cosmos the fundamental design is same it is only a question of complexity cencesophistigation of the same design so this is something always leoicscines has been saying that if you and now you know andeonofmenonee you know if you know the tomicyounolequesoni because the fundamental design is  it s only a question of complexity and sophistication of what s happening  so findofmentlyfwhonotthispeceoflife  everything by influence  said this piece of fly of doing your self you mean this moment or do in when this piece of life or a bee of lyponture are you life or  are you media a deer  no no because people a medium  i  i i i would hope i m not lissenlikees  and sumyknowsbeterflis let you gathered it is a  yet what you will is my lesson  us lowlygaderedortabitoftye if this much aconilitionoflisionblood tdismutampusions have to be gathered there must be something more fundamental  do you think of yourself as a guy a mistake or a good  i m not with ted time thinking about myself fortolyourdratemituningo i don't think us  the  i m a did this whole thing because of the type of very i do of education that s being deadivreto  we re thought would have an unfortunately thought is a simple thing i don't ississer against everything that you believe in because you don't to believe  to be  a  i ve  in me it was qwestonthat  the  a  but as a my  me that it is possible to man  using  is full of person  now now the thing is what you call it  is coming from the limited deter that you have gathered from the experience of your life every person is the same thing how much it would be have gathered  still too small compared to the size of discothmo tundtewathandpannomenoflikeisapplningy from this limited did they tell  and recycle things and genertytot or in other words nothing new ever happens eeingpurtimedicians and iriansan the same thing we you gone whatever  their sense of what we re teaching in the name of in a nginelingneth to engineer yourself in such a way every moadofyourdligisanyewpossibility  it has to become a new possibility what is needed is perception when i say perception people think opinions i am talking about perception you see here similarly enhancing your perception so that you perceive life right now when we say thought  and we re talking about expressing life  expression is not so for one in a way begannexxpress but perceiving it is  and because this phenomena to fantastic it's not a small thing the gooddishenomenothat'shappeningheedhislife itself  so if you want to know this phenomena the only way you can know the only doorway for the open on life is yourself see let notthekinosieme is a  no  and point of what i  are you  mystic from south  now this light is falling upon me reflecting  your lenses in what i imenionthettetyeknow  herdyusiem  i i the same  no   you see me the way unpredicted in the firmament of your  you cannot see me here in the very nature of

you you can think oh he s no good this is the fundamental problem that we think his perception is no  no no his perception is very good for his survival your perception is very good for your survival but it s not good enough to know the nature of life but but  now what do i know means i have not met  my perception the way it is important  to know the nature of life not just for survival but if in inner engineering as the spoauateacnolegiis something that walk  so again  miniangoolsicousthat and is of it in  is biaingsomunetovanw ulanabcthe  i think so do you remember when you fortiasahe that
