going everyone  good evening everyone nobody saying anything  and they re on a over the very falanteralwaiyingfortadoto  and let me did you i have to  as i came on before hes a  quintelexstatoher under the statemahattileaticredyfau so a why a goodargyouwithpa and i was saying to myself i must be like this is the  with my good i must be relaxed that this is it so yes i will come here begin by thanking you said guru  for giving me this optocenticeeto be in conversation with  you shall foundation thank you very much  to when were talking about oflovenlife heart beating is a good thing  a uteiiheesiisagood it to them alive and in love and a about to begin this skunethasion and a a buriyoenota i attended in an engineering  i am seen them  are bus and everywhere there are your brilliant views on a various issues it could be from the making of a nation to the making of a dog  from the handing of a household and to the running of filaments you have brilliant views on every issue that lunanafprqureston yet i know what ylooklabartyu and it you know he s a brilliant mind with an for a a rate  that say out of the box thinking so  and sort of freshing enlightening i am fascinated and i want to know about your life and i like to know that  i mean were you just born brilliant is a begin from that very moment  i was enomend  in come in a box  my mother had a normal to  now if i you know  on the movie that i can had thinking was it likgaesinstorywal of anerablestagegimedyurhome and when he looked at your mother you said  that is going to be on a geo rejice you will lighten his own bar as a atyovyuosaregoinglikethis  now it was it like that or how  how is yard child  i don't think they all came to listen to my mother s labor pains  with now im reading fasinatedin that we are a  but you know the way you think we we to heal much you have to say we moreentychilren wolonoutbut we ve not have been been educated in schools and but i find our we have think now of being they condition like almost system in time here is so we widedanallbegin i think you re looking for something unnatural that happened there  thinking that could be considered a natural was  it seems i was the ready delaework my mother went to the husband three times and came back and she gave  to he's not coming  and a when it at all we happened it happened at all my father being a physician that was not possible  had to be the hospital the i i went and tatimsartdint happen they did have it in possible and she gave up so it happened at home to the  only reanablyunnatuilthing everything  a natural word i then  box i i i i sure educated  upon but it and the question that you askkingas do people grow up and blotton all of the brother by somebody you  see the gender epesioni  brought up in this place have a  in ductway especially in the west i will see  out of christian  dish very common words i think it s absilutelythdipolusandhumiliating that a human being has to be brought up you bring up cattle okay you don t bring up a human being a human being is supposed to blossom by his own isha that is why he s on the top of the pile at least on this planet in their reducionaescale and most human beings don t seem to understand that  or they are not allowed to understand that by a whole lot of people and they need to be brought up bringing up means somebody is molding you molding mens its a pleaedtimin shape  and no flavor that blossoms is the same way as a  the one which blosamdestivy but a more means is always going to be the same  no  the idea of making a mold is that we want to have the same form again and again and again right now genderly that seems to be the work unfortunately after calentdeucationsistem the so all religions that are operating in the world and of course the family they want you to be in a certain more they do on you to bloom like a wild flower  rate of anything fresh happening among them  and something that tdisfamilia they don't want something and familiar to be brown among them so if you have ciccomdtothatsystem then yes you be more into saidnpom if you allow your humanity to blood and see you don't belong to any more  is the beauty of being human that there is no a particular way to be if you were a dog you would be one way  they would be on  if you re a sefouwouldbinodoaf  i would be another war grasp the rest opperrandotheway but to be human means it is not particular way what is human is not defined not described it is it is just that for every other creature on this planet nattedrouttulis within that they have to play that again at a himanveing only the bottom line is drawn  or a line but socially people are trying to draw a top line for themselves but nature has not drawn a top line for you elimitliss possibility  this is what is freaking human beings right now because they can decide what they can can to be they re trying to be like somebody else on your rortonlineisseid  this is evolution  but a wienawestididn'tmi  how was it when you were a child you re you would into a school to go the systematic way and then i a  i look at it a educated  some below  acelyounowhen i go in stand in the line megritionlansonparticularlyinamagratheylook matacanisbeakungish  as i have that uneducated look it s not easy do you know do you know what it takes to remain uneducated education is just twenty yelsoppoyingsomewhadandgivting one satoficet  an uneducated it's really difficult because from the digoadbone ouorparinsaverytherutherthassholthebanding blymody'sttimetoeducatetouo about some that s

million questions hanging in in my head i have a question about everything everything ever  questions means very frontdamentl quistions about acxistence tell my own existence so an imastafl so it suddenly i realized i know nothing no nothing man  somebody gives me a glass of water i do not know what is what i know how to use it i know  ingetittoehenchmithirstondso many other it of us  but i do not know what is  i m saying even today you do not know what he is what so only thing arelabelinanestates on the planet to put her to the planet  it to of your body is water if we think life within water but do you know what it is with all the scientific exploration we do not even know a single atom in its ntiveity to the our idea of sciences learning how to use everything yes  a usanaten have a break it  or a fuse it but we really do not know what it is any one thing tiniest in in the creation  we do not know in its antitity this  fact of life well even something simple as what you started with  looking at water  traigtowaustok at age to  and what it can do and it you can  ichegulesanditbecomesthatyoucan ken and i quenctesitho tusaenleverlookedeadidandsaid  don't know what is what because nobody looks at anything see everybody is looking like this nobody has any attention for a piece of life here theyre like this if you pay attention to one life one late  one is  one human being something else will happen the five i said life and  at the copareatentuoneto one human being somelowewerlhappestytinnu  if you miss life atly some emotion in the betertinlessapponde that will happen only if you pay attention to one if you re looking at like this  to become a fashion because you re in love on facebook you low the whole humanity a tulaanwoman if you want to love one human being it costs life to late hollymanipy doesn't cost anything even better the law had he is always easy to love somebody was not i that  its so easy but if you have to love somebody whos sitting next to right now it costs  you know how difficult it is to love someone was next do rig now how easy just to love someone who is dead a with in heaven hesintee  face it because if you have a low why one thing is you have to pay attention without attention it will not happen and if the all you have to give up something that is you to a commidiceanoter and he he not have  henglishsexplecsioninstwa  you must fall in la you cannot rise in love you cannot stand in  we cannot fly in  you have to fall something of you should fall and i i not work you will not night so you want to have a fake sense of life then you don t pay attention to any everything is in formation nothing is a living experience everything is from the pixtpookorfrondhesinemartlanghornhep nothing is a less experience the doing more or more today have that so gradooujistmentionedla and today it is about life and love i would like to know  for us it is maybe love your family  is what have i could be i i i i ask you this is be as this somanyvat of this and i dearly want to get to it  some teachers so  some guy to say you know  i love but you must be detacst oh you  no but it cannot be conditional it should be unconvistionerand so this versions of it i just want to know  a  the shamyoulassenpewiofmakeyou keep coming back to me  to give you something that you cannot do  to give you a teaching which you can never do  you must law but you must be detached you have to keep coming back to me for consultation  lets   saying throw yourself into your love fananddienly something will happen something we what happen if you willintodieinthe process not just anything  to work or your life or your love or whatever  you should do not know how to throw your entire self into it you will never know the taste of what it is low but be detached what do you want to love then  only because you want to include somebody as a part of your life part of yourself that s why you love no i love but i m detached this means you are to come back to consultation every it s like a sakcapussjob every day you have regomentedonthecouch you need segment and then it a few so  what a lie  it so you can love and be attached one idonsithat  a okay of coming back to contintecontheve so what do you think  i i only say so what is this need for love in a human being he is understand a human being constantly constantly  a humoning is longing to be something on then what they are great now  if this finds a simple basic physical express me on the sexuality sesulelicyminsstust physically you re trying to make something which is not you a part of yourself but a pelmomentimensucceed you should try this mentally it gets labeled as  conquest maybe simply shopping shopping shopping  i  some people go for conquest with swords and guns  peopilogovetecbalecancapsoupcretitcarts the thing is you want to include something which is not a part of you as yourself that is a whole effort whether you want money or well a you want to alcoubyannit what is it something that is not you you want to make it yours  yours is an effort to make it a part of yourself if it happens emotionally on the emotional level so  we call this a love far you re trying to make somebody who is not a part of you  or south emotionally  the law fat if you do it consciously we can this yoga to a man union so all this efforts had fine  thing has its own beauty but has its own limitations when you understand the limitations of all the other  nothing of it a wrong about it it is just that it will work briefly he will not work for always when you realize that you consciously try to include when you consciously become an inclusive process if you  if  experience everything as yourself then we say you are a yogi okay so this is a low affair successful so something you said at the end which  i would like to ask you again  and la inclusiveness i can t understand how i can love everybody  you cannot the suntictluconatl i can be seen up there  so how is that had you incued everybody in your  as our looking at now as something that comes to are you yet to the process of  only because you appreciate a particular quality a shape of somebody s nose out of the shape of that  on the part of the emotion of the males  the milittal things had the valrelitty something okay the maniminitins it is based on something that is acceptable to you  if they do something that is not acceptable to you alocrumbles yes  now what an sing  i wanted to look at this we allow happens to you or hate happens to you and it happens to you misery happens to you joy happens to you i twenty happens to be dinielisent yes it never people say love is in the air no because you are feeling very pleasant in your  so only arfyswybr always been you missed all your life now you re beginning of feeling a  so whatever human expeen laorhant whatever whatever happens only within you what i am saying is at least what happens within you must happen by your choice consciously you must be able to make it happen if you re ive  if you had experience of what is happening with the new is happening by choice what is a problem it only happens to a tiny  love is not a relationship a olissionship is a different thing love is a certain sweetness of your emotion we whoocitthetreeadadoghor a man had a woman or a child or just at the sky why are you look at a loving because it s not about loving the sky its about the sweetness of your emotion  emotions are sweet whatever you look at you look at it in a certainly right now you have nasty emotions to whatever you look at  you look at it in a different way  you have always associated loud with somebody no no this is not about some  love is not something that you do it is something that you can become  in you can be  you can make it a motion in your many sweet space you give you make  if you make your body very pleasant it becomes pleasure if you sit here it can be great later just sitting here and breathing if your mind becomes pleasant we say this is joy if you re a motion to become pleasant we say this is love if a very life hanetytobecompleasant we said this is blissfulness this is ecstasy if you set anding t become pleasant we call that success now you calling your success with somebody as love that a mystic you have a sucsesitoitywith somebody that is  created pleasantness in that mospirbepeenyou and lets if i ten people around you you re calling that law no that is actually success we could that net lots of management is i had i sudeno yes it does yes but for you to be loving that is not management i should just make her temotonseet you are not enstersreetandits beautiful wilelieis it's not about anybody if somebody comes we can share it if nobody comes you can sit with the is clolsandstilbelo at the one it is not about somebody it s not an action it is not something that you do it is something that you can become  it is its a lovely idea  it is not a deficussanymade i mean you d really have to practice this because  and singing  wexactlyamse i i do an act an action comes to perfection with practice only if it s an action  saying love is not an act is health an a  acting helyrigtnow  i know you re an actor but are you acting and a  he  so i held this because we have done seven  and helties isn't it oh we have not done it  or a ive even now  a  or even given  it may or not be one we had   then set on things to manage our help similarly if you go sit in things  can manage the pleasantness of your mind if you do it on other things you can manage this blasintnessofyourtamoh if you go sit and other things you can manage the plishintness if you ready life and i  this is things that you can do now what you can do internally you trynkafmaneditinen can be done here with the new you are trying to manage by creating an itmuscuretabou  which is a very difficult thing to do because outside will never happen hundred percent the way you want it to some extent we can manage we can go olifitbouces  as the many forces in love or said something but health and you said you do certain things for self that the you re given it and then how you maintain it is you eat well exercise and utivanaity now to be loving when maybe house any situation maybe outside like you said outside forces are not pleasant it doesn't come easily to then just be love so what is the practice to become that way  to change yourself to be that  i i want to remove this idea from your mind you believe you need to  this practice means you tried to perfect perfect an action is to be low  a time yes is that is not an act no not an act no  i i i go and i go  so  it is like apiniccause  not a otdecceptin like now do you want to keep your mind the part process pleasant or nasty what is your choice i do let it he distanclesanttoenest the thinking of  this is a 'mtrynetotinesute to and the nitikneaupparhapa so  okay nasty  i'lottleblessourlnotiknowara i get  my life is the i  oh  i anahimenlenxtoestofthemselveshisdefinitelypleasant  but in mind emotion everything and so at  you want it pleasant yes so why is it not pleasant surroundings are not pleasant because of many things  and  if you taught an emotion or not pleasant  hardly you sent  yes surroundings not an badly mean so many forces we had the manage them  then  wieshohisubsesflwith everything a ares  and a different people have different levels of conpretatonmanishedoutside a olifhishave the same ah what is  the skill to manage the outside but inside your emotion and your why is it not happening your way this is something we have to look at this has to be addressed  man being has to address this at least you are to part and you re image must happen the way wanted slightest on a certain day a lady went to sleep a lady went to sleep her sleep she had a dream i think up there a erhertostatofpeople nobody thersliveeright so that i could pick on armdesopingofhagonsp sewandorsleep up there and in her dream she had  am in her dream she saw a hunk of a man standing in that corner and then he started coming closer and closer and  he came so close she could even feel his breath she trembled not in fear and then she asked what were you go to me the man said well lives you a dream  how is it  what's happening in your mind is your lodydlin now the problem with life is not that life is not happening the way you want even your dream is not happening the way you want  the same  i m saying at least fix to this at least let the im happen the way you want if you were dreaming the way you want right  you have thought on your emotion would be pleasant isnt  he s botherthen when to in the world is another thing that said to rent  that means a lot of skill this is a willingness why re continuously talking about joy thislnas low he is not because it to go  evtieseamontholdsbayitsefh only way when you are pleasant by your own nature you stop being in pursuit of happiness you are not fine by yourself you don't have to go anywhere to feel less you don t have to do anything to feel later sitting here you re feeling very pleasant now you will look at life the way it  other where you

emotions that we go through it  like all these totyonweklyfirsels  what is going on  that a human possibilities and keepebelites every possibility becomes a problem for those who do not to explore the possibility in its like perspective that is a temmendous possibility an ant cannot think like you  he can work better than you  moisciplinlyb a better terfecruls than  not typeocdanotthere okay but he cannot think like you  that it is a  this is a  lit but now this possibility has become a problem for ninety percent of the himminuty now they re freaking because they can think and the thinking all the wrong they ought to become nasty i the  pleasant the woldhaebeenjoiedthepococis because it s become nasty it s becoming a ailment isnt  people are suffering that not immensely  they do not know how to keep it  nothing has been done towards it so what is a possibility always becomes  trouble if you do not explore it in the right per  i so you have thought and emotion has become a problem now love affair is a  you re making all kinds of things out of it better all coming on this misunderstanding not understanding this thought animolstieisenetetedby me i coneneated which of our way i want

aretingbecomessomanythings every creature has sexual drives the gonfulveliitiverme we can do it consciously so we become something something we are doing the same things but we re doing it can  sleep saddonlythereisamagic about  not because sex is magic for dismagicana because we can do it conscious every basic act like eating and copulating mecomssumatic because we can do it consciously if you leave that one thing if you exclude that one thing from a life that you re not conscious about  you think the  of the  at the way you a warning if you re not hunch us about it everything can turn  everything can become nasty so it is this which sets you apart from every other creature so a dog is walking on the sea if i sort of misgetitinwaged  if you do the go  if this is what you are  that if somebody is nice so you waggolrwhatever if somebody is not nice to you i like them i m saying what were the  and you forget about civilization im doing whatever you  it is the vilution  sign of a illusion i ask or let s go to  i have seen people cropping answers in examination on a as a sense that  a today many women in our modern society are stepping out and having a cure and i just like to know what do you think of this of women stepping out being career people managing home as well being financially independent is is good the every woman should do what she wants to do as an individual person  should not be made into a trend in a society or the only a thing to do in the world  because i think if if a woman intends to have to to an and raise them i think it s a full time to  and not take you should not go out and work she is to a aninduidentpersonshesreatotowhathewontstodo but having two children is not about reproduction he your maneffecteving the next generation of people how

umdennandenandragesxpatyaplisisom is so this is the this is what they re watching this is what they think is  this is the this is a have been happening stuff  and in it the is so we came the thenundenamasalar i know it was still a i was in the middle somewhere the  a wonderful lilertwastillovely but today it is whonnybutnomaveandainthings a branmovedetwintumthen oh i am forgetting at this moment with the lutexabetthat it's it's its shallow right now a india  youngest population in the woods ridnow with such a young nation growing up on this this is the feed  what you see this what he i'mdesiiltly concerned as to what they were turn out to be sure your parents were consent to  the u s okay so can i i m sure my parts of very concerned renisannaa so every bit and has this concern evident genaition has this  and that the next innorities going wrong always i understand what you re saying  this sadenchangdifeverydeleicenlihestoo one step beyond where the liviousteniionessteftinonaveo everything just for the sake of doing something different or it s natural they ve gone up in one at much  to take you down on that len  even yes a next is not only next that s what you say next is not always next that yes it s not higher so i  it is or  its  so this concenteeonhisthendbut now the thing that is happening is not the next it is a serious influence because in the last fifteen years the words have believed to communicate across colcis and borders i saw heavy and so unprecedented nobody has ever been used to this kind of inflencesitifareocan  for this level of hinvlienttanomryoungpeople never before possible  nothedenedition as ever experienced this can of an slope from so many directions no emufrinflencisstoobig so we in terms of changes have happening in  it is not next it is simply somewhere and nobody knows  is because it s too complex and too mixed no body no here is inloringtheyoungpeople  just and make of things so this is because of a sudden an lot of information and communication we did not fullushojudgewethat it's good or we it is that definitely this level of information when i say information  it's like when we were growing up i believe it was still for your denetionanse we never knew what is more on how  this there was no such thing wobujust excited about everything that came our way but you ll see to the tele  to the bolemart a a  i see the head as i go because then on the whole costmusteveitsthe see it on the fhornsclenotoannecompudes  on the ones we they ve seen antiecorsmo they not everything things that you do not know then on you  and then on the  a  each  by the time they re eighteen they re had five laoffers and gone in the western world like that here also it s beginning to happen  by the time the eighteen have seen everything that you need to see it  mind emotion okay by the time they twenty fire what what next when i go  you will see this is not my wish but this is something that i see the way people s mind their work  the way they bin laden with information i m not a by any stantersoffitimistec person but i m us seeing this  if this level of information continues and ittlemunteplyndmanifol or the coming denevations you should not be sure in the next fifty to hundred years if fifty percent of the human population choose to come in to his  you should not be surprised because that is what will happen to the mind somebody s clapping look at this is popular  naehemtisthet  thats nine saying  lteysanethingtothe this  a more people kimnetsswihide in this world than all the wars and murders and accidents manage to kill  so more people are on self havdoerding than murderers war mongers bad drivers everything could together moepepelerdonselfhelp and if this level of information on that continues on human mind i know the nature of mind absolutely because i know my  i know how it works what they can and what it cannot  i know it clearly what human mind  that's the reason why i don't have to a we open  artlystintothetantiting  they say one sentence i know what the mind is because i know destructive of human mind in time otherwise i would be him so i see  if this level of information on so continues at the same phase or at higher phase  is possible in the next few years  this was definitely lead to wanting to ternminat yourself  because there would be nothing to live for  there is no joy and excitement about anything you will please watch your children by the time that twelve fifteen days is bad you lookbacaryinownlife those of you who re or fifty as of age just look back at in or in on a life then you re twelve fifteen was there any room for you to get bored about anything sidncplywerexcitedabouteverylittlething isn't   to do and see it's all must have come in feature to lefiftienyelonkinsertestbolkonipin  yes there all and i bad the founder  we re toinhobotlowanlive  i will not mean nothing because you had one love fare and you

whyonfecesmoklehavpwendytolloffastgoingsimontiniously you just means nothing  i m not saying they should have it or not have it  a sing is this ll lead to a certain old role on the mind and suddenly a

fisquestonisrumropassintherasssindtheresain where and how do we draw the line between loving unconditionally and becoming a doormat i enetanastandthis  being right now as a lanes generlyahthetcillenefatki you give me this i ll get you that if you don t give me that i don t give you this this is not said but it s done in it  it's done i sent it not sit  so human beings have physical psychological emotional economic social and videos other kinds of needs to fulfill this things when you say i love you  in s of making these things ugly needs that  teintensactions that we have to do you give me thisuvimithat to bring suneistetacand ty to tistansfection be corted with a cedenamountof sweetness of her  which we quolar'sleveaffact when the fensecsens happened more only

physical needs  oalesethecanomicgneatswehaveadangement where we can conduct this in a more taticmanner i am not saying it s a i do wrong this is the fact of life so this level of love i call this this is enough for to fulfill the domestic needs of once you know for two people to live together to for their means to  children to raise them domestic level of love or fairpiplecan  but if people want to have a lower far which will bring them to an othtematuonin then not many people are competent to do that  not the toes not many people are ready to have that kind of a lower far when i make two lives into one two becomes actually one in experience that we need something more most pepelaocompretentof using low to futithedomesticneats but to go we on that they are not ready i anesididnotbehertheo but this person of that person so when one is ready and another  it at one is making an effort and one tebesonthave the effort then it feels like somebody is becoming a door land that is what it is that it feels like that being exploited but a or a one whos longing to become use now as a way of ultimate union should not be bothered about being dogma this an  in india we have a con  then by

affair if you re looking for conducting of domestic of a then you must manage dignity who gets what anybody is using more than what they should then if you don t give me that i don t give you this okay in the way you should looking for a tometouin  should not think of all these things that s a different affair that s not for not much social thing if you fall in love itself you become welnorableto   without becoming wornotablethetisnot  you have to follow  when you fall somebody may res you or somebody miwalcoeio yes  but the thing is the  experience of your life is beautiful because you fell not because a as you not because of a going  because you could actually have the sense of abandon in you to fall that was the beauty of your law of far not what they gave you what do i do with this now the beauty was you sat alone and you think you have really loved this plesinso  to ilingtodie that  the most godeful moment the moment they gave you a big gift  the woman to give you a damondoing  the woman they said tisenthataboutyoukno you just sat here and you re willing to die that was the moment not just a dog  you re willing to be the dust on their feet okay i am not saying you should be like that i am saying where love transformed itselentodevon if you fall in love itself you become really woolnorable but there is sillsamsritsoffanity in lowerfass that you can recover  but if you to become a deity there is no sanity left and you cannot reap so before you to set a land or you may see what the youfferlitor not what are your bolsfistofall if you re gone is to make a life a cautioned a very measured love fat is good but or you re leryourthinkis you want to dissolve into the process of  you dont want to have a good life you re not planning to have a good  you just want to be an explosion of life you don t care what you get in what you do  then you become a debate devotion means it should intention to dissolve into objectodevosh  so devi is not expecting whether i had become a good magalocrounonsomebatyshad what i will i become as long as i can tortyoufeoheador whatever it's fine with me i saw the a different state of existence i don't think somebody was looking for a domestic level of loweffachshouldevenasktetqut  we have one question from the social media the face book  i am muthernantstoknow in this matenalistic age the real feeling of love is disappearing from a knife most of the love we receive from others and express to others is superficial how can we reinforce the real feeling of love in our own life and in others forget about others if you i should learn to be loving by a ornatre not because of somebody else or something else i know the question is coming from facebook narmusphosbility  you can even allow those people who dont do an exists so msangitsoftemande's possibility so if you  just become laugh not love somebody then you will know the nature of  if you love somebody it s a fill happening because no human being will happen hundred percent the way you wonder  very human being on this planet is on a disaplintedbeliely not because they ll do something wrong because nobody can fulsiltheundlean i unrealistic expectation you have  that is simply not possible have you been able to fulfill anybody s expectation i m asking you and do  but partially but never thenttirtlyisnty  nobody else will be able to do it

close light on this sigiciansago so you need to understand the institution of marriage one thing is as we said a little idea it s about bringing a certain sanctity to the simple basic needs that every human being has i will repeat that a physical  that a psychological means that econoticneed and motionall social but i i mean  to fulfill all these things we set up an institution calmaniegwit  it can be conducted in a sensible manner and of ice if we did it on the streets like every other creature i do dornatlifor us feel not good about it so to bring some sense of organization some histhitic some stability because man and woman coming together naturally brought fresh life the nature of human life the nature of human offspring is such that because of the portibilitiessthattahumanlyincavise it is compereto any other creature it is the most helpless life i need to make him on the mantessiport you could leave a puppy on the seat as long as he gets food he grows a in a good dog no problem but not so it tisheman being  as a need just physical support he needs vaiteaofsupportanstebabauallasaa situation whether they should be made in society or not one will debate when the eighteen because

tnatiedhemdthemadus  you have not come up with a better olunatid because a stable situation is a must for a time once you have a child i to cendyyou project  that is if they do all the no ealytolivnonrodect  so if you want to get into such a  at least two endeas there must be a commitment to create a stable said at  you are womsonfancieswith see in your emmosenswithtenes if that is what it is don t get into such situations it's not compaity fat everybody to get married sgoodyuneyoussingpeoptularethinkingwhithhettogetmaidotham it is not a necessity for everybody but if you get

bride  how we an walk away isentet they have their benefits and they have the problems it's your choice but at least she s consciously to get married because everybody is getting married you don't have to talk about madigentewasinsamebreath as if they come together this is a completely  american idea you think in the maddegenbewestogethe nobody thought of the was in this anretill ently isn't it
