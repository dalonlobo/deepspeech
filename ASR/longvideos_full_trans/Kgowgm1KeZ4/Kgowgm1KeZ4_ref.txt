 good evening everyone   good evening everyone   nobody is saying anything     no they are all here but they are very silent  they are all waiting for it all to begin and let me tell you  i have to confess  as i came on   before this i was quite relaxed   but as i ve come on to the stage  my heart is beating really fast  so   while guruji was praying  i was saying to myself   i must be relaxed  this is the time  when i am with my guru  i must be relaxed that this is it  so  yes i will calmly begin by thanking you sadhguruji  for giving me this opportunity to be in conversation with you  isha foundation  thank you very much   i  i thought when we are talking about  of love and life  heart beating is a good thing     okay  yes it s a good thing  it shows i m alive and in love and about to begin this conversation  and sadhguruji  i want to say  i have attended your inner engineering program  i have seen some dvds  i have read your books  and everywhere there are your brilliant views on various issues  it could be from the making of a nation to the making of a toy car  from the running of a household to the running of parliament  you have brilliant views on every issue that one can ever question  yet i know very little about you and it you know here s a brilliant mind with an  for lack of better words  i would say  out of the box  thinking   so different  so refreshing  so enlightening  i am fascinated and i want to know about your life  and i d like to know that i mean  were you just born brilliant  did it begin from that very moment   i was a normal birth  i didn t come in a box   my mother had a normal child   no  you know  i m from the movies and i can t help thinking   was it like it is in story books  that a venerable sage came to your home and when he looked at your mother  he said    there is going to be born a guru  rejoice  he will lighten his own path and that of others   you also  you also going like this    no  but was it like that or how was it  how was your childhood   i don t think they all came to listen to my mother s labor pains    no  i m really fascinated  intrigued that we re all here but you know  the way you think  we wait to hear what you have to say  we ve all been little children and we ve all grown up but we ve grown up and been educated in schools and but i find our way of thinking  our way of being very conditioned  like almost systematized  whereas  so where  where did it all begin   i think you re looking for something unnatural that happened there   one thing that could be considered unnatural was it seems i was a very delayed birth  my mother went to the hospital three times and came back and she gave up that he s not coming   and when it actually happened  it happened at home  my father being a physician  that was not possible  she  she had to be in the hospital  three times she went and three times it didn t happen  they did everything possible and she gave up  so it happened at home  so  that s the only reasonably unnatural thing  everything else was natural   birth  i didn t come in a box   and i refused to be educated   so  what is i mean the question that you re asking is  do people grow up and blossom or are they brought up by somebody  you will see the general expression is   i was brought up in this place  i was brought up in that way  especially in the west  you will see   i was brought up christian   i was brought up jewish  these are very common words  i think it s absolutely ridiculous and humiliating that a human being has to be brought up  you bring up cattle  okay  you don t bring up a human being  a human being is supposed to blossom by his own nature  that is why he s on the top of the pile  at least on this planet  in the evolutionary scale  and most human beings don t seem to understand that or they are not allowed to understand that by a whole lot of people and they need to be brought up  bringing up means somebody is molding you  molding means it s a predetermined shape  and no flower that blossoms is the same way as another one  which blossomed yesterday  but a mold means it s always going to be the same  if you make a mold  the idea of making a mold is that we want to have the same form  again and again and again  right now  generally that seems to be the work unfortunately of the current education system  the so called religions that are operating in the world and of course the family  they want you to be in a certain mold  they don t want you to blossom like a wild flower because they re afraid of anything fresh happening among them  they want something that is familiar  they don t want something unfamiliar to be born among them  so  if you have succumbed to that system  then yes  you ve been molded into a certain form  if you allow your humanity to blossom  then you will see  you don t belong to any mold  this is the beauty of being human that there is no a particular way to be  if you were a dog you would be one way  if you were cattle you would be one way  if you were a sheep you would be another way  if you re bird   another way  a grasshopper   another way  but to be human means there is no particular way  what is human is not defined  nor described  it is  it is just that for every other creature on this planet  nature drew two lines  within that they have to play their game  for a human being  only the bottom line is drawn  there is no top line  but socially  people are trying to draw a top line for themselves  but nature has not drawn a top line for you  it s a limitless possibility and this is what is freaking human beings right now  because they can t decide what they can   need to be  they re trying to be like somebody else  only bottom line is set  top line has been removed this is evolution   but wait  we still didn t quite get to so how was it when you were a child  were you  were you put into a school to go the systematic way and did you keep up with it  do i  do i look that edu  educated  don t insult me like that   actually you know  when i go and stand in the line in the immigration lines  in particularly in america  they look at me and say   can you speak english  i say   because i have that uneducated look  it s not easy   do you know do you know what it takes to remain uneducated  education is just twenty years of going somewhere and getting one certificate  to remain uneducated  it s very difficult because from the day you re born  your parents  every other adult  the school  the damn thing everybody is trying to educate you  yes    about something that s not worked in their life    and then did you also  like we all went through these confused teenage years of not really knowing where we re going  i mean did you clearly know your path   not at all  i was  right from three or four years of age  i was always a million questions hanging in  in my head  i have a question about everything   everything to everything  questions means  very fundamental questions about existence itself  my own existence  so  when i was three  four years of age  suddenly i realized i know nothing  know nothing means   somebody gives me a glass of water  i do not know what is water  i know how to use it  i know if i drink it  it will quench my thirst and so many other ways of using it but i do not know what is water  i m saying even today  you do not know what is water  it s the only thing available in all three states on the planet  three  two thirds of the planet is water  two thirds of your body is water  if we think life  we think water  but do you know what it is  with all the scientific exploration  we do not even know a single atom in its entirety  today  our idea of science is  learning how to use everything  yes  we know how to use an atom  we know how to break it  we know how to fuse it but we really do not know what it is  any one thing  tiniest thing in the creation  we do not know in its entirety  this is the fact of life   well even something simple as what you started with  saying that looking at water  i mean  straight away i was taught water   h2o and what it can do and it you can mix it with colors and it becomes that  you can drink it and it quenches your thirst  but i never looked at it and said you know   i don t really know what is water   because nobody looks at anything  see  everybody is looking like this  nobody has any attention for a piece of life here  they re like this   if you pay attention to one life  one blade of grass  one grasshopper  one human being  something else will happen  that s why we said  life and love  because if you pay attention to one human being  some love will happen within you  okay  if you miss life  at least some emotion in that direction must happen to you  that will happen only if you pay attention to one  if you re looking at like this  these days it s become a fashion because you re in love on facebook  you love the whole humanity  to love one human being if you want to love one human being  it costs life  to love the whole humanity  it doesn t cost anything  it s even better to love god because it s always easy to love somebody who is not here now   it s so easy  but if you have to love somebody who is sitting next to you right now  it costs life  you know how difficult it is to love someone who is next to you right now  how easy it is to love someone who is dead or who is in heaven  isn t it so  let s face it  because if you have to love one  one thing is you have to pay attention  without attention  it will not happen  and above all  you have to give up something that is you  to accommodate another  otherwise it will not happen  the english expression  it s very good    you must fall in love  you cannot rise in love  you cannot stand in love  you cannot fly in love  you have to fall  something of you should fall  otherwise it will not work  you will not know it  so  you want to have a fake sense of life  then you don t pay attention to anything  everything is information  nothing is a living experience  everything is from the textbook or from the cinema or from the internet  nothing is from life s experience  you re doing more and more today of that   sadhguruji  you just mentioned love and today it is about  life and love  and i would like to know  for us it is maybe love your family members  whoever it could be  i  i why i ask you this is because there re so many versions of this and i really want to get to it  some teachers  some gurus  some guides will say you know   you can love but you must be detached   ohoho    you must love but it cannot be conditional  it should be unconditional and so  there s versions of it  i just want to know  so have you   see  the simple  the simple way of make you keep coming back to me is to give you something that you cannot do  to give you a teaching which you can never do  you must love  but you must be detached   now you have to keep coming back to me for consultation   endlessly    sorry   i m saying throw yourself into your love affair and die into it  something will happen  something worthwhile will happen if you re willing to die into the process  not just anything   whether it s your work or your life or your love or whatever  if you do not know how to throw your entire self into it  you will never know the taste of what it is   love  but be detached  what  why do you want to love then   only because you want to include somebody as a part of your life part of yourself  that s why you love   no  i love but i  i m detached  this means you have to come back to consultation  every day  it is like a psychiatrist s job everyday you have to come and sit on the couch  you need treatment and there is a fee    so  okay all right  so you can love and be attached  no  no  i didn t say that   okay  i m coming back for consultation  please   so  what did you say   i only said  see what is this need for love in a human being  you must understand  a human being constantly  constantly  a human being is longing to be something more than what they are right now  if this finds a simple basic physical expression  we call this sexuality  sexuality means just this physically you re trying to make something which is not you  a part of yourself  for a few moments you may succeed  if you try this mentally  it gets labeled as greed  conquest or maybe simply shopping shopping  shopping   oh   some people go for conquest with swords and guns  some people go with cheque books and cash  you know credit cards  the thing is you want to include something which is not a part of you as yourself that is the whole effort  tch  whether you want money or wealth or you want to occupy a nation  what is it  something that is not you  you want to make it yours  yours is an effort to make it a part of yourself  if it happens emotionally  on the emotional level if you try this  we call this a love affair  you re trying to make somebody who is not a part of you  a part of yourself emotionally this is a love affair  if you do it consciously  we call this yoga  yoga means union  so  all these efforts are fine  everything has its own beauty but has its own limitations  when you understand the limitations of all the other methods  nothing right or wrong about it  it is just that it will work briefly  it will not work for always  when you realize that  you consciously try to include  when you consciously become an inclusive process  if you sit here  if you experience everything as yourself then we say you are a yogi  okay  so  this is a love affair  successful   so something you said at the end which i would like to ask you again you said love  inclusiveness i can t understand how i can love everybody in this room   you cannot  there are some people you cannot love    i can barely see  up there and up there  so  how is tha  how do you include everybody in your love   see because you re looking at love as something that comes to you or you yield to the process of love  only because you appreciate a particular quality a shape of somebody s nose or the shape of their mind or their thought or their emotion or the way they speak or the way they do things or the way they relate to you  something  okay  there re many many things  it is based on something that is acceptable to you  if they do something that is not acceptable to you  love crumbles    yes   now what i m saying is  i want you to look at this   whether love happens to you or hate happens to you  anger happens to you  misery happens to you  joy happens to you it only happens within you  isn t it   yes   it never  people say love is in the air  no  because you are feeling very pleasant in your emotions  suddenly air feels vibrant  it always been  you missed it all your life  now you re beginning to feel it    okay  okay   all right  so  whatever human experience   love or hate  whatever  whatever   happens only within you  what i am saying is at least what happens within you must happen by your choice  consciously you must be able to make it happen  if you re able to  if your experience or what is happening within you is happening by choice  what is the problem  it only happens within you  love is not a relationship  a relationship is a different thing  love is a certain sweetness of your emotion  whether you look at a tree or a dog or a man or a woman or a child or just at the sky  why can t you look at it lovingly  because it s not about loving the sky  it s about the sweetness of your emotion  if your emotions are sweet  whatever you look at  you will look at it in a certain way  right now you have nasty emotions  whatever you look at  you look at it in a different way  so  you have always associated love with somebody  no  no  no  this is not about somebody love is not something that you do  it is something that you can become  if you re willing  you can become love  you can make your emotion into a very sweet space  if you make your mind if you make your body very pleasant  it becomes pleasure  if you sit here  it can be great pleasure just sitting here and breathing  if your mind becomes pleasant  we say this is joy  if your emotions become pleasant  we say this is love  if your very life energies become pleasant  we say this is blissfulness  this is ecstasy  if your surroundings become pleasant  we call that success  now you re calling your success with somebody as love  that s a mistake  you have a success story with somebody   that is  you have created pleasantness in the atmosphere between you and let s say five ten people around you  you re calling that love  no that is actually success because that needs lots of management   yes  it does   yes or no   yes it does   yes  but for you to be loving  there is no management  if you just make your emotions sweet  your emotions are sweet and it s beautiful be  be like this  it s not about anybody  if somebody comes  we can share it  if nobody comes  you can sit here with eyes closed and still be loving  what s the problem  it is not about somebody  it s not an action  it is not something that you do  it is something that you can become    it s a  it s a lovely  idyllic  it is not idyllic  it is  it is the way it is   it is  i mean you d really have to practice this   why   because i m thinking  see  this is what exactly i m saying if it is an action  an action comes to perfection with practice  only if it s an action  i m saying love is not an act  is health an act  are you acting healthy right now   no   i know you re an actor  but are you acting healthy    no   so health is  because  yes    you have done certain things and health is  isn t it   oh  we ve not done certain things  oh  we have definite   we ve been given  no  no  no  no  oh  we ve been given  but if you eat bad  if you live bad  you won t be healthy   hmm   we ve done certain things to manage our health  similarly  if you do certain things  you can manage the pleasantness of your mind  if you do certain other things  you can manage the pleasantness of your emotion  if you do certain other things  you can manage the pleasantness of your very life energies  this is things that you can do  now  what you can do internally  you re trying to manage externally  what can be done here within you  you are trying to manage by creating an atmosphere around you which is a very difficult thing to do  because outside will never happen hundred percent the way you want it  to some extent we can manage  we can t do all of it by ourselves because there are many forces involved   sadhguruji  you said something about health  and you said  you do certain things for yourself  certain things  one   you re given health and then how you maintain it is you eat well  you exercise and you remain healthy  now  to be loving when maybe in a household  any situation  maybe outside  like you said  outside forces are not pleasant it doesn t come easily to then just be loving  so  what is the practice to become that way or to train yourself to be that way   i  i want to remove this idea from your mind  you believe you need to practice  practice means you re trying to perfet perfect an action  isn t it   to be loving at all times  yes  yes that s not an act   no  not an act  but to be so accepting  no  i don t want to i don t want to go back to the movies  okay    no  to be so accepting because  no  it s not about accepting  right now  do you want to keep your mind your thought process pleasant or nasty  tell me  what is your choice   ideally pleasant   just tell me  pleasant or nasty  you re thinking about it  this is  no  i am trying to think should i fox you and say nasty     say it    okay  nasty   i m going to bless you now    no  no  no  okay i take back my words   okay  all right  so  any human being s choice for themselves is definitely pleasantness  isn't it   yes   body  mind  emotion  everything and surroundings you want it pleasant   yes   so why is it not pleasant  surroundings are not pleasant because of many things  yes   if your thought and emotion are not pleasant  it s entirely you  isn t it   yes   surroundings   not entirely me  it s so many forces  we have to manage them  we have to juggle them  not always are we successful with everything around us  you know different people have different levels of competence to manage the outside  not all of us have the same  what to say  the skill to manage the outside  but inside  your emotion and your thought  why is it not happening your way  this is something we have to look at  this has to be addressed  every human being has to address this  at least your thought and your emotion must happen the way you want it  on a certain day  a lady went to sleep  a lady went to sleep  in her sleep   she had a dream  i think up there    oh there are two strata of people  nobody is asleep right   so that i could pick on you  i m just looking if i can see  she went to sleep  up there  and in her dream  she had a dream  in her dream she saw a hunk of a man standing in that corner  and then he started coming closer and closer and closer  he came so close she could even feel his breath  she trembled  not in fear and then she asked   what will you do to me  the man said   well lady  it s your dream    okay   i m saying what s happening in your mind is your bloody dream  now the problem with life is   not that life is not happening the way you want it  even your dream is not happening the way you want it  that s the problem   i m saying at least fix this  at least let the dream happen the way you want it  if you were dreaming the way you want right now  your thought and your emotion would be pleasant  isn t it   yes  but it  well  fixing the world is another thing  that s a different game  that needs lot of skill  this needs just willingness  why we re continuously talking about joy  blissfulness  love  is not because it s a goal by itself  these are not goals by itself only by  when you are pleasant by your own nature  you stop being in pursuit of happiness  you are fine by yourself  you don t have to go anywhere to feel pleasant  you don t have to do anything to feel pleasant  sitting here you re feeling very pleasant  now you will look at life the way it is  otherwise  you re an endless race  pursuit of your happiness is a lifelong thing  till your deathbed you re pursuing  what does it mean  if you re pursuing happiness when you are five  i can understand  but that was not the fact  when you re five you were simply happy by your own nature  when you re fifty  you re pursuing your happiness this is a failed story  isn t it   but  sadhguruji  suppose we say this to the common man  who has a little house  where did you meet a common man    i m imagining it   every man or woman think they re special  believe me  oh yes   yes  so where did you meet a common man  i m asking    okay  sadhguruji when you said about the common person and the special person  i know some teachers have always told us and why your own parents always tell you that you know   you are special  each one of us is unique and i remember this part  i am not sure whether i heard it at your discourse or on a dvd of yours  where you said  it was about you know people being special and us always thinking that god knows of us  and you said something like   do you know all the grasshoppers in your garden  so  of course all of us have said   no  so  you said something like   so  how does god know each one of you then  and i was devastated because i always thought somebody up there knows me  cares about me and i m special   you thought  you thought you re number you thought you were number one on his books  is it   well  i ve been told since i was kid   you re special  you re unique and god cares about you   let me tell  tch  tch  tch  see  if when somebody says you re unique  it s an insult   you know  no  you said   no top line  so you re  okay    peaking in different ways   in this vast cosmos  this solar system is just a speck  tomorrow morning if the whole solar system disappears  vanishes  evaporates  nobody will even notice it  maybe it s not even in the accounts books of creation  it s so small  in this speck of a solar system  planet earth is a super speck  in that  mumbai is a micro super speck  in that  you are a big man or a woman   this is a huge problem  this is a very immense existential problem  you know   this is because we have lost perspective as to who we are  what we are  our psychological realities have become bigger than the cosmo  than the cosmic reality  that is the big problem  it s time you step out of your cinema i m  i m not talking about the hindi cinema  i m talking about the cinema that everybody is playing in their own minds  see  see right now they darkened this whole hall because it works best that way  this is the basic technology of a cinema  if you do not darken the cinema hall  if you light it up and play a nice cinema  it s not going to work  you have to darken it  so  i m saying  a cinema of your mind because it s a dark space  every thought is enlarged  playing out bigger than the cosmic space  today  everything in the cosmos is happening perfectly well  but you have one nasty thought crawling in your head and it feels like a bad day  isn t it   yes  yes   so  that s because your psychological realities  your petty creation has become larger than the creator s creation  you lost perspective of life  that is the fundamental basis of all this confusion and suffering  if you see who you are  the micro speck that you are  you wouldn t imagine that god is made in your own image and he looks like you and whatever  okay  if  if we were all buffalos  we would definitely think god is a big buffalo    okay  okay  so what is it really  please tell us the  please define it for us  what is it  what is going on   this life  this love  all these emotions that we go through in our lives  all these thoughts that we create for ourselves  what is going on   see  these are all human possibilities and capabilities  every possibility becomes a problem for those who do not explore the possibility in its right perspective  thought is a tremendous possibility  an ant cannot think like you  he can work better than you  he s more disciplined  he betters main  better traffic rules than you  there s no traffic jam out there   okay but he cannot think like you   yes   that sets up apart  this is a possibility  but now  this possibility has become a problem for ninety percent of the humanity  now they re freaking because they can think and they re thinking all the wrong things  their thoughts have become nasty  if they were pleasant they would have enjoyed their thought process  because it s become nasty  it s becoming a ailment  isn t it  people are suffering their thoughts immensely  because they do not know how to keep it pleasant  nothing has been done towards it  so  what is a possibility always becomes a problem if you do not explore it in the right perspective  so your thought and emotion has become a problem  now love affair is a problem  you re making all kinds of things out of it  which are all coming from this misunderstanding  not understanding this thought and emotion is generated by me  i can generate it whichever way i want  if nastiness is what you like  you do it  i don t care if that s what you like but you re suffering it  if you re suffering it  you shouldn t be doing it  i am not telling you   be loving  what is your choice   pleasantness or unpleasantness  if unpleasantness is your choice  you enjoy it and do it  what s my problem  you want to drink poison  what is my problem  i am just telling you this is poison  this is this   drink whatever you want  but by choice  don t drink unconsciously  that s stupid  that s not befitting of a human being  a human being means we are far more conscious than every other creature on this planet   that s what sets us apart  every creature eats but we can eat consciously  so our eating becomes so many things  every creature has sexual drives  they go and fulfill it whichever way  we can do it consciously  so  we become something  something  we re doing the same things but we re doing it consciously  suddenly there is a magic about it  not because sex is magic  food is magic  no  because we can do it consciously  every basic act like eating and copulating becomes magical because we can do it consciously  if you leave that one thing  if you exclude that one thing from your life that you are not conscious about the way you think  the way you feel  the way you act  the way you move your body   if you re not conscious about it  everything can turn ugly  everything can become nasty  so it is this which sets you apart from every other creature  so  a dog is walking on the street  if you show it a biscuit it will wag its tail  if you do this   grrr it will do  if this is what you are that if somebody is nice to you  you will wag your whatever  if somebody is not nice to you  you will bite them  i m saying what where is evolution in you  forget about civilization  i m  talking about evolution  where s the evolution  where s the sign of evolution i m asking    okay  sadhguruji let s go to  hmm  i ve seen people copying answers in examination but never questions  yeah questions   well  today  many women in our modern society are stepping out and having a career and i just like to know  what do you think of this of women stepping out  being career people  managing home as well  being financially independent  is this good   see every woman should do what she wants to do as an individual person  it should not be made into a trend in a society or the only right thing to do in the world because i think if  if a woman is intends to have two children and raise them  i think it s a full time job  i m not saying she should not go out and work  if she wishes to  as an individual person  she s free to do what she wants to do  but having two children is not about reproduction  you re manufacturing the next generation of people  how the world will be tomorrow  will be determined by what kind of mothers you have today  believe me  you know  i ve seen many ladies coming to me and say  when i ask  what re you doing   oh i m just a housewife  i said   why do you say  you re just a housewife  you  you don t seem to understand the significance of  you know  being able to nurture two or three new lives  it s not  it s not a  not important  job  it s a very important job  career   i want you to understand right now because we have made the whole world into economics unfortunately women also getting as stupid as men  as if how much money you earn is going to determine the value of your life  no  it is just procurement of things that you need  money is just about that  man was procuring  woman was taking about the more beautiful aspects of life  now woman also wants to procure  if there is such an economic need in the family  fine she must do it  but it is not a compulsive need  it must not be set up as something better to do than doing something  if she sings so  if she  if she plays music or if she just loves her children or if she cooks beautifully or she just lives beautifully like a flower  it s good enough  i m saying  it is not necessary that only if she earns this much money  she s  her  she s doing something valuable  otherwise she s not  if there s an economic need  she can do it  or if she has a passion for doing it  she can do it  but  let not such values be set up in the world because you re not evolving  you re regressing  you re making survival more important than aesthetics of life    okay sadhguruji  let me take you away from this and let me take you to a world of say films where i come from  world of films  okay  let s go  let s go movies    years ago when films started and you know through the sixties  seventies there were lovely stories  nice values  beautiful music  lyrics  by the time i was the star in movies some of our jhatka matka s might have shocked the previous generations and they must have said what is all this  but it was still within limits  whose limits    i mean what s acceptable to society  whatever have been  i ll say  and then now today the complexion of films  the kind of films we see  you know it s little clothed  it s live in relationships or you know up there on screen for everybody to see and night club culture  i mean it sometimes worries me that my children are growing up now this is what they re seeing  this is these are the kind of songs that they re listening to  the lyrics are about you know  from janam janam to expiry date is the song    yes  so this is the this is what they re watching  this is what they think is cool  this is  this is the hip and happening stuff  i m little  i think by the time you came the janam janam was over  isn t it    no  it was still there  it was in the middle somewhere  the music was wonderful  the lyrics was still lovely but today it is munni badhnaam ho gayi and it things things have really moved to chewing gums and i m forgetting at this moment what the lyrics are but then its  its its  shallow right now  india has the youngest population in the world right now so with such a young nation growing up on this  this is the feed i m just a little concerned as to what they will turn out to be   i m sure your parents were concerned too   they   okay  so  can i  i m sure my parents were very concerned when i was growing up  so  every parent has this concern  every generation has this concern that the next generation is going wrong always  i understand what you re saying this sudden change if every generation likes to go one step beyond where the previous generation has stepped in  on eve almost everything just for the sake of doing something different or it s natural they ve grown up in one atmosphere they take it to another level   they move to the next level   yes  next is not always next  that s what you re saying  next is not always next  right   yes  it s not higher  okay   it s somewhere else  it s just  it s  it s just next  so  this concern is always there but right now the change that is happening is not the next it is a serious influence because in the last fifteen years the world s ability to communicate across cultures and borders is so heavy and so unprecedented  nobody has ever been used to these kind of influences before  okay  never before this level of influence on our young people never before possible no other generation has ever experienced this kind of onslaught from so many directions and the volume of influence is too big  so in terms of changes are happening not  it is not next it is simply somewhere and nobody knows where it is because it s too complex and too mixed  nobody knows where it is including the young people  it s just a mix of things  so this is because of a sudden onslaught of information and communication  it s not for us to judge whether it s good or bad  it is just that definitely this level of information   when i say information  it s like when we were growing up i believe it was true for your generation also we  we never knew what is boredom  okay  this was  there was no such thing  we were just excited about everything that came our way  but you see today twelve year old kids  if you tell them what   ahhm   yes    you see they re just bored because they know the whole cosmos there it s they have seen it on their phone screen not even on a computer screen  on the phone screen they ve seen the entire cosmos  they know everything  things that you do not know they know  you ask them they know it   yes   by information by the time they re eighteen they have had five love affairs and gone   in the western world it s like that here also it s beginning to happen  okay  so by the time they re eighteen they ve seen everything that you need to see with body  mind  emotion  okay  by the time they re twenty five what  what next   what next  yes   no  you will see  this is not my wish but this is something that i see the way people s minds are working  the way they re being led in with information   i m not a  by any standards a pessimistic person but i m just seeing this if this level of information continues and it will multiply many fold for the coming generations  you should not be surprised in the next fifty to hundred years if fifty percent of the human population choose to commit suicide you should not be surprised because that is what will happen to the mind   somebody is clapping  look at this it s popular    no you have just touched a chord and that s  no  i m saying  we think we realize something   today  today this day more people commit suicide in this world than all the wars and murders and accidents manage to kill  so more people are on self help already than murderers  war mongers  bad drivers  everything put together  more people are on self help  and if this level of information onslaught continues on human mind   i know the nature of mind absolutely because i know my mind  i know how it works  what it can handle  what it cannot do  i know it clearly what human mind is  that s the reason why i don t have to read people s books or listen to their entire thing if they say one sentence i know what their mind is because i know the structure of human mind entirely  otherwise i wouldn t be who i am  so i m saying this  if this level of information onslaught continues at the same phase or at higher phase  which is possible in the next few years  this will definitely lead to wanting to terminate yourself because there would be nothing to live for  there is no joy and excitement about anything  you please watch your children by the time they re twelve  fifteen they re just bored  you look back at your own life those of you who are over fifty years of age just look back at in  or  on your own life  when you were twelve  fifteen was there any room for you to get bored about anything  simply you are excited about every little thing  isn t it   yeah   today you will see it s almost a common feature twelve  fifteen year old kids are just bored only thing is    yes  they are all on ipad s and iphones  yes  they are on gadgets   because we re talking about love and life   all this will not mean nothing because you had one love affair when you were eighteen years of age  you thought this is your life and you re going to  willing to die for it  whether you died for it or not but at least at that time you thought you ll die for it  okay  today by the  on facebook they had twenty two love affairs going simultaneously   it just means nothing  i  i m not saying they should have it or not have it  all i m saying is this will lead to a certain overload on the mind and suddenly a human being will think why am i here  you know that big shakespearian question  to be or not to be   yes   this is not the most intelligent question   unfortunately people think so this is only because you have not been touched by life  you are not a piece of life  you re just a psychological case  you are full of thoughts and emotions  you have not touched life at all  you think your thoughts and la  emotions are life  no  your thoughts and emotions are the drama that you are creating in your mind  it is your cinema  you must be able to end it somewhere  if you do not know how to put  the end  then it s going on endless cinema you re going crazy  life is happening here  you know your work is not life  your family is not life  your career is not life  your cinema is not life  your thought is not life  your emotion is not life  life is happening here  everything else is accessories to life  now the frills of life have become larger than life itself  life is entirely missed  if you touch life within you  then it s an explosion of energy  when such a thing never happens to you  because you have information about the whole cosmos on your phone screen  you ll never be touched by life because too much information  too much thought  even emotion is drying up  too much thought  this has happened  if you look at european philosophy in the last hundred  hundred and fifty years you will see if you read dostoyevsky you will want to commit suicide  brilliant  intellectually brilliant but you will wonder why are you alive because intellect is like that  if you wake up in the morning devoid of any  touching any life s experience within you don t think about your child s face  do not think about the flowers in the garden  birds in the sky  nothing beautiful that ever touched you just think logically you have to get out of bed that s not a small feat  you have to brush your teeth  breakfast  go to work  eat  work  eat  sleep again tomorrow morning same thing  next fifty years you have to do the same process every day  if you look at it one hundred percent logically and intellectually you will have no reason to live today morning tomorrow morning  it s only if you re touched by something suddenly it s worth living  if you re not touched by anything then it s not worth living  what is  what is so worth living about a human being   waking up in the morning  totking  tro  tr  you know troding  through life  trudging through life everyday eating  sleeping  same rubbish  what is the point  there is no point  unless you re touched by something  some magic of life if it doesn t touch you either in the form of love or in the form of a flower or in the form of something within you  if something doesn t sparkle within you definitely there is a question whether i should live or not  isn t it  and we are taking humanity in that direction with this overload of information  information is not knowing  information is just garbage collection  you just gather things which don t mean anything to you  you look smart in a tea party but you re not smart with life  okay  if you re smart with life you must be blissful  isn t it   if you re really smart with life you must be joyful and blissful  isn t it so  you re only smart in a tea party because you know when somebody is talking something   you know the galaxy z22  what happens there  everybody   wow   they can also open the internet and the same thing  you see  you think this guy visited the galaxy    so sadhguruji then what is it  okay so for all of us  give us in clear simple  simple sentences   do this and you will be at least on the way to be blissful or happy or aware or living in a nice conscious way    see if you  if you just observe  if everybody makes a little effort  everybody take a little time for this piece of life  okay  not for your family  not for your career  not for something else  something else  just for this piece of life give it little time because this is the most important piece of life in your life  isn t it  yes or no   yes   even if you re in love with somebody   still this is the most important piece of life  isn t it  so pay some attention to this  how does it happen  why have you taken it for granted  believe me you re not going to be here for an ever  i ll bless you with a long life but you re going to fall dead one day   yes or no   yes   so do not take this for granted  if you wake up in the morning tomorrow if you wake up in the morning  no this is not my wish but i want you to know of all that people who go to bed tonight  over a million people will not wake up tomorrow morning and tomorrow if you and me wake up tomorrow morning  is it not a fantastic thing  a million people did not wake up  you woke up  is it not a great thing   yes   just look at the ceiling and smile  you are still awake   you re still there  a million people did not get up in the morning and you woke up and for many  many millions of people somebody  who is dear to them did not wake up  so just check those five  six people around you they all woke up   wow  it s a fantastic day   you woke up and everybody who matters to you around you woke up  is it not fantastic day   yes   you don t think so   yes   yes  yes   you don t seem to think so because the problem is just this you are living with an idea that you are immortal  when i say you re immortal  you re not actually thinking you re immortal but you re not conscious of your mortality  if you re not conscious of your mortality  somewhere you think you re immortal  isn t it  how many moments in a day are you conscious that you re mortal  if you were conscious would you have time to crib  would you have time to fight with somebody  would you have time to do some rubbish with your life  if you knew if you re conscious that you are mortal you would do nothing other than what is absolutely needed for you and everybody around you  this one thing if you do if you just remind yourself you don t think this is a negative thing  death is not a negative thing  it s the only thing which has added value to your life  if you re here forever you would be unbearable    yeah   yes  yes   isn t it  aren t we glad everybody dies one day   if you just become conscious of this one thing that always you re conscious that  i m mortal  you don t have to think  i will die today  we don t intend  we want to live as far as possible  just you know  one day i will die  if you re just conscious of this one thing you will naturally become spiritual  you will not become spiritual by thinking about god  you will become unrealistic  hallucinatory  you will start talking to somebody  you will start doing all kinds of things  already people  you know they have ear phones on and they re talking you don t know whether they ve lost it or they   ten years ago if somebody was walking on the street talking you would know that he s lost but today you don t know   whether they got their head phones on or they just lost it and they re talking  we cannot make out  but if you are conscious that you re mortal every moment of your life  spiritual process has begun for you  so the one  one of the main reasons  one of the fundamental reasons why that all these things have to be taught to you that she is repeatedly asking this question  were you born special  did you have normal birth or not  is simply because most people have forgotten they are mortal  they think they re immortal  they may not actually think they re immortal but they re not conscious they are mortal  with every step with every breath if they were conscious of this  you know how consciously they would live  they would become fantastic  it is your mortality which makes you  want to know what is the nature of your existence  you really want to know where you came from  where you will go only when it sinks into you all this drama pup   one day it will end but right now you think only others appear in obituary columns  you are only going to read it    that was  that was simply beautiful   that s all that s needed if you want to know the value of life just know that it s a brief happening  the time that you spend here as life it s a very relative experience  if you re truly joyful and ecstatic  it s horribly brief  believe me  i feel like i was born day before yesterday  see already how i have become    okay    yes  yes   but on a particular day if you re depressed or miserable  one day seems like an endless thing  so  only miserable people have a looooooooong life   if you re a joyful  ecstatic person life is always brief  if you live to be hundred it s still very brief  for what possibilities a human being carries  for the immensity of what a human being is   it s too brief a life  if you re given hundred years  two hundred years it s still  still too brief because before you know what s happening before you exp  exp  explore a few dimensions of life it ll be over  it ll be over  over  okay  only miserable people have a very long life  they feel it s very long    sadhguruji here we have a few questions the first stion is from prabhas sundaras  sundar sen   where and how do we draw the line between loving unconditionally and becoming a doormat    see we need to understand this   what s being right now passed around as love is generally a mutual benefit scheme you give me this  i ll give you that  if you don t give me that i don t give you this this is not said but it s done    okay    it s done  isn t it  it s not said  so  human beings have physical  psychological  emotional  economic  social and various other kinds of needs  to fulfill these things when you say  i love you  instead of making these things ugly needs that we have to ugly transactions that we have to do   you give me this  you give me that to bring some aesthetic and beauty to this transaction  we quote it with a certain amount of sweetness of emotion which we call as love affair where the transactions happen more smoothly because once we are human somehow doing basic transactions in a basic way makes us feel ugly  if you take food with both your hands and eat it  it s ugly  isn t it  we want to eat in a certain way  similarly to fulfill our physical needs  emotional needs  economic needs we have arrangements  where we can conduct this in a more aesthetic manner  i m not saying it s right or wrong  this is the fact of life  so  this level of love  i call this this is enough for  to fulfill the domestic needs of one s you know for two people to live together  to fulfill their needs  to produce children  to raise them  domestic level of love affair people can have  but if people want to have a love affair which will bring them to an ultimate union  then not many people are competent to do that  not people  not many people are ready to have that kind of a love affair where it ll make two lives into one  two becomes actually one in experience that will need something more  most people are competent of using love to fulfill the domestic needs but to go beyond that they are not ready  when i say they re not ready  either i m not talking about this person or that person  so when one is ready and another is not ready or one is making an effort and another doesn t have the effort  then it feels like somebody is becoming a doormat  that is what it is that it feels like they re being exploited but above all  one who is longing to become  use love as a way of ultimate union should not be bothered about being doormat  this and that  in india we have a culture where by choice people name themselves as slaves  you know ramdas  krishnadas  this das  that das what is this  they re openly saying  i m a slave  i m a doormat  i want to be a doormat  they are not saying   i m afraid i ll be used as a doormat  they re saying   i want to be doormat  so  this is a kind of love that they re wanting to use to use for ultimate union  this is not for domestic purposes  so  if you re looking for ultimate union then love is a different affair  if you re looking for conducting of domestic affairs then you must manage dignity  who gets what  if anybody is using more than what they should then if you don t give me that i don t give you this  okay  otherwise if you re looking for ultimate union you should not think of all these things  that s a different affair  that s not for normal social thing  if you fall in love itself you become vulnerable to somebody   yes   without becoming vulnerable there is no love affair  you have to fall  when you fall  somebody may raise you or somebody may walk over you    yes   but the thing is the the experience of your life is beautiful because you fell not because they raised you  not because they walked over you  because you could actually have the sense of abandon in you to fall  that was the beauty of your love affair not what they gave you  what they did to you  this   no  the beauty was you sat alone and you think you really loved this person so much you re willing to die  that was the most beautiful moment   not the moment they gave you a big gift  not the moment they gave you a diamond ring  not the moment they said this and that about you   no  you just sat here and you re willing to die  that was the moment  not just a doormat  you re willing to be the dust on their feet  okay  i m not saying you should be like that   i m saying where love transformed itself into a devotion  if you fall in love itself you become very vulnerable but there are still some shreds of sanity in love affairs that you can recover  but if you become a devotee there is no sanity left and you cannot recover  so  before you tread such a land you must see whether you re for it or not  what are your goals first of all  if your goal is to make a life a cautioned  a very measured love affair is good but you re  your  your thing is you want to dissolve into the process of life you don t want to have a good life  you re not planning to have a good life you just want to become explosion of life  you don t care what you get and what you don t get  then you become a devotee  a devotion means it s your intention to dissolve into your object of devotion  so a devotee is not expecting whether i ll become a doormat or a crown on somebody s head  whatever i become as long as i can touch your feet or head or whatever  it s fine with me   yeah   so that s a different state of existence  i don t think somebody who is looking for domestic level of love affair should even ask that question    mmm  we have one question from the social media the facebook   amitmadan wants to know in this materialistic age the real feeling of love is disappearing from our life  most of the love we receive from others and express to others is superficial  how can we reinforce the real feeling of love in our own life and in others   forget about others  if you if you learn to be loving by your own nature not because of somebody else or something else i know the question is coming from facebook  there s an enormous possibility   you can even love those people who don t even exist   so  i m saying it s a tremendous possibility so  if you just become love  not love somebody then you will know the nature of love  if you love somebody it s a fickle happening because no human being will happen hundred percent the way you want them  every human being on this planet is going to disappoint you  believe me  not because they ll do something wrong because nobody can fulfill the unrealistic expectation you have of them  it s simply not possible  have you been able to fulfill anybody s expectation i m asking you entirely  partially but never entirely  isn t it  so nobody else will be able to do it unless you re a still such a hopeless romantic you re still waiting that ideal person is going to come from somewhere   no  believe me whoever comes  i want you to know the ideal people whom you worship  when krishna was there his wives complained   all right   so there is no hope for us  yes  please remember this   okay  sadhguruji this is where we open yes the platform  its  anybody has a question this is the moment   my name is ananth  my question is about marriage  divorce   no  no  they are two different things    what i see today is many youngsters like many of them they don t want to marry and few of them who marry there are occasions where they are getting divorced  so would you like to throw some light on this situation sadhguru   see  you need to understand the institution of marriage  one thing is as we said a little while ago it s about bringing a certain sanctity to the simple basic needs that every human being has  i will repeat there are physical needs  there are psychological needs  there are economic needs  emotional needs  social needs  variety of needs  to fulfill all these things we set up an institution called marriage where all these can be conducted in a sensible manner  otherwise if we did it on the streets like every other creature it would turn ugly for us  and we will feel not good about it  so  to bring some sense of organization  some aesthetic  some stability  because man and woman coming together naturally brought fresh life  the nature of human life  the nature of human offspring is such that because of the possibilities that a human being carries  it is  compared to any other creature  it is the most helpless life which needs maximum amount of support  you could leave a puppy on the street  as long as he gets food  he grows up into a good dog  no problem  but not so with a human being  he doesn t need just physical support  he needs variety of support and stab  above all the stable situation  whether there should be marriage in society or not one will debate when they are eighteen because physical body is asking for freedom  all right  at that time everybody questions   is marriage really needed  why can t we just live whichever way we want  but when you are three years of age you valued marriage immensely  a stable marriage immensely  isn t it so  yes or no   yes  yes   not yours  your parents   the parents  yes    when you were three  four of yours three  four years of age you re one hundred percent for marriage again when you become forty five  fifty again you re hundred percent for marriage between and eighteen and thirty five you re questioning the whole process   okay   that s true    i m not saying marriage is the thing but do you have a better alternative  if you have a better alternative  damn the marriage but you have not come up with a better alternative because a stable situation is a must for a child  once you have a child it s a twenty year project   okay  that is if they do well  if they don t do well it s a lifelong project   so if you want to get into such projects at least twenty years there must be a commitment to create a stable situation  your whims and fancies will change  your emotions will change  if that is what it is  don t get into such situations  it s not compulsory for everybody to get married  it s good young pe  you were saying people are thinking whether to get married  i m glad it is not necessary for everybody but if you get into it and if you  especially if you get into children you must understand  it s a minimum twenty year project whether you like it or you don t like it  otherwise you shouldn t get into those projects  you don t walk into a project  drop it half way and walk away  isn t it  they have their benefits and they have their problems  it s your choice but at least choose consciously  you don t have to get married because everybody is getting married  you don t have to talk about marriage and divorce in same breath as if they come together   this is a completely an american idea  you re thinking of marriage and divorce together nobody thought of divorce in this country till recently  isn t it  why should you ever talk about marriage and divorce in one breath  it s  it s a crime  it s really a crime to think on those lines  but if it so happens something truly went wrong between two people and they have to separate that will any way inevitably happen  you don t have to plan it at the time of wedding    namaskaram sadhguru  namaskaramjuhi mam  you mentioned about survival and you talked about aesthetics of life  i would like i would request you to elaborate on aesthetics of life and my second question is for my friend   i don t know whether you will answer it or not but i just want to mention it over here because she has requested me to do so  her question is what is the purpose of this universe   oh  tell your friend i didn t make it    thank you so much   why am i being blamed for these things   i the only thing i have done is i ve figured the nature of my life and by figuring the nature of this life i know by inference every life has happened the same way  not just every life  the very cosmos has happened the same way  if you know the nature of this life from its origin to its ultimate you know the nature of everything by inference  everything that s worth knowing  so  tell your friend i didn t make this universe so don t blame me for such big things  i just figured my way through my life and we should figure it if you figure it you will see the most important thing that s happening in your life right now is that you re alive  nothing else  not that stocks have gone up today that s not the most important thing  not your love affair  not this and that   if you don t understand what i m saying suppose tomorrow you lost  i m not saying you must wish i m not wishing you must loose but suppose tomorrow you lost half your money and you re feeling depressed and your mind says i want to die  close your mouth  hold your nose like this  for two minutes  your body says to hell with your money  i want to live   tomorrow you found your  love affair collapsed and your mind says i want to die  check    the life within you says to hell with your love affair  i want to live  every time you feel little suicidal or depressed just check   the life within you says to hell with all these things  i want to live  so  i want to know the most important thing that s happening to you right now is life itself  not the fancy thoughts that you have  not the emotions that you have  not financial arrangements or family arrangements or whatever rubbish you have built around you these are all accessories to life  these are all frills  frills are so much you re missing the skirt  that s the whole problem with you   yes  so much frill fundamental things are forgotten   so this is the most important thing  right now for most people life means their job  life means the new house they re building  life means the car that they bought  life means their wife  their husband  their children   no  life means what s throbbing here   not even your body  not your mind  not your thought  not your emotion  what is right now throbbing here  this is life  because this is on everything else seems to be meaningful  if this one stops nothing around you means any damn thing to you or to anybody
