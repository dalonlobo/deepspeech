 namaskaram  on this guru poornima  my best wishes and blessings to all of you  the significance of this day  in terms of exploring human possibilities  is unparalleled because it s on this day a little over 15 000 years ago  that adiyogi for the first time chose to turn himself into a means of transmission  transmitting a dimension which was unheard of till then  predating all religion  predating all ideologies  for the first time  he brought this possibility into human life that if you are willing to strive  if you are willing to strive  you can cross all the limitations that have been set upon you by your own means or by nature  you can transcend all this if you are willing to strive  he not only said this  he not only opened up this possibility  he expounded the entire science and technologies and various methods and practices through which an individual human being can rise beyond all limitations  the idea of transcendence only happened on this day  the idea of transcendence was first brought into to the human race only on this day  so this day has always been celebrated as one of the most significant days for those who are aspiring to be something more than who they are right now  tell me one person who is not aspiring to be something more than what he or she is right now  it is just that each person is aspiring to be something more within the limitations of what they know  one person s idea of something more may be money  another person s idea of something more may be wealth  another person s idea of something more may be knowledge  love  pleasure  but there is no human being who is not aspiring to be something more than what they are right now  the aspiration is universal  the currency employed for this aspiration may be of various kinds  now the question is   how many who aspire for this something more  realize that more is not going to fulfill this being   if you get that something more that you are aspiring for today  tomorrow you will aspire for something more  if that happens  something more because this  is not aspiring for more  this is aspiring for all  so he brought this awareness to start with  with the seven sages who gathered around him  today  they are celebrated in this country as sapta rishis and they in turn brought it to humanity in so many different ways  the significance of the day is that  that it is a shift it is the first full moon day after the shifting of the solstice  this time  certain calendar adjustments have moved it to the second  but normally it is the first full moon day  it is also a time when the sun begins to move southward in relation with this planet on which we are  so  it is also a time  which is a time which is best for receiving grace for variety of reasons  so  this day was one day  which was universally celebrated in this part of the world at one time  this system of celebrating guru poornima and becoming available to grace got dislocated only after the british took over and made sure that you have to go to office on that day   so  this grand celebration that used to happen across the country in this entire region  not just in india kind of got little dislocated because it is a day when you have to go to work  so things got disturbed  but still  in this country at least  still millions and millions of people are conscious that this is a day of grace  this is a day they can easily become available to grace and hence it s lived on  a time has come in the history of humanity  where our ability to do things in the outside world has almost become superhuman  when i say superhuman  i want you to understand  a thousand years ago or even a hundred years ago  what an individual human being could do and what an individual human being can do today  simply because of the aid of science and technology  is literally superhuman  i am sure a hundred years ago  if you pulled out something from your pocket and spoke to somebody in america right now  people would definitely think you are superhuman or more  believe me  if you had a cellphone hundred years ago  you could have claimed you re god and they would have believed it  you just got your phones too late   so  once humanity is empowered like this on various levels  it s extremely important that raising of human consciousness becomes of paramount importance  and raising of human consciousness essentially means this  that your longing to expand  wanting to be something more you find a vehicle through which you can expand limitlessly  so  adiyogi on this day transmitted one hundred and twelve ways in which one can expand limitlessly  hundred and twelve ways   enough variety for you   if you don t like one  you can pick the other   one hundred and twelve ways in which you can attain to a limitless expansion  so  here we are on this day and i am supposed to hang out   when we generally say hangout we mean just  it s a gossipy session  so no problem  because when it comes to inner dimensions  you can only gossip because  you cannot talk about it  you can only talk around it  so  we can only gossip  so  it s appropriate  we just hanging out with you  please  the very first question in our google hangout session is from an online participant called cyrus from maryland  usa  and cyrus  question sadhguru is that many people firmly believe that people do not require a guru to become enlightened  rather  they believe that the power to become enlightened lies within us and is within our control  is it realistic to think that we can achieve enlightenment without a guru   in maryland  now  if we have to learn something as simple as abc  alphabets  twenty six only in english language   samskrit  has fifty four  tamil has two hundred odd  twenty six only  twenty six alphabets  how many of you believe that if you did not have a teacher  you would have learnt these twenty six alphabets  that s the answer    and especially if you want to walk an uncharted path  new terrain  if you go into new terrain  it is sensible to take instructions  believe me  otherwise  you could try an adventure but even those who adventure  these days use a gps  earlier  they used maps or they listened to the locals  those who do not want to listen to another human being who has already walked the terrain and think they can do it by themselves nothing wrong  i am not saying they cannot  they can  why not  after all  you are only trying to walk the inner territory  it s just that what you could do in a short span of time  you may do it in a million years  if i ask you i think almost all of you are wearing a watch  this is not some rocket science  just a watch  they have been ticking around for hundreds of years now  i will give you all the parts of this watch  dismantle and give it to you  put it together  let me see  no  no  i am not asking you to manufacture a watch  it s all there  we ll dismantle it and give it to you  put it together let me see  we will give you a manual  how to do it  please do it and see  let me see  you will have a watch but you won t tick   similarly on the spiritual path  without guidance you want to go   all the best   no problem  it s just that unnecessary  unnecessary hardship you will create for yourself  if you like it the hard way   fine  what s the problem  some people like suffering  they think nothing good can come out of life unless you suffer  if you are if you are that kind  it s all right  but my intention my intention is people should walk this path blissfully  joyfully   ecstatic if it s possible   if you want to go on a tour joyfully  better to go on a guided tour  believe me   please   our next question is from the international cricketing legend and well loved indian batsman virender sehwag    oh  he speaks with his bat   it s a technology issue  it s not him  okay    i m afraid i will have to read the question while we sort out the audio issue  the question is   why don t people just share their knowledge sadhguru  why do they withhold it  why don t they share it the way you do   oh  this is the age of intellectual property   somebody even wants to patent yogasanas  you can patent the asana but still you can t get into it   you may have patented all the difficult asanas but can you get into it   that s the question  so  we have come to a place in the world  where everything is monetized  everything has a commercial angle to it  so  because of that  as people have been miserly with money  now they are miserly with knowledge  because you know  knowledge is money  so they are miserly with that because it s money in some way  so  this monetizing of everything can really destroy many things in this world  in this culture  we always fixed it like this   spiritual process  health related things and education  these three things should never be commercialized  everything else can be commercialized  these three things should always be offered   the question is only about the qualification of the recipient  all kinds of people come and say   i want to go  i want to do this  i want to do that  two days later  they won't be here  so  the question is only about the qualifications of the recipient  if that one thing is ensured  knowledge should be offered irrespective of commercial interests that are involved in it  but today  everything is commercialized and in many ways  you can t help it because the whole momentum is in that direction  virender may be willing to share his knowledge  he may teach ten different people how to hold the bat  how to hit the ball  how to stand  how to do this  how to do that  but how many will go about scoring double centuries after double centuries   because to get a qualified recipient is not easy  it s not easy  knowledge may be there  when it comes to experiential knowing  how many people are willing to receive it  everybody says   yes  i every day meet people    all the way  sadhguru  i want to go all the way    tomorrow morning  they are crying because somebody said something  they want to leave  day after tomorrow morning  their uncle s daughter s birthday they want to go   i am not saying there s anything wrong with your uncle s daughter   all i am saying is your interests are many  that means you are not going anywhere  you can dabble with many but there must be one direction to life  otherwise you are not going far  you re going to wander around here  if you want to go  penetrate through something and go a distance  you need some one pointedness  people come here  they say   sadhguru  you give me any kind of sadhana  i am willing to die  sadhguru    i say   don t die  hold it   i am willing to offer anything  but hold it  we will see  we will go step by step  three days later  they come and say  sadhguru  you know sadhguru  i have i have found somebody sadhguru  i think for lifetimes this person must have been waiting for me  i saw this girl and phoo    now  now there is a spiritual angle to it   it looks like for lifetimes we have known each other    if you have known somebody for lifetimes and you didn t make it  it s best you keep away from them  because for most people  their direction of life keeps changing every other day  it s hard to offer anything  it s all bits and pieces  of course  there are also people who think  see knowledge is not something that you own because knowledge is not about you  knowledge is about the creation  about the nature of the creation  what is already there is what you have absorbed  you didn t invent it  you didn t come up with it  you only saw it  this is why the language in this country is very clear  when it comes to any kind of spiritual dimension  we are only talking about realization  realizing means something that was always there  always right here  but you were so stupid you didn t see it  today you saw it  i realized  i did not attain  i did not arise  i did not climb somewhere  i just realized  but the thing was always here  so  what is here all the time as truth cannot belong to somebody  nobody can stop you from it but those who have access   if they have truly accessed   they will never block you  they will never hold back  only those who have accumulated from books and stuff  they will hold back because any accumulated stuff is limited and it will get over  if you give away everything  it will get over tomorrow morning  you won t know what to do  so  you will hold it and be miserly because you have gathered it  what is gathered you can hold back  what you have realized you cannot hold back because it s an endless run  you only constantly wishing there is somebody here  who can soak it up as fast as you can give it  that is the problem  the problem is of lack of receptivity  not of holding back    if you really know  but if you have acquired knowledge you will be miserly because you can only acquire that much  you don t want it  don t want it to get over  knowledge is like money again   it can get over    our next question comes from bryn  who is a circus performer and teacher based in france  i m afraid i have to read this question as well while the technical difficulties are being sorted out  bryn s question is   people living in western societies have many distractions at every corner  how do we maintain a focus in our daily lives to best receive what you have to offer   oh  the distraction is not only in the west   for those who want to be distracted  there is distractions everywhere  not only in the west  and not just today  even a thousand years ago people were still distracted  believe me  don t think thousand years ago  everybody was focused and fantastic   no  they were just as good as you or as bad as you   they were also hanging out in small groups   now we are hanging out globally   so  what is that one thing i have to do to be focused or to be able to receive what is offered  very simple   just remind yourself  tomorrow morning  when you wake up in the morning  just check   still alive  because every day over a million people die on this planet  you woke up tomorrow morning  over a million people did not wake up tomorrow morning will not wake up tomorrow morning  believe me  you woke up  just check   you re still there   great  isn t it  you re still alive  can you at least smile   oh i am still alive   great  just check those three four five people who really matter in your life  check if all of them are alive because if one million people die  at least ten million people lost somebody who is dear to them  isn't it  so all those who are  who really matter for you  you are alive  they are alive   fantastic today  it s a great day  isn't it   don t take this lightly  this s not a joke because  i am reminding you of this because most of you think   other people die   ah  not me  it s only others who die  no  no  you and me will die   sadhguru  i am asking a spiritual question  you re reminding me of morbid things    no  nothing morbid about it  death is the one common denominator among all of us  isn't it  yes  one thing common about us  whether you are black  white  blue  yellow  whatever kind you are  man  woman or other six genders   whatever you may be  one common denominator among all of us is  we will die one day  tch  look at the universality of death   only when you remind yourself that you are mortal  wanting to know something beyond the physicality of who you are becomes an active process  you will become receptive only when you know the body that you carry  the psychological drama that you are going through  all this is going on  but  one day  pup  it will end  very easily  it will end  believe me  you just have to wait   see  you don t have to do anything to achieve death  just have to wait  both for yours and others  people come and say   sadhguru this guy  my enemy i can t bear it  i say   just wait   you don t have to take the trouble  just wait    one way or the other you will get rid of him  either he will die or you will die laughter applause  so  do this every hour  tch 30  oh  i am still alive  great    30  you know how many people died on the planet   but it s not me  right now  now  if you are continuously conscious of your mortal nature  you will become one hundred percent alive to the spiritual dimension of who you are  only because somewhere  it s not that intellectually you do not know  but experientially you are immortal  you know  because when i look at the number of shoes you have bought   it looks like you are going to live for 10 000 years   number of clothes and shoes  when i look at them  it looks like lot of people are planning for 1 000  10 000 years of life  no  no  no  it s a brief life  if you know it s a brief life and you are definitely mortal we will try to stretch it with yoga  tch  hmm  we will try to stretch it and make it little longer  but  anyway  you will die  if you are conscious of this every moment of your life initially  because you are in europe  because particularly you are in europe and you have always believed you are immortal   it may be little struggle in  in the beginning  but still  remind yourself every minute that  i am mortal  i ll die someday and maybe it s today  come to ease with death  then the longing to know what is beyond this physical nature will burst forth within you  once this longing comes  you are one hundred percent receptive to everything that i represent    the next question comes from divya bharathi ramaswamy  who is doing an ma in computer science in zurich  switzerland   is she talking kind or no      namaskaram sadhguru  my question is   would marriage be only a hindrance if someone  spiritually     especially women  and also  for someone who has gone through    yourself  what would you say  from your experience    something about would marriage be a hindrance  something  okay   is marriage a hindrance for one s spiritual journey  see  marriage is not a commodity that you carry on your head  but many people carry it on their head  it s just an arrangement  so that socially  there is some sense to the way you fulfill the needs that you have  a human being has needs   physical  psychological  emotional  financial  social  various kinds of needs  to fulfill these things in a dignified manner  we came up with something called marriage  so that it is fulfilled within a framework  your desires don t run wild and disturb everything in the society  some kind of a framework so that it can be conducted in a sensible manner  now you have raised this to heaven because somebody told you   marriages are made in heaven    only the unmarried ones think so   so it s just two people  all right  now  spiritual process is about turning inward  can i turn inward with somebody else   marriage is an arrangement to fulfill certain aspect of your life  don t complicate life by thinking   we will walk together on the spiritual path  there is no such thing because spiritual path is not  not the path that you take into the velliangiri mountains  that you want to walk together  even if you go to velliangiri mountains  please don t walk hand in hand   it s a narrow pathway and it s not an appropriate way to walk in the forest   you can walk in the park hand in hand  you can go shopping hand in hand  you can sit in a cinema hand in hand  you can t turn inward hand in hand   now  does it mean to say someone who is married  what it let s understand this  someone who is married means someone who s made an official arrangement for their needs in life  a formal arrangement for simple needs that a human being has  which are biological  which are psychological  which are social  many things  so  these arrangements that you have made  conduct these arrangements gracefully  so there will be time and space for you to turn around  if you pay excess attention to these arrangements  then turning around will not be possible  this does not mean if you are alone  you will do it  if you are alone  you may be always looking out   you will spend your entire time and life looking out for somebody  that will also not help  if you think your desires  your longings and your needs can be well handled by an arrangement of marriage   all right  don t try to raise it to heaven  it doesn t happen in heaven  believe me  and if heaven is making so many mistakes   then we will have to seriously reconsider many things   so  of course in india  we don t blame it on the heaven  we do our own calculations  of all the arrangements of stars and planets and everything  we match all the planets and stars very well  it s very easy to match stars because they never fought ever   but to match these two people   that nobody has managed  except those two people if they are sensible   if they are sensible  they can manage it  nobody else can match these two people   priests have tried  gods have tried  ghosts and goblins have tried  it s not worked and not worked and not worked  two sensible people  they can manage  if both of them understand the limitations of the arrangement and the possibilities of the arrangement  they can conduct it sensibly  if you try to raise it to heaven  you will see it will for sure crash  so  your marriage has nothing to do with your spiritual process because your spiritual process is an inward journey  but one dimension of this is   to walk alone  people falter  actually  this question was asked to gautama the buddha   is it better to walk alone or in company  gautama looked and said   it s better to walk alone than to walk with a fool    because gautama   not me  okay    gautama believes only a fool will marry you   it s him  not me  okay   please   this is a question that comes from stephanie in malaysia   namaskaram sadhguru   namaskaram  the first one who is speaking clearly    having been to various international forums and met many great leaders  where do you see the world heading  for the better or worse   oh   let me correct that question a bit  yes  i ve been in international forums  met many leaders  you added  great  leaders   so  many leaders   not always so great  yes  there are a few great leaders  no question about that  where is the world heading   there are many possibilities because we have capabilities and technologies  which no other generation could ever dream of  will our capabilities turn against us or will they work for us is the big question  if all the human capabilities  which are so hugely enhanced because of technology everything that an individual human being could do has expanded manifold  in this enhanced state and our numbers have increased tremendously  in the beginning of twentieth century  we were just about 1 5 billion people  today we are 7 3 billion people  the united nations making predictions that by 2050  we will be 9 7 billion people  if all these people get educated  get technologically empowered  9 7 billion people or nearly 10 billion people on this planet is for sure going to be a disaster  yes  we can make arrangements and arrangements  we can improve the arrangements  we can make more energy saving machines  we can recycle the shit   yes   we can do all this but if we don t come to our senses with human populations  there s going to be i want you to just imagine  how the world will be if the population almost goes up by fifty percent tomorrow  just imagine your town  how it will be if fifty percent population increases tomorrow morning  or in other words  no matter what we create  no matter how much we strive  whether whatever we build  everything is going to be insufficient because the planet is going to be insufficient  of course  we are looking at planets which could sustain life outside of this solar system  we ve found two three very promising planets  it s just a little  you know  not in the walking distance    a few  few thousand or a million light years away  great planets  i believe  but this is the thing  but nobody wants to address this issue  everybody wants to talk about cosmetic solutions  not address the basic problem of expanding human population  i was in a conference and i said   see  unless you  unless you reduce the human footprint on the planet  there is no solution for anything  then they asked me a brilliant question   how do you reduce the human footprint  i said   you have to reduce the number of feet   that s the only way    so  right now  it doesn t matter what others think  all of you who are here and those of you who re hanging out with me  we can take it upon ourselves that we will not push the human population  you can have a dog   she is there    a husband and wife were having a debate   whether to have a child or not  the husband wanted a child  the wife hesitating because she will lose the shape of her body and you know  for a husband  having a baby is simple   but for the woman  it s too many things involved  so  debate was going on and then they came and the debate moved into an area where   should we have a baby or should we get a dog    then they could not decide  they went to a counselor  they put their problem in front of him  so  he said   you got to just make up your mind  whether you want to ruin the carpets or your life    i am not saying children are bad  they are wonderful  but it s just too many  we as human beings  we are wonderful but we are too many  we re so many that the insect population is going down   no  no  it s not a joke  it s very  it s very threatening  if the insect population disappears  the planet will be destroyed  yes  the worms disappear  the planet will be destroyed  if you and me disappear  planet will flourish   so  leave the leaders alone because in every conference that you meet  very cosmetic solutions are being talked about   how to adjust the market place  okay   how to do this  how to do that  i  on immediate scale  yes  those things are necessary  but you are talking about what is the future of this world  if that is so  if we want a future for this world  if we want our children and their children to live well on this planet  the only way is to bring down human population   not by doing some horrible acts  but if we have see  our life expectancy has improved  this means we have taken death into our hands  when we take death into our hands  it is our business to take birth also into our hands  isn't it   if we convince the population of this one thing  future is very bright  because tomorrow morning the sun will come up  what s the problem   please  the next question comes from sahil gurung from the united kingdom   namaskaram sadhguruji   namaskaram   sadhguruji  my question is   is enlightenment a gradual process or it happens when our body  mind and energies comes to a point where it is perfectly satisfied  like making a quantum leap  thank you   are you asking how it happens in uk or in india     on planet earth    so the question is   is enlightenment a gradual process or when your body  mind  energies align  is it like a quantum leap  is it something that bursts out   yes    see  the mango season is just getting over  you don t know what it is  sahil  you are in uk  mango season is getting over  in india  it s a big thing  if you looked at the mango tree in the month of october  november  december  you didn t see any sweetness dripping out of it  suddenly in january  february  flowers came  they were not as attractive as jasmine or rose flowers or something  some tiny little flowers came  suppose you do not know this is a mango tree and you tested it  you take a leaf and bite it  it was quite bitter  but suddenly in the month of april  may  huge drops of sweetness  hanging there in the tree  tch sahil  you have not eaten the mango this season    i got it from the supermarket  that s all    eh  you are  you are eating mangoes from nigeria   so  if you did not have prior prior knowledge that this is a mango tree  did you think this tree is actually manufacturing this sweetness  but you think suddenly in april  sweetness came  it has been slowly manufacturing this sweetness and it put it out at a certain season  but it s been on  right through the year  isn't it  mangoes happen only in one season  you notice the sweetness only at a certain time  this does not mean the mango tree was not striving and working to produce that sweetness  you cut any part of the mango tree and taste it   tch  you will not find  a slightest tinge of sweetness  believe me  but when the mango comes  how much sweetness  where is it coming from  it s been working on it  you couldn t see it  similarly  is it a process  for sure  it is a process  but can everybody see the process  identify the process  no  when somebody is evolving on the spiritual path  others thought he is a nutcase  somebody thought he s vagrant  somebody thought he is a vagabond  somebody thought he is something else  but when the sweetness came  everybody who tasted realized that this is a fantastic thing   so  nothing in the universe happens bang  bang  bang  everything is a process  can you identify the process  can you recognize the process is the question  generally  anybody who carries generally among human beings  when they are children  any child which carries a certain level of genius within him  which is irrepressible everybody has genius within them but they are repressible  systems in the society  their own fears  their own anxieties  their own need for security represses their genius  every human being has some kind of genius but over ninety percent of the human beings never find expression to it because they give in to other things  things become  other things become more important  when you were twelve  fifteen you thought   i ll do this  i ll do that  i ll go to the moon  but you saw the neighborhood girl  and started calling her the moon   moon disappeared   hey   so  like this  in everybody the possibility is wide open  the thing is can you sustain the process and allow it to become that possibility  between possibility and reality  there is a distance  most people neither have the courage nor the conviction to walk that distance  largely  spiritual process is a kind of an entertainment  go to discourse after discourse  discourse after discourse  read more and more books and debate how your atman  paramatman  your soul is floating here  there and about heaven and hell and everything but do nothing about this    so  it's largely  it s largely like entertainment  so  there is a process for sure  the process can be approached consciously or it may be an unconscious process but you re doing the right things  this is the beauty of this universe   whether you know or you do not know  knowingly or unknowingly  with discipline or with indiscipline  with love or with hate  if you do the right things  right things will happen to you  that is the beauty of this universe   so shankara  adi shankara said   yogarathova bhogarathova  somehow  either through yoga or bhoga  somehow do it  somehow find the truth of your inner nature because what we are considering as truth is simply this   whatever works on all levels of life must be the truth  isn't it  hmm  whatever really works on all levels of life must be the truth  whatever you know in your life  test it right now  because you have a mind which can project  right now  you are striving for a certain level of income or a certain kind of house or a car or something else or something else  put yourself in different stages of life and see if it still means a lot to you  see  suppose not tomorrow  let s say hundred years later  you are on your deathbed  just see if your jewelry  your make up  your car will mean something to you on that day  this does not mean you must give it up today  it is just that you must keep it in its place  you must not carry it in your heart    there is a difference between using something and being used by something  most people most people do not know how to use the things that they buy  the things that they buy are using them up  they are enslaving the human being  whatever things you want to use  you can use  that s not an issue  but the problem is you let those things use you  this is not okay  so if you just take care that you are not used by anything  you understand the limited role that everything has in your life   the limited role of your education  the limited role of your career  the limited role of your marriage  the limited role of your relationships  the limited role of your wealth  the limited role of everything that you are doing   if you understand where one thing begins and where it ends  then you don t have to do anything  spiritual process is on   when the season is right  the flowers will bloom and mangoes will come     the next question  comes from a prominent figure in indian public life  this is the honorable minister of state for culture  tourism and civil aviation  dr  mahesh sharma   thank you sadhguruji  you gave me opportunity to mark this celebration of guru poornima utsav with this much big presence over here  but a big question comes to my mind that we keep  and especially the indians keep after the god and parents  guru at the highest esteem  but we have not been able to make guru poornima celebration utsav in the same spirit of high spirit as we respect the gurus   i kind of addressed this already in the beginning but anyway  the reason why guru poornima and so many other things  which were of great spiritual importance in this country  have slid back into the background of our lives is   because we have been an occupied nation for a period of time and whatever the framework that the occupying forces set for us  when we got our independence  we should have looked at what kind of framework we want for our nation  we did not do that  we just allowed the same framework to continue  for example  in this country  right from ancient times  even for a farmer who ploughs the land  even today many farmers don t set their plough on their land on monday mornings  yes  in tamil nadu  it s still true  in the north  it s been given up because no no animals being used  all tractors  you have to you have taken a bank loan  the interest is ticking  so you want it to run all the seven days   all these things  when the british came  they changed these things because they  they knew the strength of this nation was essentially in the culture  so they wanted to break the culture  very systematically  they engineered how to break the culture  they made you sunday holiday  what are you going to do on sunday  watch television and eat potato chips   what are you going to do on sunday  they had an intention for a sunday morning  what is the intention for the majority of the population in this country on sunday morning  there is nothing for us to do on sunday morning  monday morning  there re lots of things happening  but you have to go to office  for a long time in this country  the monthly holidays were like this   pournami means every pournami means three days holiday   one day before  the day and the next day  amavasya means two days holiday   these these two days of full moon day and new moon day have something to do with our system   something to do with the planet  something to do with the very way we re born  we are physically here today only because our mothers  bodies were in sync with the cycles of the moon  otherwise we won t be here  so  there are things which are happening in your system  as you know  the very oceans are rising on these days  when such a massive body of water is rising up  this body  which is over seventy percent water  you think nothing is rising in this   that  the  those days were kept as spiritually significant days  those are not the days to go to work  those are the days to focus upon yourself  so  similarly the guru poornima used to be a huge festival across the this whole region  but it s gone because people have to go to work  so  i request you  being you being a minister in the union cabinet  this is something that you must do   that i know for you to pitch for every pournima pournami being a holiday is not going to be practical  but at least guru poornima   if you from the federal government  from the central government  if you declare guru poornima as a holiday  i will make sure guru poornima is celebrated across this country  with great fervor  because because the spirit is still alive  there is no space for expression  there is no space or time for expression  please  if you can do this one thing  and we can make guru poornima a big tourism attraction for this country  as as i have already spoken to you about making india the spiritual gateway  guru poornima can be the day which really draws spiritual tourists from across the world to this country  so  even as a part of your job   it s a good thing to do     sadhguru  the next question comes from heena parekh  a twenty year old student from northampton in the united kingdom   sadhguru  what is the significance of initiation   okay  what is the significance of initiation  initiation is not about a bundle of instructions  in fact  in any initiation process  instructions are a kind of disturbance  it s a nuisance  i am saying it s a nuisance because we are still giving instructions because most people because today they have all become educated  everything has to be told  you know  or it must be printed  these days  if you tell them also it s not enough  they wanted a printed sheet  the instructions of the initiation because they are all educated  their brains are full of words  not of life  too many words  so everything has to be verbal  even saying it is not good enough  you have to print it or you have to record it and give it to them so that they can put headphones and listen to the instructions every time  initiation is not a bundle of words  if we have to use an analogy  if you know something about electricity   in electrical imple  you know  motors and stuff  there is something called as induction  the power is there  the motor is there  everything is there  but without an induction switch it will not go  all the ingredients are there but still it will not happen because there s no induction of energy  so initiation is like an induction  you have all the ingredients to be meditative but it doesn t happen   why does it not happen  because this is the way the creation itself happened  if you go by the traditional explanation   one way  if you go by the modern scientific way   it s the same thing said in a different language  modern science is talking about how everything was empty space  now they are removing the word empty and saying it was space  there is no physicality there but there seems to be something else there  what that something else  we don t know  as per the science  and today they ve made experiments where in vacuum state  if you apply a certain energy around it   not into it  around it   suddenly virtual protons and virtual neutrons will spill out  that means creation begins just because there s energy playing around  there is a beautiful story in the yogic tradition  shiva you must understand the word shiva  shiva means  shi va means that which is not  appropriate description for space  that which is  is physical creation  that which is not  is non physical dimension of the existence  so shiva means that which is not  shiva was lying  his body spread across the cosmos  but he is not  he doesn t exist  he doesn t have a physical manifestation  then shakti  a certain dimension of energy  came and danced around him and then he came alive  then he started spitting galaxies out of his mouth  this is the most  appropriate description of how creation happened  still spitting galaxies  new galaxies  it s continuously happening  simply because a certain energy touched it  everything that was needed for creation was already there in him but he needed induction  so  initiation is a kind of an induction process  but unfortunately today  if i just ask people to just sit here  we ll do things for you  they ll       nothing happening  why is he not doing anything    you are supposed to say something  so what to do  for modern times  we say a lot of things  we hang out with you   today if you go and sit in the dhyanalinga temple  without instruction you can become meditative  i can do that to you here now  what's her name  heena  heena  you are in uk  if you re willing to just sit there  i can do it to you now  wherever you are  but right now  you got too you are a student  still educating   maybe you are a possibility  not fully educated   too many words in your head  the only thing you understand is words  because of that  instructions have come  otherwise  initiation is not about instruction  there really no instruction in it  initiation is just an induction process  it s an energy process  but we have to talk about energy  tch  you know  we have to talk a lot about energy before they open their mouth and   ohh  appadiya    tough times for gurus   too much talking   if you don t talk  nobody will be here  very few can really understand   if we simply sit here and reverberate  they will also sit here and reverberate  those numbers are small  well  in isha  those numbers are increasing  i don t have to say much   but in the larger world  you have to  tch  you have to talk  talk  talk and talk  hang out with people    global gossip   our next online participant is manj musik  a well known punjabi hip hop singer   ohh   and he prefers to call his input an offering  rather than a question   hope the audio works    the next question comes from sameer oberoi  an advertising professional in gurgaon  and his question  sadhguru  is   i hope to visit the ashram for mahashivarathri next year because i have been inspired by your description of shiva as the ultimate outlaw  can you tell us something more about this fascinating figure    shiva being the ultimate outlaw   you must understand what is outlaw  many of you have suffered the in laws   i hope you won t meet too many outlaws  but when we say the ultimate outlaw  you must understand all laws   all laws   are of some meaning only in the physical sphere of life  see suppose you did not have a body   i want you to just imagine yourself  you don t have a body   what law do you have to follow   you can go wherever you want  you can do whatever you want  yes  only because you have a body   where to go  where not to go  what to do  what not to do  only in the physical realm  the laws have a meaning  one who has transcended the physical  he has no laws  so he is a outlaw  he is out of all laws  this is what spiritual process means   within yourself  you are out of all laws because once you transcend your physical nature  none of the laws bind you  in the society   yes  but within yourself   no  because you are an outlaw because you are out of the physical nature  so in that context  he is the ultimate outlaw and mahashivarathri is his day  the significance of the day is that on that day  there is a phenomenal upsurge of energy within the human system  this is why on that night  you are not supposed to sleep  you must keep your spine vertical so that you make use of this natural upsurge within you  so on that night  there is a huge festival here  this year  this is going to be a mega festival because we have crossed the twenty one year cycle  this is a new cycle  and it is going to be a phenomenal event  you must  you are in gurgaon  not too far away  you must be here on that day  it s an incredible night and we will have many things happening on that night  we are  already our teams are working to make this into a major possibility for every human being and we will also make it happen across the country and in many parts of the world in various cities  having video feeds and stuff  though there is a time difference in the other countries  and as a precursor to this in a way not really a precursor but this is a special event which happens only once   only once  that is we don t repeat this  this will happen in december  till now  we have done three special events like this  where they are production quality  entire ashram is done up for this purpose  not like other programs  which are repeated  this is only onetime programs  we did vaibhav shiva  which was about how shiva taught yoga  then we did three years later  leela   this is about how krishna taught yoga  then about three years ago  we did mahabharat  which is the grandest story that you can imagine  it s a story inside a story inside a story  it s the most phenomenal story  it s the longest story on the planet  so  an eight day event happened like this  hundreds of hours of videos  they are still editing  not released after three years   so this year  in the month of december  between twenty second and twenty sixth  we will have an event  which is about the devotees of shiva   we have not there are different types of cultures  which have evolved out of devotion for shiva  they are in different geographical locations in the country  largely  and they have their own practices  they have their own traditions  cultures  their own flavor  their own poetry  their own music  so  this will be a an exquisite event of music  art  poetry and of course the spiritual fundamental  so this will be about the devotees of shiva  this will be a limited number of people  we can t have a crowd like this   but others can hang out later   okay  we will make it available to you in some way  so this will be a four  five day event in the month of december  starting on the winter solstice  which is twenty second of december twenty first of december  it s an event to look forward to because it s an onetime event  we will not repeat those events again  those of you who can afford to be there in terms of time and whatever else  please make sure you are there  i am excited   and the last question of this evening s sathsang comes from carmen dragomir  a journalist and writer from romania   she s not a gymnast      namaskaram sadhguru   namaskaram   on the occasion of the guru poornima  what is the best gift a seeker can give to his guru  can we actually give anything to our guru or unlike other relationship  is just a take and take relationship for a student   on the occasion of guru poornima  what is the best gift a seeker can give to his or her guru  can we actually give anything to our guru or unlike other relationships  it s just a take and take relationship for a student    now  if you really take and take  i would be eternally grateful to you   the problem is you take and throw  take and throw  take and throw   if you simply take  take and take  what more does a guru want   and about a gift that you can give me   i appreciate the emotion behind it  i truly appreciate the emotion behind it but i want you to understand this much  a gift means something that you can give away  if you can give it away  why would i need it   if you can give it away  obviously i don t need it  but you can in the name of guru  you can give it away to a child who needs it  you can  in the name of guru  you can give it away to some some other project or process or something that s happening  that s up to you  now  what one needs to understand is  if you re really serious about offering a gift to your guru  what you are saying in a little with a certain   what to say   with a certain disturbance within you  is this just about take and take  please just take and take  not take and throw  okay  if you take  take  take and take  that's the greatest thing you can do for me     thank you  now  on this guru poornima  in some way   if you want to really make a gift   in some way you offer something that is you  not some material that you can get rid of  give away the nastiest part of you today  to me  okay  i am not asking for the beautiful things that are there in you  i am not even asking for your love  i am asking  whatever is the nastiest part of you   your prejudice  your hatred  your anger   give it away to me today  let me see   because i want you to know  if you give away your anger to me  i know how   anger is tremendous energy you know  tch   i know how to transform anger into something very fantastic    so  if not the whole of you  at least one nasty part of you  please give it away today  let me see  hmm  can you   yes   yes   the beautiful things you can keep for yourself  the nastiest part of you  please give it away to me  let me see  don t give me your mother in law     sadhguru  please take    something that s a part of you  if you think you want to give something  because i am telling you  because many questions were asked in this direction  the greatest thing or the most important thing that needs to happen on this planet is an inward movement within human beings  this hugely empowered humanity  without the necessary inner balance  is a potential danger to everybody  to everything  to every other life  to every other creature  we are a danger  so  more and more people should commit themselves to turn the world inward  if you are already deeply entangled in life  at least send your children in that direction  something that is very precious to you  that s what you must give  isn't it  if you want to give  send your children in that direction  that they will strive to turn the world inward because this is the most important thing that needs to happen if human beings and every other creature on this planet has to live reasonably well on this planet  otherwise there is no other way  so  if you want to give something nasty  please give it away  i am welcome you are most welcome  if you want to give something beautiful  you must give yourself  your time  your life  if that s not possible  anyway the future generation  at least turn them in that direction  it s very important  this is for the well being of their future  it s very  very important that big number of people turn inward and they have a sense of balance  if this doesn t happen  you will see a very bad human society  which will rub and clash  the friction that happens is too much  so  on this day  on this very auspicious day  my best wishes and blessings for you to live as glorious human beings  thank you very much for hanging out with us
