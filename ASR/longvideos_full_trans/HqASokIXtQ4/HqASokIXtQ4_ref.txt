 in today s event three of our students will be in conversation with sadhguru on the theme of youth and truth  this is the first event in this series in which sadhguru will be in conversation with students on the theme of youth and truth  i now request ishan  saksham and om prakash to come on the stage   ishan is a final year dual degree computer science student  saksham is a third year engineering physics student and om prakash is a final year m tech mechanical engineering student   now i hand it over to sadhguru and the students to begin the conversation   namaskaram to everyone   good evening  everyone  first of all i would like to extend a very warm welcome to sadhguru to iit  it s a very rare occasion for us as a institute to have you here  so before we begin the conversation i would just like to put it in context  so when we got to know about sadhguru coming to iit we were thinking of how would it be appropriate to be able to represent of the thoughts of the community in the limited time by limited number of people so we thought of the idea of crowd sourcing the questions so we crowd sourced the question to everyone and people responded with a lot of questions and we had a hard time compiling them  so we prepared a cocktail of questions after crowd sourcing and we ve tried to represent all the different themes that are asked  so just beginning with the conversation i d like to start with a very silly and yet existential and fundamental question  so given that we are here on this planet for a limited life  given that we are human  we would not live forever  so what do you think is the wise way to spend the years on this planet    i know what can you hear me  i know what all the professors would like me to say   the wise is way is you must be focused on your academics  that s all the concern is but we must look at this  all life on this planet  anything that you take  a worm  an insect  a bird  an animal  a tree or a human being  the only thing that every life is aspiring for is it is trying to become a full fledged life  an earthworm is trying to be an full fledged earthworm  a grasshopper is trying to be a full fledged grasshopper  a mango tree is trying to be a full fledged mango tree  so is a human being  only thing is we know what is a full fledged earthworm  we know what is a full fledged grasshopper  we know what is a full fledged everything but we do not know what is a full fledged human being  doesn t matter what you do somehow seems inadequate  no matter where you get in your life you will see there is one more thing to do  never does a human being come to a place where he thinks this is it  that only other people say when you re dead  this is it   so the essential nature of life not just human life  every life is it is longing to become a full fledged life  so is a human being  so wherever you may be in your life right now you want to be something more  if that something more happens you want to be something more  if that happens something more  you will see whatever your aspirations right now as students suppose all of them get fulfilled within the next one year  you will immediately see you will have another aspiration  if everything that you want gets all fulfilled by tomorrow morning you will see you will have much more things to do because the very nature of being human is such you always want to be something more  but if you really look at it what you want is not something more  what you want is a limitless expansion  even if i make you the king of this planet don t look at me hopefully   i will not make such a blunder   but suppose we make you the king of this planet  do you believe you will be fulfilled  you will look at the stars  if you have this planet in your hands you will look at the stars  if i give you one galaxy you will look at the next galaxy   this is the nature of the human being  there is something within us which is always longing to become boundless  but in most human beings because of their fear of suffering they think that if they desire for something and it doesn t happen they will suffer  because of the fear of suffering this longing to become boundless is finding a very constipated expression  this constipated expression of longing for the boundless gets labeled as ambition  what you think is ambition is just a constipated expression for a boundless expansion that every life is longing for  but you will see in your life no matter what happens you will see you will want something more  this somebody may label it as greed  it is not about greed because the very nature of the human being is such no matter how many pacifists  philosophies you teach him you cannot contain him  people have told you  you must be happy with what you have  whatever god has given you that should be the right thing for you but it s not worked for one human being on this planet  it only works either when you re very sick or very old  otherwise if you have little energy coursing through your body you want to do something more  so it s not more  a human being there is something within you which doesn t like boundaries  if i imprison you in a five by five cubicle you will feel terribly imprisoned  then we will liberate you tomorrow into a ten by ten cubicle  you will feel wonderful for a day but again you will feel imprisoned  the next day we will release you into a hundred by hundred cubicle  you will feel really great but in three days again you ll want to break that boundary  it doesn t matter where i set the boundary  the moment you become conscious of the boundary you want to break that boundary  this is the nature of the human being  so there is something within you which does not like boundaries  so if you do not like boundaries what should you seek  that s a question  as long as you live in the physical nature of the existence the very nature of physicality is a defined boundary  only because there is a defined boundary physical is possible  we can call this a physical body because it has boundaries  if i pull out all the boundaries this will not be physical anymore  so somewhere unconsciously every human being is wanting to touch a dimension beyond physical nature  if you touch a dimension beyond the physical nature then we use the much maligned and corrupted word called spirituality  spiritual means not looking up or looking down  spiritual means your experience of life has transcended the limitations of being physical  something more than physical is happening to you  this means you are on the spiritual process  so this longing is there in every human being so essentially it doesn t  what you do in your life  our activity is not about us  activity is about the world that we live in  today you are here in twenty first century so you guys are in iit  suppose you were here 5000 years ago where would you be   in a jungle   hmm  no  no   you know  5000 years ago they were talking mahabharata  ramayan so you would be in one of those armies trying to shoot a arrow    hey  you can t shoot anything   you were trying to learn to fight with somebody in a sword or something else of the day  i m saying your mind  your application  your fulfillment in activity would be all that type of activity relevant to the times  our activity is always about the times in which we exist  it s not about us really  what times do we exist  what is most needed right now  that s what we do  but how to be is the question  if it comes to how to be there s only one way to be that somewhere in every human being there is a longing to expand beyond physical limitations  this is happening in four different ways  if it finds a very basic physical expression we call this sexuality  you are trying to expand the boundary of who you are  what you are not you are trying to include as yourself  this is what sexuality is  if it finds an emotional expression we call this love  once again something that is not you  you are trying to make it a part of you  if it finds a mental expression it gets labeled as ambition  greed  conquest or simply shopping   if it finds a conscious process then we call it yoga  yoga means not twisting your body or turning your body  yoga means union  in some way consciously you learn how to obliterate the boundaries of your individual nature  now your ability to experience yourself beyond your physical existence has become a living reality for you  this is everybody s longing but it finds constipated expression  instead of that if you find a conscious expression  life will be very  very different   so you said that it s a very continuous journey of expansion and like having this conscious expression would make it very different but this is very easier said than done  so like doing it is a journey all together  so if i m on this journey so i d have personal aspirations  i d have spiritual aspirations but there s also a conflict with the societal life that i live in  there are responsibilities on me from my family  there are some social boundations that i have while trying to be limitless  so how do i cope with this conflict  or in fact i d like to ask that is it even possible that we are able to draw a synthesis between the two   you are talking like a much married man   this is usually a diplomatic way of saying i m married   see  we need to understand this  though everybody is thinking they are shaping their own lives and whatever  the human longing to expand is not your doing  this is the nature of life itself  it s not something that i aspire for a spiritual process  there s no such thing  every human being is longing for expansion  will they long for it consciously or unconsciously that s all the choice is  anyway every human being is longing for expansion  even the beggar on the street is looking for little expansion of his territory  isn t it  yes or no  so wanting to expand is not your doing or my doing  this is the nature of life  it s invested in us  now what we are doing in the world today is just a question of the times in which we exist  okay  we have little choices  whether you want to do art  music or engineering or medicine or something like this but essentially all this activities are supposed to be for human well being  isn t it  so fundamentally there s only one business of human well being  the question is what is your competence  what is the nature of your  you know  intelligence so that how you could be most useful so you will choose that  this does not determine  you doing an engineering program or a medical program or an art program should not decide the nature of who you are  that only decides the nature of your activity  not the nature of who you are   so continuing with this what is the role of a guru in a person s journey   how do we students or as people over here  how do we find a guru and how do we know that  that person is actually a guru is actually leading us to the correct path   if he confuses the hell out of you and you still like him  he s your guru   if somebody is trying to help you to find certainty in an uncertain world he is not your guru  he is trying to sing a lullaby to you  you understand  the nature of life is such that every moment it is changing and evolving into something else but somebody tries to create certainty  don t worry  god will take care of you  god is holding your hand  everything will be fine  everything will be fine  they ve been saying this for a long time but life has buggered people very badly in so many ways  yes so this is not about inventing a psychological certainty and getting completely delinked from the reality of the existence  the nature of the existence is such nothing can be stagnant here  it is only the dynamic nature from atomic to cosmic that is keeping the existence going including the human being and every other life  so a guru is not somebody who ll give you solace  he is a solution because the only reason why you may need him is because it s an unfamiliar terrain  see  every year i trek in the himalayas  indian part or generally now in nepal and tibet  there this sherpa guy who leads me on  well  your lungs will be in your mouth  you are at eighteen thousand feet and your lungs is in your mouth and you re determined  you re going step by step  they re two roads  this looks nice and easy  this guy says   he won t say  sadhguru ji  please  this is the way   no     he s carrying my bags and he s illiterate but he says  like this  without argument i follow  though this looks better to me i just follow because i know he knows the terrain better than me  i know the mountains very well but still i know he knows it better than me  once i recognize that it is sensible to follow him  if you do your own thing you won t last  the same thing goes with the inner terrain  when you go into a terrain that s unfamiliar to you  it s best to go with somebody who s already walked the terrain otherwise to find your neighborhood you may round the planet and come back  that is also one way but it s a brief life    so i want to bring to a different theme  why you  why are you copying questions    i just wanted to  i ve seen people copying answers but    as students a lot of us especially in institute like iit we did a survey and we found that a lot of students are under stress and we re used to a reward and punishment mechanism  so till the time there s no sword hanging on us  till the time there s no deadline  we ll procrastinate and we ll wait for things to happen and that s when we do  and when we talked to students they say that  this is the way we know how to work  this is the way we are trained  and related this many of them say that fear of failure sometimes motivates them  and they say that this is essential and this is how things have to happen  is that so that this is only way we can work or because it sometimes makes us feel very restricted  is there a way where we can be free of this   see  let s understand this in a more fundamental way  see  when we say stress  when we say anxiety  when we say depression  when we say misery or when we say joy  when we say bliss  when we say ecstasy or love or whatever  all human experience comes from within you  is this so  all of you  i m asking for a higher opinion    is this so   yes   all human experience happens from within you  at least what happens from within you must happen the way you want it  yes or no  now you are still in a university  once you step out into the larger world  tch  this is a very protected world that you re living in  if this you re thinking sword is hanging on your head you ll have a bomb ticking  once you step out  this is a very comfortable life  very protected life  here nothing is hanging on you  okay  yes  you need to pass your examinations  whatever  there are some challenges i m not saying no  but all human experience happens from within  whatever comes from within you can i assume that you are doing it  if something sweet comes out of you right now can i assume you are saying something sweet  something nasty comes out of you can i assume you re saying it   yes   or is it your ego    i think the ego then   because this has become the way of the world  people have found all kinds of fall guys   spiritual fall guys and civil fall guys  if they do something wonderful they say it s me  if they do something nasty they say it s that mr  ego  that guy does this  if they do something wonderful in the world they say it s me  something go  little goes wrong in their life they ll find one little guy here and say it s because of him  if something big goes wrong in their life they ll find one big guy there and say it s because of him   this  guy is missing  this guy needs to come into the play  only when this guy comes into play you call that life  yes  when this guy play this is called life  if that guy plays i don t know what it means  this guy plays  this is rubbish  everything that goes on in my life somebody who can t stand up to me he s responsible  something big goes wrong in my life  he s responsible  this one is missing  one who is missing how can he experience life  how can he create life  how can he know life  so this guy has to come into play  so one important thing that needs to happen in the world today is we have to move from religion to responsibility applause we have been slinking around with life  when things happen i m there when it don t happen  somewhere  somewhere  no  if you understand it s me who is causing anxiety to myself not my examination  when i joined the institution i know there are going to be examinations  isn t it  what is causing anxiety is not something else  my inability to handle my own thought and my emotion  isn t it  if it so happened your left hand is free right now  your left hand is free  suppose it pops up and punches you in the face  what will you do    i will ask him to restrain the left hand   if it doesn t work we ll ask them to tie it up  if it doesn t work at all  if it s going to pull out your eyeballs then we may have to amputate it  yes or no  right now that is all you re trying to do  to beat the anxiety you ll drown yourself in alcohol  to beat the anxiety you burn yourself down with smoke  what you re trying to do is amputate yourself because you don t know how to handle the potential of being human  your problem is very evolutionary  when i say evolutionary  see  do you know   i mean you re all engineering students so i m asking do you know do you know the dna difference between you and a chimpanzee is only 1 23 percent  1 23 percent is not much of a difference  isn t it   yes or no  physiologically that is how close to a chimpanzee you are  but in terms of your intelligence  intellect and awareness you are worlds apart from a chimpanzee  or in other words your intellect or this cerebral activities in evolutionary scale it s of recent origin  it s new  you ve still not learned how to deal with it  you have an intelligence for which you don t have a stable enough base  the only and only reason you suffer either misery or anxiety or depression or whatever   this may sound very cruel to you but the reality is this  that your own intelligence has turned against you  it is like you ve been given a sharp knife  you don t know how to handle it  every day you keep cutting yourself and you think there is something wrong with the knife  no  you don t have steady hand  if your intelligence worked for you one hundred percent would you create blissfulness or misery for yourself  joy or misery please chose right now i m going to bless you    joy   for yourself you clearly know highest level of pleasantness is what you want  what you want for your neighbor is debatable  what you want for yourself is very  very clear  isn t it  so you create ghosts of you own and try to fight them  can i tell you a joke  you okay   no  because you re from delhi i m asking you   an indian man probably from an iit  went to united states of course as a technology person to start with  then he started dabbling with some investments  then he started playing the stock market  in 1996 i think  four or six i m not sure  in one of those years he had a windfall in the american stock market  that year he earned the highest amount of money on the us stock market which is not a small amount  it s a huge sum  he was already over sixty years of age  just the previous year he was divorced   timely divorced it happened because in california law you have to share fifty percent with the wife  just one year ahead of this windfall the wife had left him   and he wanted to spend this money upon himself so he bought himself a 1932 ferrari for thirty six million dollars  he bought a beverly hills home for eighty million dollars  then he was over sixty  he wants to live long so he thought he needs a medical checkup  in northern california there are medical institutions which are swankier than seven star hotels and you can go there  not some dreary medical checkup  in one day  everything  fifteen days you can get admitted for a fortnight and you can choose your tests unlike you  you can t choose your tests   you can choose your tests  all kinds of esoteric tests are there  you can choose what kind of tests you want to go through  so the entire space was nice  the appointed a very pretty looking young woman to take care of him  he was enjoying the entire process  on the fourth day he was feeling very relaxed in the evening and he was lying on his bed  unfortunately what should happen in the toilet happened upon the bed  he felt very embarrassed and he did not know how to handle this mess  not knowing how to hand this mess he was just looking how to do this  just then he heard this young woman coming towards the room  in america fortunately young ladies don t cannot walk quietly  they walk tok  tok  tok  tok   so when he heard this tok  tok  tok  she knows  he knows she is coming  he does not want this young lady to see the mess on the bed  so he just gathered all the hospital white sheets and threw it out of the fifth floor window  down below a regular man was going home from a party   and it s such an unfair world  because a man is expected to walk on a round planet and the damn thing is spinning all the time  this you realize only when you have had a few m  few drops too many or few drops between your ears are gone   so he was walking sideways and slowly finding his way home  then these sheets came and covered him   then he screamed and yelled and fought with these sheets  it took him over two minutes to get the sheets down  then the sheets got down and he was looking at the sheets dazed  the security arrived hearing all this commotion  they said   what is all the commotion about  the man said it looks like i ve beaten the shit out of a ghost    so it s your thought  what happens in your mind is your thought  isn t it  it s your emotion unfortunately  unfortunately our education systems from an early age have not thought you this much  how to handle your thought  how to handle your emotion  tch  if you did not know how to handle your hands it would be a mess  isn t it  this you will know if you come to tamil nadu  you will suddenly realize tamil people can use their fingers far better than you  that is  on a banana leaf they will put rice and rasam  you will see it ll go all over the place  but they won t let a drop go anywhere  in two minutes it ll be dry just with their fingers   so everybody can get to use what they have much better than the way they re handling it right now  isn t it  if you knew how to handle your thought and emotion would you think anxiety is a problem  would you think stress is a problem  tension is a problem  would you think such things would exist for you  so essentially it is our inability to handle our own thought process  our own emotions that all this is happening  instead of learning to handle it we are giving labels to all our inabilities  all kinds of exotic titles for ourselves  no  this is not the way to go about it  i am telling you this is the easiest part of your life  being in a protected institution like this  getting the best of academics and you just have to pass an examination  that s all  once you step out it s another game    you said that this is the easiest part of your life as a student but we see that a lot of youngsters fall into the clutches of stress  depression and to cope with that they go to the addictions like alcohol  drug  porn  internet etcetera and they think that it will give them relief   i didn t know internet was along with the drugs    so how to deal with them   look at me  i m always stoned   never been on a substance but you must understand whatever stimulants whatever stimulus you may take from outside essentially human experience of all kinds is caused only from within  the question is only are you on push start or are you on self start  which is better technologically   self start   self start  so if i teach you  suppose i teach you that you can simple sit here and be totally blissed out  more stoned than anybody on the campus   at the same time you re fully aware  would you go for it  hmm  would you go for it  fully stoned  fully conscious  would you go for it   yes   see the only problem with your alcohol  drugs  everything is not a moral issue  it is a life issue because it destroys life  it s not a morality that this is good  this is bad  that s not the point  the point is it makes you incapable in so many ways  there was a certain israeli scientist who was researching on marijuana or cannabis  over eighteen years the us drug and  drug administration gave him large quantities of marijuana and he went on experimenting and eighteen years  time he came up with really nothing significant and during mid eighties when american agencies were fighting drug on the street  they changed their policy of fighting the suppliers in mexico and south america  they decided to fight on the street with the users  so they said somebody said this is not right  you re giving this man such a big stock  we don t know what he is doing because he had not produced anything  eighteen years of research  then he moved to israel  the israeli government looked at his work and they decided to give him big stocks of marijuana  and after another three and a half  four years he came up with this  he found that in the human brain there are millions of cannabis receptors  then he threw this question to various disciplines  anthropologist tried to look at it and say at some time in history maybe every human being was smoking that s why the receptors  then they said this is rubbish because in many parts of the world it was not there  even a eskimo has cannabis receptors where he has never seen anything like this  then various things happened then the neurologists came up with this  they said always the human brain is waiting for the cannabis  that which causes intoxication  not waiting for it from outside  it can generate from within that is why there are receptors  so this is something that we have always known  i can show you   i m there always but you look at my eyes  i m always stoned but as aware as anybody can be  if you do not know intoxication in life you will never know a sense of abandon  if you don t have a sense of abandon you will never walk full stride in your life  you will only walk half steps all the time  only when there is no fear of suffering because you re highly intoxicated and fully aware not because you consumed substances which will take away your awareness  simply because you re keeping the system  the human mechanism at its highest function  now it is fully self sufficient  blissed out all the time  now you will not think of all these things  i m i want you to look all young people  i want you to look at this  in your life would you like to do that which works or that which does not work  hmm   multiple answers  human intelligence is always looking for that which works  isn t it  that which does not work is not what we re interested in  that which works  when  i m  i m just wondering how far to take you  you look like a nice boy   this is it is just this  every experience  whatever happens to you   right now let s look at it this way  right now all of you  those who are in the upper regions also  do you see me   yes   even if you re not listening  do you see me    yes   if you see me can you use one of your hands and point out where i am  tch  tch  tch  you also  oh  you got it wrong  you know i m a mystic  from southern india   so today you know this light is falling upon me  reflecting  going through your lenses  inverted image in the retina  you know the entire story  isn t it  so you see me within yourself  you hear me within yourself  where have you seen the whole world  within yourself  the way it is projected in the firmament of your mind you are not seeing the world it is  you are saying it the way it s projected within you  a grasshopper may not be seeing the world the way you see it  he is seeing it differently  yes or no  same world but he sees  sees it differently because his visual apparatus are made completely different  you know that different animals hear  some hear subsonic sound  some hear ultrasonic sound  we  we don t hear both of them  yes  we hear something else  so we are all living in the same world but seeing and hearing things completely differently  what is day for us  what is light for us is darkness for some other creature  what is darkness for them is light for us  obviously our instruments of perception are created for our survival process and their instruments for survival are crafted for their survival process but now your intelligence has blossomed to a place where survival is not good enough  you want to know the nature of life  once this longing comes then you must understand the instruments of perception need to be in enhanced  these instruments five senses of seeing  hearing  smelling  tasting and touching  they are not good enough because they are only instruments of survival  they are not instruments of true knowing because they show you everything in comparison  when i say everything in comparison  right now if you re six feet tall  you stand like a tall man  you walk like a tall man  you think like a tall man  you are a tall man  you went to another society where everybody is eight feet tall  suddenly you stand like a short man  walk like a short man  think like a short man  you are a short man  isn t it   i m saying what you know in comparison is only good for survival process not to know the nature of life  so right now everything that you know is only by comparison  if i touch this i feel it s cool  no  that s not the reality  the reality is because my body temperature is in a certain way i make a judgment that this is cool  suppose i lower my body temperature substantially and then i touch this  this would be warm to me  yes or no  so what you re perceiving is only by comparison  what you know by comparison is just a distortion of reality  it is good enough for survival  it is not good enough to know the nature of life  now you re talking about stress and anxiety as i said every year we ve been trekking in himalayas  two years ago i m in a tent somewhere in nepal and i m doing some work  someone else is cutting an apple   there s another person in the tent  that person tells this person   be careful  it s a very sharp knife  it irritates me because i call something a knife only if it s sharp  what about you   i call something as knife only if it s really sharp otherwise i will call it a screw driver   i look at this and then i continue my work  and another two minutes again it is said   be careful  it s a very sharp knife  i say  come on  leave the man alone  if it s a child yes  but this is full grown man  he knows how to handle a knife  not a complicated machinery   no  sadhguru  it s a very sharp knife    then i continued my work  another two minutes i hear a whisper   be careful  it s a very sharp knife    another two minutes he cuts his hand  then i give up   why i m saying this to you is knife is not a sharp instrument  a knife is not dangerous instrument  every day in the world both in terms of kitchens and operation theaters tell me are knifves saving more lives or taking more lives  saving more lives  in an irresponsible hand it may take somebody s life  knife is not dangerous  it is in whose hands it is  what kind of hand is it which makes it dangerous  knife is not a dangerous instrument  yes or no  only if an unsteady hand is handling  if a child holds a knife  we say  be careful  be careful because not because knife is dangerous because the hand is not steady  right now this is the situation  compared to every other creature on the planet your intellect is little sharper than them   would you like to have a sharp intellect or a dull one   sharp   sharp  if you want a sharp intellect you must learn to hold it right otherwise every day you start poking  this is self help   you know  when was the last time somebody stabbed you with a dagger in the  when was the last time somebody stabbed you with a dagger   even in delhi it doesn t happen   maybe somebody poked you with a pin at the most when you were in school  or maybe they ignored you  they did not even do that   so what i m saying is how much suffering is actually coming from outside  miniscule  isn t it  rest is all self help  so once your intelligence turns against you  believe me no force in the universe can save you  so it s very important before you do anything else in your life you learn to bring your body and mind to a state where your body take instructions from you  your mind takes instructions from you  they must serve you  you should not be serving them  otherwise you will live a very poor life  very poor life because you can only live a life of some significance only when your mind and your body works for you not against you  isn t it  at least this much every human being should take charge of   sadhguru  i speak to my friends around here and whenever we talk about meditation or yoga  they say   ah  that s for the old people  that s not for us and we re not very interested in it  and one of my friends said   i tried meditating and i slept  so why is it that meditation and yoga is perceived as something for the old and not for the young generation   we don t need this   maybe because that is the kind of people they have met  in the sense yoga means they saw all yogis who fell out of the calendars  printed in shiva kashi  you know  in south india   all right  they thought yoga means you re not interested in life  that s a general thing  i am doing everything possible to change this perception  many things  this is not for anything because you re young people i m saying  something physical you learn  let s say you learn to ride a dirt bike  let s say you learn to do sky diving  let s say you learn to fly a helicopter  let s say you learn to ski  do something  what you may take three years or five years to learn i will do it in three months at this age  would you like to do that at an early age or when you re dying  i m asking you   early age   then you must do yoga    i will tell you i got into yoga for all the wrong reasons  but that is the beauty of life  even for wrong reasons if you do the right thing it works  i was just eleven  twelve years of age  every summer vacation we go to our grandfather s ancestral home where in the backyard there is a well which is about eight feet in diameter  about hundred and fifty feet in depth  water generally in summer will be at least sixty  seventy feet below the ground level  so one of the sport for us young boys is to jump into this well and climb up  when you jump you have to go properly otherwise your brains will become a smear on the wall  and to come up there is no step  there is no foothold  nothing  just holding the rock you have to climb  i remember just the sheer pressure  my weight i was not very heavy but still my weight on just two fingers and three fingers like this  my nails would bleed out of sheer pressure not injury just hanging onto the rock like that with claws  but i would do that and i m very proud that i m good at it  one day a man who is over seventy years age simply standing there silently watching us  we ignored him because seventy means for us he was dead   not now  okay   perspective of life will change  you know   at that time seventy means he s gone  but without a word this man who was over seventy two years of age at that time  he just walked to the well and jumped  i thought he s finished  but he came up faster than me  i didn t like it  then i asked  how  he said   come  do yoga  like a puppy i went behind him   because i found him so super human that he could do things that no young man could do  so i got into yoga for all the wrong reasons  see it doesn t matter how you get in  which door you enter from it doesn t matter as long as you do the right thing it works  essentially what yoga means is this you use a cell phone  what  samsung  iphone   yes  a samsung    tch  you didn t use the seven   so if you have a cellphone is it true or any gadget  the more you know about it the better you can use it  is it so  yes or no  that s what your entire engineering is about  to know more about everything so that you can use it better  make it better  isn t it  why is that not true with this  the more you know about this  the better you can use it  anyway of all the gadgets that you find on this planet is this  the most sophisticated mechanism on the planet  do you agree with me  if you don t agree with me then something wrong with you   this is the most sophisticated mechanism on the planet  isn t it  why is it that you have not paid attention as to see what are all the intricacies of what this is  what this means is you haven t read the user s manual but you want to blunder into the world  so just education is becoming stress  if you want to create something in the world you will see so many more challenges  so education which is a simplest process of all  that is becoming stress  this is simply because you have not read the user s manual at all  simply   samsung  we don t know what ll happen  you must learn how to use it  similarly this   so if you know perfectly well how to use this then we say you re self realized  self realized does not mean you went to heaven  you know this  perfectly well  you know everything  the range of things this can do  this is all i know in my life  i know this piece of life from its origin to its ultimate  people think i know everything  that s their problem  i know only this    so  there s a lot of talk about our country  india these days  even in the world platforms we see that the things are improving  but going to the past of the india if we see the history of world s civilizations we see that india particularly stands out very clearly when it comes to developing ways of this self experiential ways of realizing this inner truth about ourselves or knowing the body and the higher truths through self experiential ways  so what do you think was it that we were able to do properly that we were able to discover these things and not just that  we were not just able to discover but also proliferate them into the social eco system  what was it that led us into this   essentially a long spell of peaceful  civilized life   a long spell  you must understand this  the reason why we got this long spell is in the north we were protected by the himalayan ranges  in the south by the indian ocean  so this is himalaya  the indian ocean that we call today as the india ocean at that time it was called as the indu sagara  this is why we took the identity  hi  and  du  hindu  hindu is not a religion  not belief system  not a god oriented thing  it is a geographical identity  unfortunately it s turned into many things today that s a different thing  so we identified with these two geographical features because we realized it s only because of these features that we had an undisturbed civilization growing without any external agencies coming and disturbing us  when there is a long spell for a human being where he doesn t have to fight for his survival on a daily basis  that is when human genius flowers   in many ways human genius flowered  we produced the greatest mathematician  greatest astronomers  greatest musicians  all kinds of people and many technologies which we refused to use simply because we foresaw if you go this way what will happen to the world  various other things  if you look back at the glorious history of this country it is simply because   which is true even today  see you can build a great society or a great nation or a great world not by talking about it  only by building individual human beings who are truly great  without great human beings where is a great society  society is just a word  nation is just a word  world is just a world  individual human beings are the only reality  what kind of people we are that s the kind of india we have  isn t it   so the focus right from ancient times in this country was always about individual development  we never see this is why the western commentators are missing the entire point  they don t  they think india never had a civilization because we never spoke about it  we refused to speak about society  about nation  we only spoke about individual development because if you generate great individuals  we will naturally have a great society  a great society is a consequence  it is not the cause  the cause is great individuals  so our focus was always on producing great human beings never on producing a great society or a nation  that happened as a consequence    so do you think from ancient times till now do you think that things in india have changed  so if they have what brought us to the change we are in and how do you see this development process of great individuals  how do you see that being manifested in the modern times   and if i may add how can these ideas   it s something that i m assuming that they are not so prevalent in  i m sorry  not   i m assuming that these ideas of individual development focused on an individual are not so prevalent in today s system  no  we ve gotten into mass production of everything    yes  so how we actually bring them back and how should india then   if i ask a larger question   how should india as model of development  is it just aping the west or can we bring back those elements of individual development   see  for anything to happen you need a certain ecosystem  certain economic  what to say  a certain economic depth to  for people to be able to do it  you must understand this  the generation that we were growing up  our parents were just crazy that you must somehow get one degree and get into a government job  your parents are not doing that  they are thinking little more easy  they are trying to explore things  they want you to do a startup  they want you to do a business  they want you to get into sport  this was never there  they were just saying get a job somehow otherwise you ll be on the street  this was the level of economics of the time  today there is a little more economic space where parents are looking at their children little differently  still we are little compressed in the heads but little more ease than what it was forty  fifty years ago  ask all your professors  they were just pushed  pushed  get a job  get a job first thing  today your parents are not looking like that  looking at what can you create  what can i  our children can create  what can they live  how about their happiness   nobody ever thought about our happiness  okay   so it needs a certain economic depth for any society to experiment  to have little more freedom to do things otherwise putting them through the extruder and getting them out in some form in which they re useful  this is what the society will do  this is a natural consequence of fifteen  twenty generations of extreme poverty  this is this mental structure and this economic structure is a consequence of fifteen to twenty generations of extreme poverty  very bad poverty means india has suffered poverty like nobody else  people may show  you know  pictures of africa and stuff  you must know this  in africa there have been famines  there have been wars  unnecessary wars and tribal wars which have caused this in small scale  in india the level of malnourishment and poverty that s happened in the last two centuries is most painful  no other nation on the planet has suffered as much as this country  no other country has lost as many people as we have lost in the last century just for hunger and lack of nourishment  even today it is true though we are much better  even today unfortunately it is true that we have the highest number of malnourished people in the country  more than sixty percent of the rural population even today  they have not grown their skeletal system has not grown to full size  when they are in that state you re only thinking how to make a living  you re not thinking of how to open up human genius  you re not interested in all that  you re not thinking how to become self realized  you re only thinking how to make a living  so this has happened to us because we ve been an occupied nation for too long  we ve been ripped off in every other way  there s no point blaming somebody  we didn t take care of it at that time  it went out of our hands but two hundred fifty  three hundred years ago everybody wanted to come to india  why  because it was the richest country on the planet  we occupied a thirty three percent space in the economic space of the planet at one time  today probably we are two or three percent  hmm  so because of this extreme poverty we have a certain mindset but i think in a generation or in next fifteen  twenty years a whole lot of people will come out of this because there s little more ease  little more space to play with  little more space to push it  so as a part of this we are creating this space in many ways  we have three types of education  you know in isha  we have what s called as isha vidya which is in rural india which includes our own schools which are mainly focused towards teaching english language  computer sciences  regular academic education at a certain level  bring discipline and well being  health and well being  nourishment which is most important in the villages and get them out of the village because to get out of that economic and social pit in which they are education is just a passport for them  that s one level of education  another level of education we have what s called as isha home school  this is for the little more affluent people  this happens inside the yoga center itself  we have a huge track of land and various facilities  these schools are run in a certain way  twenty children live with two dedicated house parents and everything  the school itself is inside the house  that s why it s called a home school  only for playground  laboratory and libraries they go out  everything is inside the house  this turns out expensive an expensive way of delivering education but this is done by dedicated people  as a rule we never take any trained teachers  we have doctors  engineers  accountants  all kinds of people but no trained teachers because we want education to happen as an inspiration not as putting  you know  shoving down information down somebody s throat  as an inspiration children should get the spark of wanting to know something  there is a whole range of activity of theatre  art  music  sport  all kinds of things  many of our  i mean two  three of our boys are now in professional football in germany  so like this they are going into various things  this school gives an enormous range of things  and i made this now  eleventh  twelfth i made it three years  not two years  three years i said one year extra because by the time they got get to eleventh a whole lot of parents will get marks mad  we have invested so much time in music  theatre and many  many things  now eleventh standard comes and everything is dropped and they just start doing only  trying to get marks  so i said three years  if you want you stay otherwise no  the surprising thing is nobody wants to withdraw their children  this wouldn t have happened twenty five years ago  everybody would have withdrawn their children  now nobody wants to be  not even one child wants to be withdrawn  everybody wants to go three years for two years  just as an experiment i announced this   everybody is taking to it  the idea is  see  indians  wherever i go  what i see is  they are in the best jobs  they're earning well  they're highly qualified  but they can't sing  they can't dance  they can't paint  they can't do any damn thing except going to work  really  this' an unfortunate thing   there's no life   so  i thought we must invest enough in the children before they get into professional colleges  we have to invest enough in their art  music  sport  variety of interests  they must explore many things  there's another school which we call as isha samskriti  here  if any child enters compulsory they must stay with us  as a commitment  for twelve years  only with that commitment we take the children  here there's no academics  they learn only yoga  kalaripayattu  which is the mother of all martial arts  have you seen kalaripayattu  kerala       yes  kalaripayattu  classical dance  classical music  samskrit language and english language  this is all they learn  you must see these children  you won't believe  they are a different set of human beings all together  here  the focus is just this   developing human body and human brain to its fullest without a purpose  i'm doing this because this is how i grew up  i grew up without a purpose  my father beat his head and say   what will this boy do  he's not getting qualified for anything  so i would say   if i am not qualified for anything  i can do just about everything    so   these children are growing up in such a way  most amazing  you won't believe it unless you see it  i'm  just to tell you an experience  from age of six to eighteen they are with us  after that  if they wish  they can stay  otherwise  they can go out and do what they want to do  there are many things that they can do which we are supporting them to do  from fifteen to eighteen they become monks for three years   extreme discipline and focus  very serious practices  so before i initiate this  compulsory they have to come out at eighteen  we  they cannot choose to be monks  they have to come out at eighteen because this we have allowed  we have made them go into it as children  when they become adults  they must come out of it  there is  they cannot choose to continue  so  first batch i wanted to initiate  now another is coming now in july  the third one  the first batch  when i went to initiate about three years ago   sixty days  fifteen year old children  they have been on sixty days of silence  30 in the evening  they are in some kind of yogic sadhana  minimum of eight hours they're keeping their eyes closed and sitting  okay  just another four days are left for the initiation  i want to see how these boys and girls are doing   fourteen of them in the first batch  30  i went and sat in the room  these eight boys and six girls were sitting there   i'll never forget this in my life   they were just sitting there like that  believe me  they were literally glowing  i sat there and wept because i've never seen children like this in my life  i was not like this when i was fifteen  for sure  they are beyond anything that you can think of simply because they are focused in developing the human mechanism to its fullest  not about how to earn my living  this' not the question  when a earthworm  with one millionth of your brain can earn a living  with such a big brain  earning a living  is it such a big problem  it is the most it's the grossest way to approach life is   how will i earn my living  everybody can earn their living  the only problem comes in your life when you want to live like somebody else  that's a problem  but earning a living is not a problem  if you just make what is considered survival minimal  don't go on exaggerating it  then you will see you have a whole lot of time and opportunity to create what you want in your life  but people keep on raising the bar of survival so much that they will not get to do anything in their life except surviving  in the end  they don't know why they survived    so i think there's a lot of curiosity in the audience also building up  so unless you have some general comments to make  we can open the floor to the audience   tch  you're all engineers oh  they're disarming you   we must understand this   engineering means  essentially  to make things happen the way we want it  that's engineering  isn't it  to engineer this building means what  we want it the way we want it  we could have sat under a tree  but we choose to build this building because we want to sit under something engineered the way we want it  as suitable for us  we air conditioned the place because we want the temperature in a certain way  all this we did  but it is not important that you engineer this  the way you want it  hello   yes   outside is air conditioned  inside is boiling   what's the point   i'm saying power is being wasted on you   in the last hundred  hundred and fifty years with the advent of science and technology  we have more comforts and conveniences than any generation ever could imagine  isn't it  yes or no   yes   i'm looking for a higher opinion again   you have more comforts and conveniences than any generation could ever imagine  we are the most comfortable generation ever  physically  materially  but can you say are you the most peaceful generation  joyful  loving  no  or can you even say you're the most intelligent generation  that'll be a wrong thing to say  anybody who claims he is intelligent amounts to foolishness  isn't it  because the significance of intelligence is  it shows you how many loopholes are there in your intelligence  only a fool thinks there are no loopholes  a truly intelligent person always sees how many loopholes in my intelligence  the significance of being in a technological institute is not about just getting qualified to get some job somewhere or a passport out of the country  it should become a way of creating life  making life happen better than the way it's happening right now because this is the fundamental responsibility that we have as a generation of people because we occupy this space on the planet for a short  brief time  when the last generation gave this planet to us  whichever way they gave it  it's our business that when we leave it  we leave it little better than the way we had it   very important  how better  in what way better  you can decide that  i won't say only ecologically better  but in every way better  it must be better than the way we got it  this means we have to engineer ourselves to fit in such a way see  a well engineered machine means least amount of friction  isn't it so  yes  a well engineered machine means what  least amount of friction  heavy friction means badly engineered  isn't it  isn't that the understanding  so the fundamentals of yoga is this   the fundamentals of yoga is in the geometry of physical existence  if you understand the geometry of what this human mechanism is  the body is  the psychological structure is  the chemical processes are  the energy structures are  if you understand the geometry of this  and become capable of observing the cosmic geometry  if these two things are well aligned  suddenly your life hits off like a magic  your life is no more a miserable drag  but it's magical simply because you have gotten the right geometry of things  anything that is geometrically perfect will function absolutely smoothly and for a very long time  this is something that you must do to yourself when you're young  it doesn t matter what you want to do in your life  one thing must happen   your body and your brain should not come in your way  they must work for you  yes or no  hello   yes   never your body and your mind should not come in the way of who you want to be  right now  for most people  they themselves are a big issue  when you are a issue  how will you address the issues in the world  if you really want to address the issues in the world  this one  should never be a issue  isn't it   i am not the issue here  i am never the problem  if there are problems  i will deal with it  but i am never the problem    this must happen to you  isn't it  please make yourself like this  that you are never the problem  you're always a part of the solution  never a part of the problem  right now  right now we have developed a certain attitude in the country  a whole lot of people  for every solution they invent a problem   for every solution they have found a problem  so there are people who are working for problems  there are people who are working for solutions  young people should stand up and become a solution for future generations to come and your own life to blossom  because the greatest fulfillment in one's life is that you functioned in such a way that you could do something which is much larger than yourself  this must happen  this is the highest fulfillment of activity   that you are able to do something which is larger than yourself  only then  you will see fulfilment in activity  activity is one thing  but most important thing is how you are  people come to me right right now you're all saying you're iit is the problem  so i'm inviting you to iyc   it's isha yoga center   lot of people come to me and say   sadhguru  these  these are people who have passed out  okay   sadhguru  my mother in law   she's she's another   you know  form somewhere else she is   i just don't know how to live with this person  and my husband  after all  her son   my wife  impossible  my boss  he's not even human    like this it goes  then i tell them   see  don't worry   your husband  wife  mother in law  boss  nobody will come here  you're protected  tch   like iit  iyc also well protected  nobody will come here  you just come and stay  i'll give you a nice place to say   food is good  you don't have to do anything  just be joyful  that's all  none of these tormenters are there  just be joyful  twenty four hours you leave them in the  one room  you must see in how many ways they twist themselves out  when you're alone  if you're miserable  you're obviously in bad company  isn't it  so  all the young people should do this to yourself  at least for three days  one week  i will provide you the atmosphere  otherwise  you can walk into the himalayas   but there  there is no food and supply  you know  you will have to go searching  i will provide you food  everything  just come  spend some time  not with any purpose  simply  if you sit along for three days   no television  no book  no texting  simply by yourself  let's see what happens  you must know the nature of who you are  you should not go on dodging yourself and one day you will explode into something  you must know what is the level of madness you're suffering  when i say madness   if your mind is out of your control  is that called madness in definition  hello   yes   if your mind does not take instructions from you  it's out of control  is that called madness   yes   just try  just today  after this event  just go sit quietly in your room   just see what all your mind does  you  you decide  don't tell anybody   you decide what is the level of madness you're going through  with this  if you enter the world  what will you create  you will only create who you are  isn't it  you cannot do anything other than what you are  what you are is what will happen to the world around you  before you step out into the world  is it not important  at least you're this much equipped   that you are not the problem  if you meet a problem and get married  we'll see   but you are not the problem   can you make this happen for yourself  as young people   that you are never the problem  hmm  you are not the issue in your life  other issues  if they come  we will deal with it to the best of our ability  but this  should not be a issue  isn't it  this can be easily done   very simple processes  if you invest one twenty   thirty minutes a day  you can bring this possibility into your life  it is just that it needs a certain orientation because life is continuously outward  to turn inward it needs a certain help and situation has to be created to make that happen  we are very much willing to do that with you  it's my wish and my blessing this must happen to every youth of this country because india  the people of india has suffered immensely  i don't know to what extent all of you were exposed  many of you are from good families  i have walked through rural societies right from my  you know  early youth  it's not good  believe me  it's just not good  it's not some idyllic situation out there  it is bad  it's very bad  in most parts of the world  where we are they say they are the better off states  the better off states are like that  i know the bimarus  how they are  we can't just live like this  we can't just continue to live like this   insulating our humanity and thinking everything is okay  it's time we we have a living humanity  that our heart beats for everything  our heart bleeds for everything  and we will do the best we can do  in our lives  if we do not do what we cannot do  there's no problem  but if we do not do what we can do  we are a disastrous life  isn't it  it's my wish and my blessing you should not be that disaster    all right  so we'll now begin with the audience q and a  anyone who has a question can raise his hand and we have students here who'll get the mike to you   namaskaram sadhguru   where are you   okay   sadhguru  little closer  if you can    so what    dissolve    to you  all       all suffering to me    dissolve into you   ooh   i have read it in your book  so how can    dissolve ourselves into you   i am not sulfuric acid   let's understand this   what is dissolution  i don't know how you got this  that is not what has been said anywhere  but  little off  but let me correct that  see  whether people are conscious of it or not conscious of it  every human being  knowingly or unknowingly  are seeking solutions to wherever they are  isn't it so  or in other words  the nature of human intelligence is such that wherever you are  there is a problem   yes  this happened you  it's okay if i tell you a joke  hmm  i know it's a serious question  very spiritual   a husband and wife who were over seventy years of age  were celebrating their forty fifth wedding anniversary  tch  so they decided they will go through everything just the way it happened on the wedding day  so  wedding got over  they went to the church where they got married  they came out of it at the same time  then  as they did on that day  they went to a romantic italian movie  then after that  they went for a dinner in a particular restaurant  they had the same kind of food and the same kind of wine and they started driving  then the wife said   john  what's happened with you  do you remember forty five years ago when we were driving  how passionately you kissed me  so he said   okay    hey  don t laugh  you don't know what is forty five years later   that's a different world  okay   so  he tried to kiss her and unfortunately forty five years later your body is not the same and the cars are faster  and boom they went into the bridge  so  they were at the gates of heaven   then they got checked in together   and because both of them were golfers  they asked   is there a golf course in heaven  saint peter said   yes  the best  the best golf course you would have ever seen   so  can we see  he said  fine  they saw it was an immaculate course  they asked   can we tee off  is there a tee time  anytime is tee time in heaven  day or night  so  but we don't have our clubs   no problem  just for you  fitted for you  golden clubs  so  the man teed off  splitting the fairway  straight and long  tch  the lady walked up to the lady  lady's tee and teed off  again  straight  then they were walking towards the ball for the second shot  suddenly the husband became depressed  as it usually  many times happens to the husbands   she looked at him and said   john  what's the problem  we are in heaven  we are on the best golf course  you had a great shot  i had a great shot  why are you so depressed  he said   if it was not for your stupid health food  we could have come here long time ago    so  this is the nature of human intellect   because it gets only one face of everything  it is always thinking some everything is a problem  when you don't have a problem  you're dissolved  please see this  because you are not a problem  you're a possibility   when people most people most people  when they utter the word human  they say   oh  i am only a human  they're always referring to the word human as a limitation  as a problem  very few people are saying   i am human  referring to the immensity of being human because most people have not explored the immensity of what it means to be human  this is why there is so much talk about heaven and god and so many things   because people have failed to explore the immensity of what it means to be human  if you explore the full depth and dimension of what it means to be human  then you don't worry about dissolution because is it true is it true that you were not born this way  of this size  as you are today  hello   yes   slowly you accumulated  how  just the food that you've eaten  isn't it  what you accumulate can be yours  you cannot say it's me  isn't it  hello  as i'm speaking  i pick up this vessel and say   this is my vessel  then you will think   oh  sadhguru has some problem   but everybody says he's wise  let us listen some more  after some time i say   this is me  then you will say   let's go   because now it's dangerous  isn't it   but this you're doing every day   food appears on your plate  you say   this is my food  you eat it and then you say   this is me  you if you get this point today  that the body that you carry is just a piece of the planet   today if you get it experientially  your life will chance today  otherwise  one day you will anyway get it from the maggots  but it's a bit late  you know  so dissolution does not mean destruction  dissolution means you broke the boundaries of your individuality because your individual existence is a myth that you have created  you are very much individual  you don't like the person who is sitting next to you right now  so don't breathe the air that they are breathing  do one thing  just close your nose like this   hold it like this  for two minutes  you know that without communication you won't last for a moment  this is not just with respiration  this is with every particle in this body  without being in communication with the entire existence  this  cannot exist for a moment  so dissolution is not something that you have to do  if you drop the conclusions that you have made about yourself  this is already dissolved  modern physics is telling you this  isn't it  you already dissolved  you don't have to dissolve  it is just that you have a fancy idea in your head  to get that idea out is the spiritual process  spiritual process is not a real process  spiritual process is just helping you to distance yourself from your physiological and psychological process so that you see life just the way it is    sadhguru   where are you   here    okay   so  i completely resonate with the idea of yours which you have in education and having graduated from this place  and i don't know why i did engineering  one year of preparation  four years of b  tech  two years of m  tech  out of that frustration of why i'm doing engineering  i wanted to work in the education sector  and currently i am working  i feel i face many challenges  to bring about a change in the system of how things are working and how children are taught  it takes very it is a very slow process of how things move and how much you try that  okay  there should be a holistic development and this and that  things boil down to  okay  fall at feet and do this and do that though  i want to ask you  if you if you can give some tips on how your how you think of how education should be   can be actually scaled up  there are so many models which are there in some parts of the country which believe in this  and i too feel  kee   mediation can be introduced in the system of education  so  what do you feel kee   how can we make this happen at a large level   please   see  we are always thinking of changing the system  i am not saying it should not  it should  but within the existing systems we can do many things  depending upon the individual teachers and individual educators  how they operate  because when you try to change the system in your own time  when you want to change the system  you must understand any system  even within the family if you want to change a system  it will take many years  it's not going to change overnight  sometimes a generation has to pass as for it to change  to walk into a house with your shoes on  one generation has to pass   isn't it  so  instead of thinking how to change the system   yes  we must have the vision of changing the system  but within the system  how to do the maximum delivery is something that all of us should always look at  otherwise  we are always talking about future generations without addressing the current generations  it'll never work that way  it'll only be a dream  we have to make the difference in the current generation  only then  if you take a small step now  the next generation will take a bigger step  but without taking this step  we are dreaming of a big step  it will not happen  it will be just an idea which will not work  so  as an educator   you mentioned the word meditation  we must understand this  what meditation means  the word meditation  the english word meditation doesn't mean anything  if somebody sits with their eyes closed  people think they are meditating  but you can sit with your eyes closed for many reasons  unable to bear the world  you can close your eyes   yes  you may be in yoga there is many things   you may be doing japa  tapa  dharana  dhyana  samadhi  shoonya  samyama   we don't know what you're doing  so there is the word meditation is not specific  it is too general and it's not saying anything in particular  let us say if we are thinking to align the word meditation with what we refer to as dhyan  or dhyana  or dhayanam as you go south  because hindi speaking people  you have a way of clipping away the words in the end  hmm  we say rama  you say ram  we say dhyanam you said dhyan  tch  you're cutting off everything in the end  that's your option  but if you're thinking it is dhyan  or dhyana  or whatever  what this means is  if you sit here if you sit here  if you clear if you have a distinct experience that your body is here   you mind is somewhere else  what is you is elsewhere  or in other words  there is a little space between what is you and what is your body  what is you and what is the content of your mind  suppose this little space was achieved within you right now  would all these young boys be complaining about stress  you must do one thing   if you were an aviator you would know this   you're driving to the airport  traffic jam  traffic jam  traffic jam  ouhh  you curse everybody and honk and do all this and get there  then you fly  then you're flying over the traffic jam  it all looks very nice  you know   simply because of the distance   when you were in it  it was a terrible thing  once you're flying above it  it looks quite nice actually  traffic jams   once there is a little distance  that's the end of suffering  so if they if you create a little space between you and your body  between you and your mind  this is the end of suffering because there are only two kinds of sufferings in your life   physical suffering  mental suffering  do you know any other kind of suffering  hmm  only two sufferings  if you distance yourself a little bit  that's all  distancing is not by attitude  anyway these are accumulations  you gathered this body  you gathered this mind  if you keep what belongs to you one way  and what is you in another way  it's taken care of  so  we can teach you a simple method with which you can do this   very  very simple process  every human being is capable of this  let's understand this   when it comes to external realities  all of us are differently capable  no two human beings are equally capable  when it comes to inner possibilities  all of us are equally capable  no human being has come better endowed than the other  it is just that most human beings never look in that direction    namaste sadhguru  mein  i m here  my name is kamal  i m here with my wife  my mother and thank you so much for coming here  we have been following your guidance for many years now and it inspired us to  you mentioned about iyc  it inspired us to create yic or young india challenge where two days back we invited the youth of india from erode  bangalore  assam to solve india s challenges and i would like to ask you is that the way we re connecting this is that if people find their passion and do what they love  they should be able to positively contribute to the society and solve the biggest challenge  but we see that there are so many practical situations that young people face and today we re talking about youth and truth  how can we do this more and wake up more and more young people that not only they follow their passion but they must connect it to nation building and solving the biggest challenges of our time  especially the youth here which is as you said  privileged and has house  shelter and the basics are covered  how can we make it more experiential  that it becomes a movement that young people not only do what they love but also make a positive impact  how can we do this more and get a large number of young people to get into this conversation   you are the young man  i m willing to speak to any young people or old people  i  i don't see youth as a numerical entity  i think lot of young people are pretty old   complaining about stress   being young or old is not just of age  not the question of your birthday  when you were born  have you  are you an exuberant life or have you become   youth means life in the making  all possibilities wide open  that s what youth means  you ve not become conceited yet  you should not be  i m saying   you ve not made your conclusions about life  you re still willing to look at everything fresh  that s what youth means  i think it s the business of every human being to stay that way all their life that you never make your conclusions  you become a constant exploration and a seeking in life  that you ve not become a conclusion  conclusion should happen with death  before that if you conclude  then we will have to endure dead people walking around in the society who have no zest for anything but we have to bear with them   that should not happen to you or to anybody  isn t it  so  you said many things in one question  about nation building  about many things  yes  in seventy years we should have built the nation but we have made some grave mistakes for which we are paying the price but there s no point doing postmortem and going on thinking what we could have done right at that time  we should do the right things now and as a  as a nation  as a culture  i must tell you this  i speak to variety of people  to the highest level of academics  scientists  various parts of the world  but i still find  if you take a bunch of people  just like that if you catch them  one hundred people on the street in mumbai or bangalore or chennai  they re much smarter than anybody you can find anywhere  really  no  i  i didn t mean to leave out delhi   i m saying average intelligence in this country  average intellect in this country is naturally high because of a certain cultural ethos that we ve had for a long time  but our problem is  there human intelligence is organized to produce something  here human intelligence is disorganized  everybody is a genius but nothing happens  you go and sit in a tea shop  he will be telling you how virat kohli  you know his bat is  he s not holding it right  tch what he should do  the tea shop owner  he will also say how narendra modi does not know this  this  this how he should have done this  how he should have done that  only problem is  he does not know how to make good tea   we must transit from this  we must be a conscious application of genius  not a wild application of genius  it will not produce any results  it will only create problems  it s very important that we organize india to a productive future otherwise we ll work against each other constantly  see  we re driving against each other  all of us could easily drive  with the roads that we have  for the traffic that we have  we could easily drive well  we could easily come  come up with something   okay  everybody must drive minimum sixty kilometers per hours  because there are some very fast drivers  some slow drivers  some who don t know what is driving  some who thinks they are formula 1 racers  all kinds of people are there on the same street  you know  this i realized about twenty years ago or more here  about twenty years ago  when i first went to united states  i m always used to putting my right foot down  full on  so i m hitting like hundred and fifty miles per hour  people say   sadhguru don t do this  they will handcuff you  i said   why  the road is wide open  the engine is good  what s my problem  and i m okay  they said   no  sadhguru  that s not the thing  see here they put seventy  you have to go seventy only  it took me some time to understand  then i looked around  then i see a eighty two year old woman is driving a school bus  then i saw   okay  i can drive at any speed and keep the car on the road  but now this lady who s eighty two is driving a school bus  maybe if i go bhooom like this next to her  we don t what happens to her  then it took me a year to take this passion of putting my right foot down  now i m little controlled and just above the speed limit i am   because i started appreciating the organization  it kind of  for an indian mind it s a little difficult because what i can do  i can do but what about the rest of the organization  the organization has been done so that everybody can participate in it  i may be good at something so i will do it in a certain way  if i want to do that  i must go on a racetrack  you know  i really want to hit two hundred miles per hour  i must go on a racetrack  not on the road  because the road is made for everybody  all kinds of people are driving and most people don t have help even though they re eighty five  ninety  there are ninety year olds driving  you can't drive at hundred miles per hour next to him  but we can easily set this up  i m just taking road as an example  with every aspect of our life  i think india what it lacks is too much genius and not enough organization  you young people must bring that organization into this country so that this intellectual investment or intellectual you know  the bank that we have  the human resource that we have can become a great potential  not a huge problem  it can become a big problem if it is not organized    so we re running a little short of time  it s gonna be the last question we ll be taking  please  microphone  take the microphone   no  i don t need one     there is so much effort and struggle to change and design human mind when we are on the     is there any way to design that      you must use the microphone   microphone is not your requirement  it s my requirement    thank you  madam  i said there is so much effort and struggle to design and shape human mind when we are out of womb  is there any way you know sir to design human mind when we are inside womb  that s my question   at home  is that what you are asking   inside womb   oh  whoa  whoa  whoa   who is pregnant   now if you do not know this  maybe in northern part of the country it s largely almost gone totally  in south it s still little alive in the villages but they re also it s wiped out quite a bit  if you do not know this from preconception to conception to various stages of pregnancy and delivery and as long as the mother is feeding the child there s an entire established process in this country as to how a woman should eat  what she should do  whose kind what kind of people she should interact with  what kind of form she should look at  what kind of form she should not look at  what kind of sounds she should hear  what kind of sound she should not hear  all this was very much there  but we must also understand life has changed  today women are going to work  they have to get into that horrible bus where they re pushed around it doesn t matter she is pregnant and all kinds of things   all kinds of fumes  all kinds of sounds  all kinds of noises  all kinds of abuse  every kind of thing happening to her  in some way we are doing that to the child also  there is no job in the country or in the world where you can take off for one and a half years and get back to the job to fulfill this  in one way because of various things   this is  i m not passing a judgment on this but for various reasons we are not taking the business of manufacturing the next generation of people with sufficient care  tch  we are not paying enough attention to it for which we ll pay a price  over a period of time we will pay an immense price for that  but we are definitely not taking enough care about it in the entire world not just in this country because we ve got all kinds of social situations which does not allow that space for a woman to dedicate that kind of time and attention  see  being pregnant is not just about reproduction  we literally manufacturing the next generation of people  isn t it  is it not important of all the products that you produce on this planet  is it not most important that we produce wonderful human beings for the future generation  is it not the most important thing   but we have created a social situation and an economic situation where there is no such possibility to take care of these things  to whatever extent individual woman or individual families can take care of it they can take care of it but for the larger society it s out of question because things have changed  you can t turn it back just like that   sir  one question  hey  still the child is not born yet   the the intelligence of the body is such if you already do not know this  if a woman delivers a male child  the quality of the milk that she produces is in a certain way  if she delivers a female child the quality of the milk is totally different  if she delivers twin  if she delivers twins  one male and one female  one breast will ooze certain type of milk  another breast will ooze another kind of milk  this is the level of intelligence invested in this body  we have to treat it with that much care  this is not some crude machinery  this is the finest piece of technology on the planet  isn t it  yes or no  this is the finest thing  in the entire evolutionary scale  these millions of years of work that nature did to produce this but in our desperation for economic well being i think we are not paying the kind of attention that this needs  the kind of care that this needs so that this can function at the highest level and can also produce human beings for the future who are of a certain kind  so how to develop the brain when they re in the womb  it s very important that the atmosphere in which the child is growing up in a certain way with the least amount of disturbance  with right kind of reverberations  right kind of sounds  right kind of food  everything  today they re barely nourished the pregnant woman in most part of the country  they re barely nourished  where is the question of right kind of vibrations  right kind of atmospheres  one thing we can do for this is  every home  if possible every working place  we can have a consecrated space  today slowly they are coming up with instruments which can measure the reverberations of certain objects  we can create consecrated spaces or we can create consecrated objects which at least at that time she can carry upon her body so that  kind of to some extent   it s not the best solution   to some extent it neutralizes the outside impact to whatever extent possible  or if she lives in a home the place where she sleeps and other things are taken care of  some amount of respite can be there for there for that new life which is blossoming within the womb  please    sir  by reading ancient scriptures like bhagwat gita or guru grand saheb we tend to become very much pure  we look the world from a different perspective   what  what is that  you become pure   a person becomes pure   but why were they impure   no  why were they impure   because sometimes people are very much unkind   un   unkind   unkind  oh   so we look at the world in a different way  we become very much kind and we develop the tendency of forgiving people but what happens when we go to the work place we realize that because of your this attitude  because you become very much kind and you have the tendency to forgive people the other people they start using you  so what should we do  what a person should do in such cases  should a person stop reading such ancient scriptures like bhagwat gita  guru grant saheb or what is the right age to read such books    now  one thing  the last part of the question that you said  other people will start using you  that means you re not using yourself well  that there is space and time that others can use you  if you re using yourself to the fullest extent nobody will have an opportunity to use you   see  if your let us say you re using something twenty four hours of the day  where will i get the time to use the same thing  so twenty four hours of the day every moment of your life if you are using this  to the fullest extent to do whatever you want to do where is the chance for somebody to use this  if you re not using this  it s good somebody else is using it   now anyway bhagwat gita is not about kindness  krishna is talking about war   he s a very practical person  where there is war needed  he is trying to instigate war  he sees there is no other solution so he is saying let s go to war  somebody else is hesitating  he says  this is it  this is the time to fight  this is not the time to hesitate  where is kindness in this  very simple political sense  what needs to be done is being done  he is only saying don t get caught up in this activity  you need to do it  just do it  don t make too much fuss about it  kindness  tch see  kindness means kindness is useful only for the fallen  isn t it  when you re standing on your feet do you want somebody to be kind to you  hello  let us say you were going to your friend s house every day  they welcomed you and everything  they fed you and took care of you but one day you realized they were doing it simply because they were kind to you  tch  will you feel insulted or no  yes or no  yes or no   yes   only when you re fallen kindness matters  when you re standing on your feet you don t want kindness  you want acceptance  you want respect  you want yes or no  so kindness is only for the sick and the dying not for young  you should not ask for kindness ever  do you want to pass because your professor is kind to you  do you do you want to get a job because somebody is kind to you or because out of your competence you want to get the job  which way is it  do not seek anything in this life out of kindness  that will happen when you re in your death bed  when you can t do anything for yourself  then you expect some kindness  that also if you re very capable you can handle that also  you can walk to your grave and die  i can teach you that technology also   yes  that as you live consciously you can also die consciously  it is possible for a human being to do this  a whole lot of creatures do this  do you know  do you know when a cobra wants to die it  it finds a place somewhere usually on top of a tree  one branch where nobody can reach and just sits there for over twelve for fifteen days without eating and it ll die there  when i first noticed this i didn t figure this  i thought why is this cobra become so skinny  i brought it home and i pour milk into his mouth and i tried to make him eat and then i leave him  he again goes up the tree and sits there  three  four times i bring him down  again he goes up there and sits there and after five days he s dead  so when a crawly creature like a snake has this much awareness that life is coming to an end and he wants to die in a certain way  human beings must have this  isn t it  in this culture we developed this  when a human being knows his life is ebbing  he withdraws  he sits by himself  it s called vanaprastha  he goes into the jungle  sits by himself  slowly leaves his life this body  this is a wonderful way of conducting life  now till the last moment somebody is pumping it because it s an industry   it doesn t matter they want to stretch you for another few hours because few hours will cost a few thousand rupees and whatever else  that s different  so  don t as a young person don t ever look for kindness  let your competence open the doors not somebody s kindness  isn t it   anybody  please  take the microphone take the microphone  where are you  you don t have the microphone
