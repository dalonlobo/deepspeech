sidtoolandtisstoodnsto in the gonwitsit scatetordo  but having every one for  all i i like to extend a very warm vekcomtsadlituetoiveas  a vision for us as an isicute to have you here so before we begin the conversation  like to a who it in context  so when we got to know a about a said lilcaminggiidy  we were thinking of how would it be appropriate to be able to represent the thoughts of the community or in the limited time by limited number of deep  refonothedyaofrobsourcingthefortenesohecal  she bestonsto everyone and be by  wondered with a lot of qushonstandweha time oviling them and so we pripitwypreparedefoculofqorstionsaftherolsoi and oh i will try to represent all the different themes that were as so i just beginning it with a ponosation  like to start with a very silly and yet i xistenshallindfenomentequestion so given that a we are here on the planet for a limited life given that we are human widnotlyve for ever so what do you think is the wise way  the years on this planet  i know what i  and i  and a water while the purpices would like me to say is ray a i was before and her keptemaxs  to this continents but  we must look at this life on this planet  and in the shouottineawa  an insect   animal   i ve  the only thing that every life is aspiring for is it is going to be on a fooflegelie  in a long is trying to be of fonleghdbedlo a grasshopweris lying to be a moflattydressofa  he is trying to be a movelegsangulity so is a human being things we know what is a full vligiuveelan we know what is a olvlitegrassofr  of the what is a fogligti everything but we do not know what is a fovlegumanbeing doesn't matter what you do somehow seems inadequate no matter where you get in your life you will see there is one more thing to do  no adehimandbe come to a place  this this is it  that only other lefoeseveanyounda this is a a  so the sential nature of life not just hrumanlife  eli these it is longing to become a fooflege life so is a human being so will you may be in your life right now you want to be something more  something more happens you want  isontingmoreifthat  and something more  you can see whatever you ask pedicions right now  students i  all of them get fulfilled within the next one year you will immidetlysee you will have another desperation if everything that you want gets all fulfilled by tomorrow morning you will see you will have much more things to do because the very nature of being human is such you always want to be something more but if you really look at it what you want is not something more  what you want is a limitless expansion and if i make you the king of this planet  let me hopefully and  i did not make it in london but  as we make you the king of this blanect  legyouwabefumfilin you will look at the stars if you have this lanterinournans you look at the stars  if you onegeliyyourelookinthenextgalicy this is the nature of the human being that is something within us it is always longing to become boundless but in most human beings  the per of suffering they think that if they desire for something and it doesnt happen the wild suffer because of the fear of suffering this longing to become boundless is finding a very constipated expression this constipated expression of longing for the boundless gets labeled as ambition what you think is ambition is just a constipated expression for a boundless expansion that every life is longing for but you can see in your life no  what happens  see you will want something more  somebody may livlitdersgreed it is not a read because the very nature of the human being is such no matter how many paccifouswelosoficyoutagchhim you cannot contain him people have told you  must be happy with what you have whatever god has given you that should be that i think for you but it s not worked for one human being on the planet  only works either when youre ready sick or very old  otherwise if you have little anergecointoryourbody you wonder is undymovl so it s not more a human being there is something within you which doesn't like boundaries if  in prison you in a five by five giigl eyoumaeteivillinrisont then we reliberatyoudtomorowintoutendbytangupigom you would feel wonderful for a day but again you a re i present the next day we will release you into a hand of my hand of pupicle you re really great but in three days again you ll want a way like he found  doesn't matter when i said that bouly the moment you become conscious of the badly you want to recadbmauntlimis to a in  it is something with the new  i do not like bamaris so you do not like bones what should you seek that to us  as long as you live in the physical nature of the existence the  nature of physicality is a defined bug only because there is a defined boundary physical is possible we can call this a physical body because it has bandics if i will on all the boundaries this was not it is a golenimalr so somewhere unconsciously every human being is wanting to put a dimension beyond physical nature  if you tachtadinandshouldt beyond the physical nature then we use them as much melindandcorrutedwordcolstiagualego virlatilmeans not looking up or looking down spiratyomeans you are excedence of life is ten  the limediions of being vysical some the more than physical is happening to you this  you re understood it or process that this longing is there in every human  sassenalydoesn'twhatyoudoinyourlife our activity is not about us activities about the world of re living today you are here the teuendrepersentualy so you'll

livent of the times  activities always about the times in which we  it's not about us really what times do we exist  is most needed great now thats what we do but how to be is the boston if it comes to how to be  only one way to be that somewhere in every human being there is a longing to  and beyond the visicalimidiions this is happening in four different ways if it kind of very basic physical expression bicaledisecueligy you are trying to expand the boundaries of you are  or not your tranginlodasyourself this is what ticualities if it finds an emotional eprationlecalled is love  again

physical existence has become a living reality for you this everybody s longing  a i'dfindsponstibeted expression instead of that if you find uponsesexxprestion i will be at a very different  so if you said that arketsomoaverycontiniousjoney of ixvenstionandohh having this ponscoursexpresion would make it very different a but this is very easier said than done  doing it is a journey all together so if i m on this journey so i it have personal less be  that have of piichtolisvig so but there is also a fonlickwiththoughthitthesocital life that i live in  there are responsibilities on me from the from my family there are some social boundations that i have my  trying to be limitless so hawdwiwovewiththisconfict or  or in fact i d like to ask that is it even possible that we draw berybetodrawsymtesesbeween the do  you are talking like a much married man and i  this is usalyeeplomaticwayofsayngimattid a way to understand this  everybody is thinking they are saving their own lives and whatever  the human longing to expand is not your doing this is the nature of life itself it's not something that i asked by for this but  i did not a thing  every human being is longing for expansion will a long for it consciously or unconsciously the tollatoicious i may every human being is longing for expansion even the beggar on the street is looking for little expansion of his devlidiryisele is it  so one thing to expand is not your doing or my doing this is the nature of life it in  in us  what we are doing in the world to the is just a question of the times in which we exist i gave me him little choices but then he wanted to art music or indeneringoma of something like this but essentially all this activity is a supposed to be for human by benisintinne so fundamentally it there only one business of human love  question is what is your competence what is the nature of your a you know intelligence so that how you would be most useful so you would just that this does not determine you doing an engineering program or a medical program or an ant  should not decide the nature of who you are that only decides the nature of your activity not the need a well you are so continuing with this thing  what is the aloffogoodo in a butenejourney  is a student of the people if we should have of i find a good and how do we know that that person is actually is

went on experimenting and eighteen years time he gave  i really nothing significant and a building midaghtes when american agencies were fighting drug on the street  in the policy of in the supplies in mexico and selhdamenica decided to fight on the street with the users so this had  somebody said this is not right you give  this man such a big stock we don't know what he is doing  not produced anything eighteen  see the no to is well hayedtelilygonrandlooked at his work they decided to give him stops at many on  and after another the and how four years he came up with this he  that in the human brain there are millions of canniborsresaptus then he threw this question to waios discipline  well it is like to look at it and say at some time in is  every human being was smoking that s why there is a e  this is a is  in many parts of the world it was not there even  shimohasanibusissafte very has never seen anything like this then leldyasthings  then the new olandis came up with this  said always the human brain is waiting but the cannibas that which wasesindoxoition not waiting for it from outside indenery from within that is why  and  so this is something that we have always non i can show you and there always but  i i m always on  but as a at a anybody can be if you do not know intoxication in life  never know a sense of abandon if you don't have a sense of a ban you will never walk full stride in your life you will only walk half steps all the pink only and there is no fear of suffering  or ilyndoxicatedtemfullyawarenot because you consumed substances which we icaayouraavness simply because you re keeping the system at you mechanism a de tires function now it is fully so efficient blistedout all the time now you will not think of all these things i am i  look at this all young people i want  to look at this  in your life would you like to do that which works of  which does not work   she  ineligincisalways looking for that which ksis'ntdi  does not work is not what wivegisterdin that which was  when i am  this one thing howfotortake like a nice boy  this is it is  this is  every experience whatever havens  now lets look at it this way right now all of you those were in that religions on so  seeing even if  lizenidoyouse a   if you see me an  one of your hands and point out where i am a  so  you ve got to wrong  is tick  so in india  so to they you know this light is falling upon me  reflecting going through your lenses in a  codimiondthevedinatouot a story i ended so you see me within yourself  you hear me within yourself are have you seen the whole world but in your  the way it is ejective in the firmament of your mind you have not seeing the world away etes you re seeing it the way it s projected within you  rest hope men on be seeing the world the way you see it  seeing it differently is a   well but he is so the sisinifelently because his visual apple is a man completely different  no that different animals here some years ubsortingsound some hear udresonicsound we we dont hear botltlemn yes we give some thing else so we had all living in the same world but seeing and hearing things completely differently what is day for us  slightfules is darkness for some other creature  darkness with them is light for us  is our instruments of perception are created for our survival process and the instruments of sererival are crafted for this and vivenprocess but now you are indesienceas blosomtoaplace we are sadrivlis not good enough you want to know the nature of life once this longing comes then you must understand the  mens of perception need to be in an  these instruments  senses of sea hearing smellencgistingandtuting they are not good enough because they are only instruments of survival they are not instruments of drumoling because they show you everything in come vadisonewhenaseeverything in tombarisonh now i pysicsweedoll you stand like a  and you walk like a tall man you think like a tall man you are a doleman you in another society what everybody tadeveon said that lelstandlikeashoremanla like a short man think like a short man you are  man is  i am saying what you know in comparison is only good for survival process not be no the nature of life so right now everything that you know is only by company if i do this i feel it s cool no that s not the reality the realities because of my body tempertudid in a certain way i make a judgment that this is cool suppose i lord my body temperature substantially and then i put this this would be one to me is   so what you re perceiving is only become patison what you know by competion is just a distortion of reality it  good enough for saidvival  is not good enough to know the nature of life now  talking about stress and inhsxitn as i said  the weve been taking in him on his to you i am  in some men in the or  and i m doing to work  someone else is cutting an apple is another person in the tent that was undealstiserson carfullitsaveryshepknife  me i call something a knife only for shop what about you  i do something as a knife only if it s really sharp otherwise  olidisrrever i look at this and then i continue my

your life you learn to bring your body and mind  ladyouwodytakesinstuchens om you your mind takes instuctansfromyou  see you you  not preserving them other  you will live a very poor life  odlinebeqas you can only a life of some significance only when your mind and your body works for you not against you is it  at least this much every human being should take tide  so green when to wenbeyham a peak to my friends adam  and when i read of what meditation or yoga is there a that for the orddeovle not for us and then were not very interested in it  no one of my friends said  metedating and i slept

so feloutofthecalenas linterdinioagasynontovinia i   that your gomeansheuhrd not interested in life that's it to do things doing evertingponible to change this perception many things this is not for

my wife  not we heavy but my wake on this to fingers to the fingers like this my nails would bleed out of sheer pressure not injury just hanging onto the rock like that with glass but  do that and  very prouveemigaldatit  day a man who over seventy years of age  less standing there and silently watching  we not  because seventy means but as we he was dead  now a  but i tie of life in change in a

know everything the range of things that this can do this is all i know in my life i know this piece of life from its origenttotuldemit people think i know ever inthat'stheirproblo  the  so there s a lot of talk about our country in  these days so even  in the world fledformswithheseethat the things are improving but going to the most of india  see the history of a civilization we see that in the opertaltrofhestansoultverlrelywhenit comes to developing ways of  and if i pientialways of realizing this of inner truth about ourselves or no  body in the hightrotstrosalexperdencialwes so what do you think was it that  were yet to do properly that we were eve to discover these things and and not as the we would not just able to discover but also  proiridethenintothesocialegosystem what was it that led us to us as into a long spell of peaceful civilized life a long spell we must understand this the reason ive got this long spell is in the not we will predicted by the himolenranges in the

simply because before so if you go this way what will happen to the world is things if you  look back at the glorious history of this country  simply because it is to you in to  so you can really lendlatysociethy  a net  a world  by talking about it led by building individual homenvengs  tuligrat withoutredhumanlesvhereisatliatsociety society is just a word nation  is just a word  just a word

if if dengtwentidgenodicions of etxclemeporty this is this mentelstrectorandthiseganomicsucher  the consequence of fifteen to twenty generations of extreme poverty many banhoverdivinsida a

this basin manywaysof  the types of education in a nation we have what what of these aidearichisinrudelindia which includes our own schools a manyfowistowardspeaching english language cumproersinses regular acedtomakeeducation out a serdtin level in discipline and well being held and well being  smentismostimpotedtintheveliges and get them out of the relage  to get out of that economic and so shallbitidiththeyare education is just a baseball for them that  eleven of education and at the level of education we have what is a honschool this is for the little more affluent people happens inside the oversent of itself we have a huge track of land and readiousfeility these golds iunin a certain way the children live with two dedicated house parents and everything to school  so it inside the house the ted  so only  i don lavertreandlabriesstel everything is inside the house these stone expensive an expensive way of deloing education but this is done by dedicated people as a rule we never take any plantees we have a doctor and deneansaccounten  and to people but not dranteages because we want education to happen as an inspiration not as putting you all the shoving down in information down to be his rope  a insipasionchillem should get the spark of wanting to know something that is a whole range of activity of the  a  i  a  things many  vermin  a visthadnowinprovisionalfootballingermany so like this stem going at a waithistnhing the school gives an enormous range of things and i made this now leventhdwell i made a flies not to is the as i said one  because by the time they got  eleventh a whole lot of redangwigetmocksmader  vested so much time in music theatre and many many things now levinstandardguns and everything is dropped the justutgingonlytanagatmocks is a three as  you staderasiethe  one thing is nobody wants to ribrothechildrenthis  to happen ten if i isagle everybody would have no redrandte children now nobody wants to

well they're highly qualified but they can  the content the  convaiethey  any dating except going to work really this an unfortnathingdesnot life so so i thought we must invest enough in the children before tgetintoprofesionalcolleges we have been less enough in their art music sport  it of interest uticsplowmanythings this another school which we qualities are semtigoothy here if any child in  comwellsiythemusdaywith us as a commitment with rebius only it the commitment we take the children he is not hedemixe on an liovan caloliwydowhichis the mother of all marshela a ousincellabygecavaloe yes cola   lsicldansplas the music and  languid and englishlanag this is all the line you must see this children on belief they are a different set of human beings at it  the focus is just is  vlipinghumanbodyandhumanbrandoitsfolestrwithataperpose i am doing this because this is how i grew up i grew up without a purpose my father was weakbeates heaven  what was this boy do is not getting qualified for anything  wousayif i am not qualified for a  i can do just about everything  so these children i growing up in to do  mostamastedyou will it unless you see  dystontelunaxpiience from age of six to eighteen deaditas after that divlevishteycansta  they can go and do what they want to do  many things that they can do which is uportigtemtobo from fifteen to eighteen they become monks for

amidthembo into it as children  the biomemadens they must come out of it it is they cannot choose to continue so first bats i wonder  inside no another is coming now in july the third one the first bad man i andrinishite about three years ago six is fifteen  old children the  on sixty days of silence morningtlythirty two eightterty in the evening theyre in some kind of you get sudden i am of eight hours of the keeping their i closed and sitting okay and of the foldehad left for to the nice  see how this bosandgosadoing for being of them in the first bad  we the received money to the thirty i went and sat in the room these eight boys and six girls were sitting there or a fogetisin my life they were just a thing that like that believe me litallygloing i said with it because  never seen to re like is in my life i was not like this when i was fifteen for so the a beyond anything that you can think of simply because they are focused  developing the human mechanism to its fullest not about how do on my live in theres not a question in here with  one millions of your brain and on a living its such a big brain in in a living is  to be problem it is  most  is way to approach life is i will i earn my living everybody can under living the only problem comes in your life when you want to live like somebody else  to prove  but earning a living is not a problem  if you just make what is considered sadevivleminimal on one exegiditing it then you an see you have a whole lot of time and opportunity  great what you want in your life but keep on raising the bottom surlivl so much that they will not get to do anything in their life except surviving in the i don't know why this a lot so i think there's a lot of curiosity in the audience of a filling up so oh unless you have some

very much willing to do that with you it's my recent my blessing this must have  to every youth of this  because india the people of india has suffered immensely  what exxtendolifhywdexposem he from

everything is okay it's time we we have a living humanity that our heart beats was everything our ardblapswateverything  and we will do the best we can do in  as if we do not do what we cannot do there's no problem but if we do not do what we can do we are a  this life isn't it myricsenmudblessingueshal  that i got  i actually nowbeginwidtheaginshuaran  and an oseguistiongaindreasons  he had

anyret but little off a lithnicalece see whether people are conscious of  or not conscious of it every human being knowingly or unknowingly or sickingsalutionshoweemwerteon isn't it  or in other words the nature of human intelligence is such that that i i you are it is a problem yes  happen  okay for telucilandindecitius that is via   husband and wife who or seven years of  it s celiblatingwiththatforttyfiftoridinganimosl  so they decided i go through everything just the way it happened on the wedding day so wedding got  into the churchrhevthegotmadied they came out of it at the same time  as the didontunta they want a romantic italian movie  then after that they went for a dinner in a particular a strong they had the same kind of food and the same kind of wine and they are driving then the wife said john what happened with you do you remember forty five years  when we were driving  patonlatelyoukissme so he said okay  not love  now what is otifiaslier at the divenwaelitgas so he died of this  and unfortunately for it  live your bodies not the same and the cadaffaster and bomedtheenilebrage so they were at the gates of heaven then they got checked in together and i was both of them but i got worse asked is the  of course in heaven can be the i  is the best botowoseyoureofvemerseen so can we see so fine this side was an amacolat course as a  teelshesitatetime and  the time in having they  it so  don't have our clubs no brother just waryofeget for you  so so the man teed off splitting the fairway a and long  the lady walked up to the lady lady's tee and teed off again that and they were walking towards the ball for the second shot so that y the husband became depressed as it usually many times happens to the husbands she looked at him and to  as the problem in in heaven the besticglofcous you had a great shot i had a great  you so depressed he said if it was not for your stupid health  i could i come here long time ago  so this is the nature of human until because it gets only one face of everything it  is thinking some  it is a problem then you don't have a probe your desolved  i m  you are not a problem you're a possibility when people  most people most people when they utter the word human this oh i am only a human then all was evfeling to the word human as a limitation problem then i feel pbepelesssaing i am human revflingto the immensity of being human because most people have not explored the immensity of what it means to be human is why there is so much talk about  a garden so many things  people have failed to explore  immensity of what it means to be human if you extlaregtefulldeapanddiennof it means to be human then you dont wadyablutdisillution because is it true is it true that you were not born this way  decide as you are to be and   slowly or cummelity  i just  the doritoniscentt to acammelitecanbeyour  you cannot say to me isn't it hello as i m speaking i speak of this vescelantitis  yes  then you will think  has some problem but  he says he s wise let us listen some more after some time i  is me the teletca and now it's dangerous since  this you doing every day to the ears on  late you say this is my food you  and then you say this is me you  if you at this point to day that the body that two catiesjustofeceof the planet today if you get it experientially your life will change today otherwise one day you will anivigated from the maggots it a bit later so dissolution does not mean destruction this illusion means you broke the boundaries of your individuality because you had indiidul existence is a me that you have created you are very much individual you  like the person sitting next to regnole so don breathe the air that the  no aningthis losyoueknowslikethisholdedl with two minutes you know that without communication you won't last for a moment this is not just with a espolition this is a deva particle in this body without being in communication with a and got existence this cannot exist for a moment to  fusion is not something that you have to do  if you drop the conclusions that you have made about yourself this is already dissolved modern dassisis telligodtis sent it you alderdydisolveou  have to dissolve  it is just that you have a fancy idea in your head to get that idea out thesthespooitulroces spitittupracses is not a the olprocess

for which you  in education and having graduated from this place  i dont know why i did indiniting onyoroffiaation be  in  out of that flusration of why an doing  and i wanted to work in the education sector  dinteiamwooking  feel  i at many calinis to bring about the ten in the system of how things so  in an hole denotdod it is mad it is a vidysnalbroces of who things more than how much you try that  it should be a elitictiloveman in this and that thing boidowntdooggeheget a bolosgiebagiggonolgoo so i want to ask you if you  you can give some tips on how your how you would think of how education should be ganmematoessceedup you get a hatstorrimader it there in some white of the conduit  even this and i  felhemideditciagain in s in the system of education so what if he how  make this happen icalogelivin i  if we had always thinking of changing the system and not think it should not it should  but within the existing systems we can do many things depending upon the individual teachers and individual educators how they operate because when you tried to ten the system in your own time when you want to change the system you must understand  and esisn even within the family if you want to change a system it will take many years is not in a night sometimes a denelationastobass  but it butanes to walk in your house with your shoes on ondenaitinaddtopass is in   and so thinking how betanedthesystem yes  have vision of ten in the system  within the  so how to do the maximum delivery is something that all over should always look  otherwise we are always talking about future nations without addressing the colningeny it ll never walk that way it longibeabree we have to make the difference in the cutengen in only then it would be dismonsefo the next denolitionwiltikeabegesstep but without taking this step  dreaming of a big step it will not happen will be just an idea which will not work so as an educator you mentioned the word meditation we must understand this what meditation means the word meditation  niswordmeditation doesn't mean anything if somebody sits with their eyes closed  i think their meditating but you can sit with your close for men a is  a able to be  or you can close your eyes it   you may be and you get that a man i think  idea a thatanodonasamidesoniasomesomumer odoadingso that is the  a meditation is not specific  to general and it's not saying anything in medical  to say he s thinking to align the word meditation what we left was done a gana  a nun as you will see in this peaginvebele  way of keeping away the words in the end  we said a man is a round said the anamisyosadon you're cutting off everything in the  so a option but if you are thinking it is iinouyaathwatever what this means is  you sit  if you sit  if you  if you have a distinct experience that your body is here you minded someminelse you is elsewhere in other words i is a little when what is you and what is your body what is you and what is the content of your mind suppose this little space with a chip with a new retnaw would all his young boys be complaining about stress you must do wanting if you were an aviator you would know this you're driving to the airport trafficdemcutecdamceficgdan so you go over  and on can do all this and get there then you fly then you ll flag over the traffic jam you told looks at a nine sitol simply because of the distance when you were in it it was  tedbuoking you have lyingabavit it looks quite nice eculletroti  one that at the little distance that end of suffering if the  litingspaceofwitweenyou on your body between  your mind  is the end of suffering because that only two kinds of sufferings in your life physical suffering mentdondsovl do you know any other kind of siftling  litolsivinxs  yodistendse yourself a little bit that's all  distancing is not by attitude anuatthesaeccomalitions  gathered this body you the disimind  he what belongs to you one way and what is you in another way y'stackengetoff so we can get you a simple method which you can do this very  simple process  human being is capable of this lets under and then  canstiexternarealities i was a differently capable hum and begs are equally capable when it comes to inner possibilities all of vesadequallycapable no human being has come better endowed than the other it is just that most human beings never look in that direction now most is a bit man i m here  my name is common i m here with my wife my mother  thakgisoacuocomingher we have been a folingyovidanctformanyyearssnow  it inspired us to you mention about i i i  it is loclearedmyiseyolyounganyercalint do is magueinvitedtheyouhthevindenomit  a banlodasanresolindiacallengtesand no i would like to ask you that the media tannactingthis is that people find the bassionandtowarde  i should be able to positively contribute the society and so the biggest challenge but we see you know that there are so many practical situations  youngevlresentodao but you can truth how can we do this more and we up more and more young people that only to they follow their passion  they must connect to nationbuilinganan so in the piggesshangesoffornimeas the youth here which is as i said no  and has how she had in the basic a covoet how can you make it more ingopetentio that it becomes a movement  he menordelydowhatdeylove  to make a postobathow  this more and get a large number of young  to get into this conitation you are a man i m willing to speak to any young people or old people i i don't see youth as inimilygoantity  late young people up pretty old complaining about stress being young or old is not just of age not the question of you but day when you were born have you are you an exivlantlie or have you become youdminclive in the making an pasiwillitiesradopen that s what you miss you  become conceited yet you should not be a tank  you are not made your conclusions about life is to me willing to look at everything fresh that ordyuldmes i think it s the business of every human being to stay that way all that life that you never make your conclusions you become a constant explet and then a seeking in
