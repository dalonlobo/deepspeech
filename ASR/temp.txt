ref = [u' in today s event', u'three of our students will be in conversation with sadhguru', u'on the theme of youth and truth ', u'this is the first event in this series', u'in which sadhguru will be in conversation with students', u'on the theme of youth and truth ', u'i now request ishan  saksham and om prakash to come on the stage  ', u'ishan is a final year dual degree computer science student ', u'saksham is a third year engineering physics student', u'and om prakash is a final year m tech mechanical engineering student  ', u'now i hand it over to sadhguru and the students', u'to begin the conversation ', u' namaskaram to everyone ', u' good evening  everyone ', u'first of all i would like to extend a very warm welcome to sadhguru to iit ', u'it s a very rare occasion for us as a institute to have you here ', u'so before we begin the conversation', u'i would just like to put it in context ', u'so when we got to know about sadhguru coming to iit', u'we were thinking of', u'how would it be appropriate to be able to represent of the thoughts of the community', u'in the limited time by limited number of people', u'so we thought of the idea of crowd sourcing the questions', u'so we crowd sourced the question to everyone', u'and people responded with a lot of questions', u'and we had a hard time compiling them ', u'so we prepared a cocktail of questions after crowd sourcing', u'and we ve tried to represent all the different themes that are asked ', u'so just beginning with the conversation', u'i d like to start with a very silly and yet existential and fundamental question ', u'so given that we are here on this planet for a limited life ', u'given that we are human  we would not live forever ', u'so what do you think is the wise way', u'to spend the years on this planet  ', u' i know what', u'can you hear me ', u'i know what all the professors would like me to say  ', u'the wise is way is you must be focused on your academics ', u'that s all the concern is but', u'we must look at this ', u'all life on this planet ', u'anything that you take ', u'a worm ', u'an insect ', u'a bird ', u'an animal ', u'a tree', u'or a human being ', u'the only thing that every life is aspiring for is', u'it is trying to become a full fledged life ', u'an earthworm is trying to be an full fledged earthworm ', u'a grasshopper is trying to be a full fledged grasshopper ', u'a mango tree is trying to be a full fledged mango tree ', u'so is a human being ', u'only thing is we know what is a full fledged earthworm ', u'we know what is a full fledged grasshopper ', u'we know what is a full fledged everything', u'but we do not know what is a full fledged human being ', u'doesn t matter what you do', u'somehow seems inadequate ', u'no matter where you get in your life', u'you will see there is one more thing to do ', u'never does a human being come to a place', u'where he thinks this is it ', u'that only other people say when you re dead ', u'this is it  ', u'so', u'the essential nature of life not just human life ', u'every life is', u'it is longing to become a full fledged life ', u'so is a human being ', u'so wherever you may be in your life right now', u'you want to be something more ', u'if that something more happens', u'you want to be something more ', u'if that happens something more ', u'you will see whatever your aspirations right now', u'as students suppose', u'all of them get fulfilled within the next one year ', u'you will immediately see you will have another aspiration ', u'if everything that you want gets all fulfilled by tomorrow morning', u'you will see you will have much more things to do', u'because the very nature of being human is such', u'you always want to be something more ', u'but if you really look at it', u'what you want is not something more ', u'what you want is a limitless expansion ', u'even if i make you the king of this planet', u'don t look at me hopefully  ', u'i will not make such a blunder  ', u'but suppose we make you the king of this planet ', u'do you believe you will be fulfilled ', u'you will look at the stars ', u'if you have this planet in your hands', u'you will look at the stars ', u'if i give you one galaxy you will look at the next galaxy  ', u'this is the nature of the human being ', u'there is something within us', u'which is always longing to become boundless ', u'but in most human beings', u'because of their fear of suffering', u'they think that if they desire for something and it doesn t happen they will suffer ', u'because of the fear of suffering', u'this longing to become boundless is finding a very constipated expression ', u'this constipated expression of longing for the boundless', u'gets labeled as ambition ', u'what you think is ambition is just a constipated expression', u'for a boundless expansion that every life is longing for ', u'but you will see in your life', u'no matter what happens', u'you will see you will want something more ', u'this somebody may label it as greed ', u'it is not about greed', u'because the very nature of the human being is such', u'no matter how many pacifists  philosophies you teach him', u'you cannot contain him ', u'people have told you ', u'you must be happy with what you have ', u'whatever god has given you that should be the right thing for you', u'but it s not worked for one human being on this planet ', u'it only works either when you re very sick or very old ', u'otherwise if you have little energy coursing through your body', u'you want to do something more ', u'so it s not more ', u'a human being', u'there is something within you which doesn t like boundaries ', u'if i imprison you in a five by five cubicle', u'you will feel terribly imprisoned ', u'then we will liberate you tomorrow into a ten by ten cubicle ', u'you will feel wonderful for a day', u'but again you will feel imprisoned ', u'the next day we will release you into a hundred by hundred cubicle ', u'you will feel really great', u'but in three days again you ll want to break that boundary ', u'it doesn t matter where i set the boundary ', u'the moment you become conscious of the boundary', u'you want to break that boundary ', u'this is the nature of the human being ', u'so there is something within you', u'which does not like boundaries ', u'so if you do not like boundaries', u'what should you seek  that s a question ', u'as long as you live in the physical nature of the existence', u'the very nature of physicality is a defined boundary ', u'only because there is a defined boundary physical is possible ', u'we can call this a physical body', u'because it has boundaries ', u'if i pull out all the boundaries', u'this will not be physical anymore ', u'so somewhere unconsciously', u'every human being is wanting to touch a dimension beyond physical nature ', u'if you touch a dimension beyond the physical nature', u'then we use the much maligned and corrupted word called spirituality ', u'spiritual means not looking up or looking down ', u'spiritual means your experience of life has transcended', u'the limitations of being physical ', u'something more than physical is happening to you ', u'this means you are on the spiritual process ', u'so this longing is there in every human being', u'so essentially it doesn t  what you do in your life ', u'our activity is not about us ', u'activity is about the world that we live in ', u'today you are here in twenty first century so you guys are in iit ', u'suppose you were here 5000 years ago where would you be ', u' in a jungle ', u' hmm  no  no  ', u'you know  5000 years ago they were talking mahabharata  ramayan', u'so you would be in one of those armies trying to shoot a arrow   ', u'hey  you can t shoot anything  ', u'you were trying to learn to fight with somebody in a sword or something else of the day ', u'i m saying your mind ', u'your application ', u'your fulfillment in activity would be all that type of activity relevant to the times ', u'our activity is always about the times in which we exist ', u'it s not about us really ', u'what times do we exist ', u'what is most needed right now  that s what we do ', u'but how to be is the question ', u'if it comes to how to be', u'there s only one way to be', u'that somewhere in every human being there is a longing', u'to expand beyond physical limitations ', u'this is happening in four different ways ', u'if it finds a very basic physical expression we call this sexuality ', u'you are trying to expand the boundary of who you are ', u'what you are not you are trying to include as yourself ', u'this is what sexuality is ', u'if it finds an emotional expression we call this love ', u'once again something that is not you ', u'you are trying to make it a part of you ', u'if it finds a mental expression it gets labeled as', u'ambition ', u'greed ', u'conquest', u'or simply shopping  ', u'if it finds a conscious process then we call it yoga ', u'yoga means not twisting your body or turning your body ', u'yoga means union ', u'in some way consciously you learn', u'how to obliterate the boundaries of your individual nature ', u'now your ability to experience yourself beyond your physical existence', u'has become a living reality for you ', u'this is everybody s longing', u'but it finds constipated expression ', u'instead of that if you find a conscious expression ', u'life will be very  very different ', u' so you said that it s a very continuous journey of expansion and', u'like having this conscious expression would make it very different', u'but this is very easier said than done ', u'so like doing it is a journey all together ', u'so if i m on this journey', u'so i d have personal aspirations ', u'i d have spiritual aspirations', u'but there s also a conflict with the societal life that i live in ', u'there are responsibilities on me from my family ', u'there are some social boundations that i have', u'while trying to be limitless ', u'so how do i cope with this conflict ', u'or in fact i d like to ask that', u'is it even possible that we are able to draw a synthesis between the two ', u' you are talking like a much married man  ', u'this is usually a diplomatic way of saying i m married  ', u'see  we need to understand this ', u'though everybody is thinking they are shaping their own lives and whatever ', u'the human longing to expand is not your doing ', u'this is the nature of life itself ', u'it s not something that i aspire for a spiritual process ', u'there s no such thing ', u'every human being is longing for expansion ', u'will they long for it consciously or unconsciously', u'that s all the choice is ', u'anyway every human being is longing for expansion ', u'even the beggar on the street is looking for little expansion of his territory  isn t it ', u'yes or no ', u'so wanting to expand is not your doing or my doing ', u'this is the nature of life ', u'it s invested in us ', u'now what we are doing in the world today', u'is just a question of the times in which we exist ', u'okay  we have little choices ', u'whether you want to do art  music or engineering or medicine or', u'something like this but essentially all this activities', u'are supposed to be for human well being  isn t it ', u'so fundamentally there s only one business of human well being ', u'the question is', u'what is your competence ', u'what is the nature of your  you know ', u'intelligence so that how you could be most useful so you will choose that ', u'this does not determine ', u'you doing an engineering program or a medical program or an art program', u'should not decide the nature of who you are ', u'that only decides the nature of your activity ', u'not the nature of who you are ', u' so continuing with this', u'what is the role of a guru in a person s journey  ', u'how do we students or as people over here ', u'how do we find a guru', u'and how do we know that  that person is actually', u'a guru is actually leading us to the correct path ', u' if he confuses the hell out of you', u'and you still like him  he s your guru', u' ', u'if somebody is trying to help you to find certainty', u'in an uncertain world', u'he is not your guru ', u'he is trying to sing a lullaby to you  you understand ', u'the nature of life is such', u'that every moment it is changing and evolving into something else', u'but somebody tries to create certainty ', u'don t worry  god will take care of you ', u'god is holding your hand ', u'everything will be fine ', u'everything will be fine ', u'they ve been saying this for a long time', u'but life has buggered people very badly in so many ways ', u'yes', u'so this is not about inventing', u'a psychological certainty', u'and getting completely delinked from the reality of the existence ', u'the nature of the existence is such', u'nothing can be stagnant here ', u'it is only the dynamic nature from atomic to cosmic', u'that is keeping the existence going', u'including the human being and every other life ', u'so a guru is not somebody who ll give you solace ', u'he is a solution because', u'the only reason why you may need him is', u'because it s an unfamiliar terrain ', u'see  every year i trek in the himalayas ', u'indian part or generally now in nepal and tibet ', u'there this sherpa guy who leads me on ', u'well  your lungs will be in your mouth ', u'you are at eighteen thousand feet', u'and your lungs is in your mouth', u'and you re determined ', u'you re going step by step ', u'they re two roads  this looks nice and easy ', u'this guy says  ', u'he won t say ', u'sadhguru ji  please  this is the way  ', u'no    ', u'he s carrying my bags and he s illiterate', u'but he says  like this ', u'without argument i follow ', u'though this looks better to me i just follow', u'because i know he knows the terrain better than me ', u'i know the mountains very well', u'but still i know he knows it better than me ', u'once i recognize that it is sensible to follow him ', u'if you do your own thing you won t last ', u'the same thing goes with the inner terrain ', u'when you go into a terrain that s unfamiliar to you ', u'it s best to go with somebody who s already walked the terrain', u'otherwise to find your neighborhood', u'you may round the planet and come back ', u'that is also one way', u'but it s a brief life  ', u' so i want to bring to a different theme', u' why you  why are you copying questions  ', u' i just wanted to', u' i ve seen people copying answers but  ', u' as students a lot of us', u'especially in institute like iit', u'we did a survey and we found that', u'a lot of students are under stress', u'and we re used to a reward and punishment mechanism ', u'so till the time there s no sword hanging on us ', u'till the time there s no deadline ', u'we ll procrastinate and we ll wait for things to happen', u'and that s when we do ', u'and when we talked to students', u'they say that  this is the way we know how to work ', u'this is the way we are trained ', u'and related this many of them say that fear of failure', u'sometimes motivates them ', u'and they say that this is essential', u'and this is how things have to happen ', u'is that so that this is only way we can work', u'or because it sometimes makes us feel very restricted ', u'is there a way where we can be free of this ', u' see  let s understand this in a more fundamental way ', u'see  when we say stress ', u'when we say anxiety ', u'when we say depression ', u'when we say misery or', u'when we say joy ', u'when we say bliss ', u'when we say ecstasy or love or whatever ', u'all human experience comes from within you ', u'is this so  all of you ', u'i m asking for a higher opinion   ', u'is this so ', u' yes ', u' all human experience happens from within you ', u'at least what happens from within you must happen the way you want it ', u'yes or no ', u'now you are still in a university ', u'once you step out into the larger world  tch ', u'this is a very protected world that you re living in ', u'if this you re thinking sword is hanging on your head', u'you ll have a bomb ticking ', u'once you step out ', u'this is a very comfortable life ', u'very protected life ', u'here nothing is hanging on you ', u'okay  yes ', u'you need to pass your examinations  whatever ', u'there are some challenges i m not saying no ', u'but all human experience happens from within ', u'whatever comes from within you', u'can i assume that you are doing it ', u'if something sweet comes out of you right now can i assume you are saying something sweet ', u'something nasty comes out of you can i assume you re saying it ', u' yes ', u' or is it your ego  ', u' i think the ego then ', u' because this has become the way of the world ', u'people have found all kinds of fall guys  ', u'spiritual fall guys', u'and civil fall guys ', u'if they do something wonderful they say it s me ', u'if they do something nasty they say it s that mr  ego ', u'that guy does this ', u'if they do something wonderful in the world they say it s me ', u'something go  little goes wrong in their life', u'they ll find one little guy here', u'and say it s because of him ', u'if something big goes wrong in their life', u'they ll find one big guy there and say it s because of him  ', u'this  guy is missing ', u'this guy needs to come into the play ', u'only when this guy comes into play you call that life ', u'yes ', u'when this guy play this is called life ', u'if that guy plays i don t know what it means ', u'this guy plays ', u'this is rubbish ', u'everything that goes on in my life', u'somebody who can t stand up to me he s responsible ', u'something big goes wrong in my life  he s responsible ', u'this one is missing ', u'one who is missing', u'how can he experience life ', u'how can he create life ', u'how can he know life ', u'so this guy has to come into play ', u'so one important thing that needs to happen in the world today is', u'we have to move from religion to responsibility', u'applause', u'we have been slinking around with life ', u'when things happen i m there', u'when it don t happen  somewhere  somewhere ', u'no ', u'if you understand it s me who is causing anxiety to myself', u'not my examination ', u'when i joined the institution i know there are going to be examinations  isn t it ', u'what is causing anxiety is not something else ', u'my inability to handle my own thought and my emotion  isn t it ', u'if it so happened', u'your left hand is free right now ', u'your left hand is free ', u'suppose it pops up and punches you in the face ', u'what will you do   ', u'i will ask him to restrain the left hand  ', u'if it doesn t work', u'we ll ask them to tie it up ', u'if it doesn t work at all ', u'if it s going to pull out your eyeballs', u'then we may have to amputate it ', u'yes or no ', u'right now that is all you re trying to do ', u'to beat the anxiety you ll drown yourself in alcohol ', u'to beat the anxiety you burn yourself down with smoke ', u'what you re trying to do is', u'amputate yourself', u'because you don t know how to handle the potential of being human ', u'your problem is very evolutionary ', u'when i say evolutionary ', u'see  do you know  ', u'i mean you re all engineering students', u'so i m asking do you know', u'do you know the dna difference between you and a chimpanzee is only 1 23 percent ', u'1 23 percent is not much of a difference  isn t it  ', u'yes or no ', u'physiologically that is how close to a chimpanzee you are ', u'but in terms of your intelligence ', u'intellect and awareness', u'you are worlds apart from a chimpanzee ', u'or in other words', u'your intellect or this cerebral activities', u'in evolutionary scale it s of recent origin ', u'it s new ', u'you ve still not learned how to deal with it ', u'you have an intelligence', u'for which you don t have a stable enough base ', u'the only and only reason', u'you suffer either misery or anxiety or depression or whatever  ', u'this may sound very cruel to you', u'but the reality is this ', u'that your own intelligence has turned against you ', u'it is like you ve been given a sharp knife ', u'you don t know how to handle it ', u'every day you keep cutting yourself', u'and you think there is something wrong with the knife ', u'no ', u'you don t have steady hand ', u'if your intelligence worked for you one hundred percent', u'would you create blissfulness or misery for yourself ', u'joy or misery', u'please chose right now', u'i m going to bless you  ', u' joy ', u' for yourself you clearly know', u'highest level of pleasantness is what you want ', u'what you want for your neighbor is debatable ', u'what you want for yourself is very  very clear  isn t it ', u'so you create ghosts of you own', u'and try to fight them ', u'can i tell you a joke ', u'you okay  ', u'no  because you re from delhi i m asking you  ', u'an indian man', u'probably from an iit ', u'went to united states', u'of course as a technology person to start with ', u'then he started dabbling with some investments ', u'then he started playing the stock market ', u'in 1996 i think ', u'four or six i m not sure ', u'in one of those years he had a windfall in the american stock market ', u'that year he earned the highest amount of money on the us stock market', u'which is not a small amount ', u'it s a huge sum ', u'he was already over sixty years of age ', u'just the previous year he was divorced  ', u'timely divorced it happened', u'because in california law', u'you have to share fifty percent with the wife ', u'just one year ahead of this windfall the wife had left him', u' ', u'and he wanted to spend this money upon himself', u'so he bought himself a 1932 ferrari', u'for thirty six million dollars ', u'he bought a beverly hills home for eighty million dollars ', u'then he was over sixty ', u'he wants to live long', u'so he thought he needs a medical checkup ', u'in northern california', u'there are medical institutions which are swankier than seven star hotels', u'and you can go there ', u'not some dreary medical checkup  in one day  everything ', u'fifteen days you can get admitted for a fortnight', u'and you can choose your tests unlike you ', u'you can t choose your tests  ', u'you can choose your tests ', u'all kinds of esoteric tests are there ', u'you can choose what kind of tests you want to go through ', u'so the entire space was nice ', u'the appointed a very pretty looking young woman to take care of him ', u'he was enjoying the entire process ', u'on the fourth day he was feeling very relaxed in the evening', u'and he was lying on his bed ', u'unfortunately what should happen in the toilet', u'happened upon the bed ', u'he felt very embarrassed', u'and he did not know how to handle this mess ', u'not knowing how to hand this mess', u'he was just looking how to do this ', u'just then he heard this young woman coming towards the room ', u'in america fortunately', u'young ladies don t', u'cannot walk quietly ', u'they walk tok  tok  tok  tok  ', u'so when he heard this tok  tok  tok ', u'she knows  he knows she is coming ', u'he does not want this young lady to see the mess on the bed ', u'so he just gathered all the hospital white sheets', u'and threw it out of the fifth floor window ', u'down below a regular man was going home from a party', u' ', u'and it s such an unfair world ', u'because a man is expected to walk on a round planet', u'and the damn thing is spinning all the time ', u'this you realize only when you have had a few m  few drops too many or', u'few drops between your ears are gone  ', u'so he was walking sideways and slowly finding his way home ', u'then these sheets came and covered him  ', u'then he screamed and yelled and fought with these sheets ', u'it took him over two minutes to get the sheets down ', u'then the sheets got down and he was looking at the sheets dazed ', u'the security arrived hearing all this commotion ', u'they said   what is all the commotion about ', u'the man said', u'it looks like i ve beaten the shit out of a ghost ', u' ', u'so it s your thought ', u'what happens in your mind is your thought  isn t it ', u'it s your emotion', u'unfortunately ', u'unfortunately our education systems from an early age', u'have not thought you this much ', u'how to handle your thought ', u'how to handle your emotion  tch ', u'if you did not know how to handle your hands', u'it would be a mess  isn t it ', u'this you will know if you come to tamil nadu ', u'you will suddenly realize', u'tamil people can use their fingers far better than you ', u'that is  on a banana leaf they will put rice and rasam ', u'you will see it ll go all over the place ', u'but they won t let a drop go anywhere ', u'in two minutes it ll be dry', u'just with their fingers  ', u'so everybody can get to use', u'what they have much better', u'than the way they re handling it right now  isn t it ', u'if you knew how to handle your thought and emotion', u'would you think anxiety is a problem ', u'would you think stress is a problem ', u'tension is a problem ', u'would you think such things would exist for you ', u'so essentially it is our inability to handle our own thought process ', u'our own emotions', u'that all this is happening ', u'instead of learning to handle it', u'we are giving labels to all our inabilities ', u'all kinds of exotic titles for ourselves ', u'no ', u'this is not the way to go about it ', u'i am telling you this is the easiest part of your life ', u'being in a protected institution like this ', u'getting the best of academics', u'and you just have to pass an examination ', u'that s all ', u'once you step out it s another game  ', u' you said that this is the easiest part of your life as a student', u'but we see that a lot of youngsters fall into the clutches of stress ', u'depression', u'and to cope with that they go to the addictions like alcohol  drug  porn  internet etcetera', u'and they think that it will give them relief ', u' i didn t know internet was along with the drugs  ', u' so how to deal with them ', u' look at me  i m always stoned', u' ', u'never been on a substance', u'but you must understand', u'whatever stimulants', u'whatever stimulus you may take from outside', u'essentially human experience of all kinds', u'is caused only from within ', u'the question is only', u'are you on push start or are you on self start ', u'which is better technologically ', u' self start ', u' self start ', u'so if i teach you ', u'suppose i teach you', u'that you can simple sit here and be totally blissed out ', u'more stoned than anybody on the campus  ', u'at the same time you re fully aware ', u'would you go for it ', u'hmm ', u'would you go for it ', u'fully stoned ', u'fully conscious ', u'would you go for it ', u' yes ', u' see the only problem with your alcohol  drugs  everything', u'is not a moral issue ', u'it is a life issue because it destroys life ', u'it s not a morality that', u'this is good  this is bad  that s not the point ', u'the point is it makes you incapable in so many ways ', u'there was a certain israeli scientist', u'who was researching on marijuana or cannabis ', u'over eighteen years', u'the us drug and  drug administration gave him large quantities of marijuana', u'and he went on experimenting and eighteen years  time', u'he came up with really nothing significant', u'and during mid eighties when american agencies were fighting drug on the street ', u'they changed their policy of', u'fighting the suppliers in mexico and south america ', u'they decided to fight on the street', u'with the users ', u'so they said', u'somebody said this is not right ', u'you re giving this man such a big stock ', u'we don t know what he is doing', u'because he had not produced anything ', u'eighteen years of research ', u'then he moved to israel ', u'the israeli government looked at his work', u'and they decided to give him', u'big stocks of marijuana ', u'and after another three and a half  four years he came up with this ', u'he found that in the human brain', u'there are millions of cannabis receptors ', u'then he threw this question to various disciplines ', u'anthropologist tried to look at it and say', u'at some time in history', u'maybe every human being was smoking that s why the receptors ', u'then they said this is rubbish', u'because in many parts of the world it was not there ', u'even a eskimo has cannabis receptors', u'where he has never seen anything like this ', u'then various things happened', u'then the neurologists came up with this ', u'they said always the human brain is waiting for the cannabis ', u'that which causes intoxication ', u'not waiting for it from outside ', u'it can generate from within', u'that is why there are receptors ', u'so this is something that we have always known ', u'i can show you  ', u'i m there always', u'but you look at my eyes ', u'i m always stoned', u'but as aware as anybody can be ', u'if you do not know intoxication in life', u'you will never know a sense of abandon ', u'if you don t have a sense of abandon', u'you will never walk full stride in your life ', u'you will only walk half steps all the time ', u'only when there is no fear of suffering', u'because you re highly intoxicated and fully aware', u'not because you consumed substances', u'which will take away your awareness ', u'simply because you re keeping the system ', u'the human mechanism at its highest function ', u'now it is fully self sufficient ', u'blissed out all the time ', u'now you will not think of all these things ', u'i m', u'i want you to look all young people ', u'i want you to look at this ', u'in your life would you like to do that which works', u'or that which does not work ', u'hmm ', u' multiple answers', u' human intelligence is always looking for that which works  isn t it ', u'that which does not work is not what we re interested in ', u'that which works ', u'when  i m  i m just wondering', u'how far to take you ', u'you look like a nice boy  ', u'this is', u'it is just this ', u'every experience ', u'whatever happens to you  ', u'right now let s look at it this way ', u'right now all of you ', u'those who are in the upper regions also ', u'do you see me ', u' yes ', u' even if you re not listening ', u'do you see me  ', u' yes ', u' if you see me', u'can you use one of your hands and point out where i am ', u'tch  tch  tch ', u'you also ', u'oh  you got it wrong ', u'you know i m a mystic ', u'from southern india  ', u'so today you know this light is falling upon me ', u'reflecting  going through your lenses ', u'inverted image in the retina ', u'you know the entire story  isn t it ', u'so you see me within yourself ', u'you hear me within yourself ', u'where have you seen the whole world ', u'within yourself ', u'the way it is projected in the firmament of your mind', u'you are not seeing the world it is ', u'you are saying it the way it s projected within you ', u'a grasshopper may not be seeing the world the way you see it ', u'he is seeing it differently ', u'yes or no ', u'same world but he sees  sees it differently', u'because his visual apparatus are made completely different ', u'you know that different animals hear ', u'some hear subsonic sound ', u'some hear ultrasonic sound ', u'we  we don t hear both of them ', u'yes ', u'we hear something else ', u'so we are all living in the same world', u'but seeing and hearing things completely differently ', u'what is day for us ', u'what is light for us is darkness for some other creature ', u'what is darkness for them is light for us ', u'obviously our instruments of perception', u'are created for our survival process', u'and their instruments for survival are crafted for their survival process', u'but now your intelligence has blossomed to a place', u'where survival is not good enough ', u'you want to know the nature of life ', u'once this longing comes', u'then you must understand', u'the instruments of perception need to be in enhanced ', u'these instruments', u'five senses of seeing  hearing  smelling  tasting and touching ', u'they are not good enough', u'because they are only instruments of survival ', u'they are not instruments of true knowing', u'because they show you everything in comparison ', u'when i say everything in comparison ', u'right now if you re six feet tall ', u'you stand like a tall man ', u'you walk like a tall man ', u'you think like a tall man ', u'you are a tall man ', u'you went to another society where everybody is eight feet tall ', u'suddenly you stand like a short man ', u'walk like a short man  think like a short man ', u'you are a short man  isn t it  ', u'i m saying what you know in comparison is only good for survival process not to know the nature of life ', u'so right now everything that you know is only by comparison ', u'if i touch this i feel it s cool ', u'no  that s not the reality ', u'the reality is because my body temperature is in a certain way', u'i make a judgment that this is cool ', u'suppose i lower my body temperature substantially', u'and then i touch this ', u'this would be warm to me ', u'yes or no ', u'so what you re perceiving is only by comparison ', u'what you know by comparison is just a distortion of reality ', u'it is good enough for survival ', u'it is not good enough to know the nature of life ', u'now you re talking about stress and anxiety', u'as i said', u'every year we ve been trekking in himalayas ', u'two years ago', u'i m in a tent somewhere in nepal', u'and i m doing some work ', u'someone else is cutting an apple  ', u'there s another person in the tent ', u'that person tells this person ', u' be careful  it s a very sharp knife ', u'it irritates me', u'because i call something a knife only if it s sharp ', u'what about you  ', u'i call something as knife only if it s really sharp otherwise', u'i will call it a screw driver  ', u'i look at this and then i continue my work ', u'and another two minutes', u'again it is said ', u' be careful  it s a very sharp knife ', u'i say  come on  leave the man alone ', u'if it s a child yes  but this is full grown man ', u'he knows how to handle a knife ', u'not a complicated machinery ', u' no  sadhguru  it s a very sharp knife   ', u'then i continued my work ', u'another two minutes i hear a whisper ', u' be careful  it s a very sharp knife   ', u'another two minutes he cuts his hand ', u'then i give up  ', u'why i m saying this to you is knife is not a sharp instrument ', u'a knife is not dangerous instrument ', u'every day in the world', u'both in terms of kitchens and operation theaters', u'tell me are knifves saving more lives or taking more lives ', u'saving more lives ', u'in an irresponsible hand it may take somebody s life ', u'knife is not dangerous ', u'it is in whose hands it is ', u'what kind of hand is it which makes it dangerous ', u'knife is not a dangerous instrument ', u'yes or no ', u'only if an unsteady hand is handling ', u'if a child holds a knife ', u'we say  be careful  be careful', u'because not because knife is dangerous', u'because the hand is not steady ', u'right now this is the situation ', u'compared to every other creature on the planet', u'your intellect is little sharper than them  ', u'would you like to have a sharp intellect or a dull one ', u' sharp ', u' sharp ', u'if you want a sharp intellect you must learn to hold it right otherwise', u'every day you start poking ', u'this is self help   you know ', u'when was the last time somebody stabbed you with a dagger in the ', u'when was the last time somebody stabbed you with a dagger  ', u'even in delhi it doesn t happen  ', u'maybe somebody poked you with a pin at the most when you were in school ', u'or maybe they ignored you ', u'they did not even do that  ', u'so what i m saying is', u'how much suffering is actually coming from outside ', u'miniscule  isn t it ', u'rest is all self help ', u'so once your intelligence turns against you ', u'believe me no force in the universe can save you ', u'so it s very important', u'before you do anything else in your life', u'you learn to bring your body and mind to a state', u'where your body take instructions from you ', u'your mind takes instructions from you ', u'they must serve you ', u'you should not be serving them ', u'otherwise you will live a very poor life ', u'very poor life', u'because you can only live a life of some significance', u'only when your mind and your body works for you', u'not against you  isn t it ', u'at least this much every human being should take charge of ', u' sadhguru  i speak to my friends around here', u'and whenever we talk about meditation or yoga ', u'they say   ah  that s for the old people ', u'that s not for us', u'and we re not very interested in it ', u'and one of my friends said ', u' i tried meditating and i slept ', u'so why is it that meditation and yoga is perceived', u'as something for the old and not for the young generation ', u' we don t need this ', u' maybe because', u'that is the kind of people they have met ', u'in the sense', u'yoga means they saw all yogis', u'who fell out of the calendars ', u'printed in shiva kashi  you know  in south india', u' ', u'all right ', u'they thought yoga means you re not interested in life ', u'that s a general thing ', u'i am doing everything possible to change this perception ', u'many things ', u'this is not for anything', u'because you re young people i m saying ', u'something physical you learn ', u'let s say you learn to ride a dirt bike ', u'let s say you learn to do sky diving ', u'let s say you learn to fly a helicopter ', u'let s say you learn to ski ', u'do something ', u'what you may take three years or five years to learn', u'i will do it in three months at this age ', u'would you like to do that at an early age', u'or when you re dying ', u'i m asking you ', u' early age ', u' then you must do yoga   ', u'i will tell you', u'i got into yoga for all the wrong reasons ', u'but that is the beauty of life ', u'even for wrong reasons if you do the right thing it works ', u'i was just eleven  twelve years of age ', u'every summer vacation', u'we go to our grandfather s ancestral home', u'where in the backyard there is a well', u'which is about eight feet in diameter ', u'about hundred and fifty feet in depth ', u'water generally in summer will be', u'at least sixty  seventy feet below the ground level ', u'so one of the sport for us young boys is to jump into this well and climb up ', u'when you jump you have to go properly', u'otherwise your brains will become a smear on the wall ', u'and to come up there is no step ', u'there is no foothold  nothing ', u'just holding the rock you have to climb ', u'i remember just the sheer pressure ', u'my weight', u'i was not very heavy', u'but still my weight on just two fingers and three fingers like this ', u'my nails would bleed out of sheer pressure not injury', u'just hanging onto the rock like that with claws ', u'but i would do that', u'and i m very proud that i m good at it ', u'one day a man who is over seventy years age', u'simply standing there silently watching us ', u'we ignored him', u'because seventy means for us he was dead  ', u'not now  okay  ', u'perspective of life will change  you know  ', u'at that time seventy means he s gone ', u'but without a word', u'this man who was over seventy two years of age at that time ', u'he just walked to the well and jumped ', u'i thought he s finished ', u'but he came up faster than me ', u'i didn t like it ', u'then i asked ', u'how ', u'he said   come  do yoga ', u'like a puppy i went behind him  ', u'because i found him so super human', u'that he could do things that no young man could do ', u'so i got into yoga for all the wrong reasons ', u'see it doesn t matter how you get in ', u'which door you enter from it doesn t matter', u'as long as you do the right thing it works ', u'essentially what yoga means is this', u'you use a cell phone ', u'what ', u'samsung ', u'iphone ', u' yes  a samsung  ', u' tch  you didn t use the seven  ', u'so if you have a cellphone', u'is it true or any gadget ', u'the more you know about it', u'the better you can use it ', u'is it so ', u'yes or no ', u'that s what your entire engineering is about ', u'to know more about everything', u'so that you can use it better  make it better  isn t it ', u'why is that not true with this ', u'the more you know about this ', u'the better you can use it ', u'anyway of all the', u'gadgets that you find on this planet', u'is this ', u'the most sophisticated mechanism on the planet ', u'do you agree with me ', u'if you don t agree with me then something wrong with you', u' ', u'this is the most sophisticated mechanism on the planet  isn t it ', u'why is it that you have not paid attention', u'as to see', u'what are all the intricacies of what this is ', u'what this means is', u'you haven t read the user s manual', u'but you want to blunder into the world ', u'so just education is becoming stress ', u'if you want to create something in the world', u'you will see so many more challenges ', u'so education which is a simplest process of all ', u'that is becoming stress ', u'this is simply because', u'you have not read the user s manual at all ', u'simply   samsung ', u'we don t know what ll happen ', u'you must learn how to use it ', u'similarly this  ', u'so if you know perfectly well how to use this', u'then we say you re self realized ', u'self realized does not mean you went to heaven ', u'you know this  perfectly well ', u'you know everything  the range of things this can do ', u'this is all i know in my life ', u'i know this piece of life from its origin to its ultimate ', u'people think i know everything ', u'that s their problem ', u'i know only this  ', u' so  there s a lot of talk about our country ', u'india these days ', u'even in the world platforms we see that the things are improving ', u'but going to the past of the india', u'if we see the history of world s civilizations', u'we see that india particularly stands out very clearly', u'when it comes to developing ways of', u'this self experiential ways of realizing this inner truth about ourselves', u'or knowing the body and the higher truths through self experiential ways ', u'so what do you think was it that', u'we were able to do properly that', u'we were able to discover these things', u'and not just that ', u'we were not just able to discover', u'but also proliferate them into the social eco system ', u'what was it that led us into this ', u' essentially a long spell of peaceful  civilized life  ', u'a long spell ', u'you must understand this ', u'the reason why we got this long spell is', u'in the north we were protected by the himalayan ranges ', u'in the south by the indian ocean ', u'so this is himalaya ', u'the indian ocean that we call today as the india ocean', u'at that time it was called as the indu sagara ', u'this is why we took the identity  hi  and  du  hindu ', u'hindu is not a religion ', u'not belief system ', u'not a god oriented thing ', u'it is a geographical identity ', u'unfortunately it s turned into many things today', u'that s a different thing ', u'so we identified with these two geographical features', u'because we realized', u'it s only because of these features that', u'we had an undisturbed civilization growing', u'without any external agencies coming and disturbing us ', u'when there is a long spell for a human being', u'where he doesn t have to fight for his survival on a daily basis ', u'that is when human genius flowers  ', u'in many ways human genius flowered ', u'we produced the greatest mathematician ', u'greatest astronomers ', u'greatest musicians ', u'all kinds of people', u'and many technologies which we refused to use', u'simply because we foresaw if you go this way what will happen to the world ', u'various other things ', u'if you look back at the glorious history of this country', u'it is simply because  ', u'which is true even today ', u'see you can build a great society', u'or a great nation', u'or a great world', u'not by talking about it ', u'only by building individual human beings', u'who are truly great ', u'without great human beings where is a great society ', u'society is just a word ', u'nation is just a word ', u'world is just a world ', u'individual human beings are the only reality ', u'what kind of people we are', u'that s the kind of india we have  isn t it  ', u'so the focus', u'right from ancient times in this country was always about individual development ', u'we never', u'see this is why the western commentators are missing the entire point ', u'they don t  they think india never had a civilization because', u'we never spoke about it ', u'we refused to speak about society  about nation ', u'we only spoke about individual development because', u'if you generate great individuals ', u'we will naturally have a great society ', u'a great society is a consequence ', u'it is not the cause ', u'the cause is great individuals ', u'so our focus was always on producing great human beings', u'never on producing a great society or a nation ', u'that happened as a consequence  ', u' so do you think from ancient times till now', u'do you think that things in india have changed ', u'so if they have', u'what brought us to the change we are in', u'and how do you see this development process of great individuals ', u'how do you see that being manifested in the modern times ', u' and if i may add how can these ideas  ', u'it s something that i m assuming that they are not so prevalent in', u' i m sorry  not ', u' i m assuming that these ideas of individual development focused on an individual', u'are not so prevalent in today s system', u' no  we ve gotten into mass production of everything  ', u' yes  so how we actually bring them back', u'and how should india then  ', u'if i ask a larger question  ', u'how should india as model of development ', u'is it just aping the west', u'or can we bring back those elements of individual development ', u' see  for anything to happen', u'you need a certain ecosystem ', u'certain economic  what to say ', u'a certain economic depth to  for people to be able to do it ', u'you must understand this ', u'the generation that we were growing up ', u'our parents were just crazy that', u'you must somehow get one degree and get into a government job ', u'your parents are not doing that ', u'they are thinking little more easy ', u'they are trying to explore things ', u'they want you to do a startup ', u'they want you to do a business ', u'they want you to get into sport ', u'this was never there ', u'they were just saying get a job somehow', u'otherwise you ll be on the street ', u'this was the level of economics of the time ', u'today there is a little more economic space', u'where parents are looking at their children little differently ', u'still we are little compressed in the heads', u'but little more ease than what it was forty  fifty years ago ', u'ask all your professors ', u'they were just pushed  pushed  get a job  get a job first thing ', u'today your parents are not looking like that ', u'looking at what can you create ', u'what can i  our children can create ', u'what can they live ', u'how about their happiness  ', u'nobody ever thought about our happiness  okay  ', u'so it needs a certain economic depth for any society', u'to experiment ', u'to have little more freedom to do things', u'otherwise putting them through the extruder', u'and getting them out in some form in which they re useful ', u'this is what the society will do ', u'this is a natural consequence of', u'fifteen  twenty generations of extreme poverty ', u'this is', u'this mental structure and this economic structure', u'is a consequence of fifteen to twenty generations of extreme poverty ', u'very bad poverty means', u'india has suffered poverty like nobody else ', u'people may show  you know  pictures of africa and stuff ', u'you must know this ', u'in africa there have been famines ', u'there have been wars ', u'unnecessary wars and tribal wars which have caused this in small scale ', u'in india the level of malnourishment and poverty', u'that s happened in the last two centuries is most painful ', u'no other nation on the planet has suffered as much as this country ', u'no other country has lost as many people', u'as we have lost in the last century just for hunger and lack of nourishment ', u'even today it is true', u'though we are much better ', u'even today unfortunately it is true', u'that we have the highest number of malnourished people in the country ', u'more than sixty percent of the rural population', u'even today ', u'they have not grown', u'their skeletal system has not grown to full size ', u'when they are in that state', u'you re only thinking how to make a living ', u'you re not thinking of how to open up human genius ', u'you re not interested in all that ', u'you re not thinking how to become self realized ', u'you re only thinking how to make a living ', u'so this has happened to us because we ve been an occupied nation for too long ', u'we ve been ripped off in every other way ', u'there s no point blaming somebody ', u'we didn t take care of it at that time ', u'it went out of our hands', u'but two hundred fifty  three hundred years ago everybody wanted to come to india ', u'why ', u'because it was the richest country on the planet ', u'we occupied a thirty three percent space', u'in the economic space of the planet at one time ', u'today probably we are two or three percent ', u'hmm ', u'so because of this extreme poverty', u'we have a certain mindset', u'but i think in a generation or in next fifteen  twenty years', u'a whole lot of people will come out of this', u'because there s little more ease ', u'little more space to play with ', u'little more space to push it ', u'so as a part of this', u'we are creating this space in many ways ', u'we have three types of education ', u'you know in isha ', u'we have what s called as isha vidya which is in rural india', u'which includes our own schools', u'which are mainly focused towards teaching english language  computer sciences ', u'regular academic education at a certain level ', u'bring discipline and well being  health and well being ', u'nourishment which is most important in the villages', u'and get them out of the village', u'because to get out of that economic and social pit in which they are', u'education is just a passport for them ', u'that s one level of education ', u'another level of education we have', u'what s called as isha home school ', u'this is for the little more affluent people ', u'this happens inside the yoga center itself ', u'we have a huge track of land and various facilities ', u'these schools are run in a certain way ', u'twenty children live with two dedicated house parents', u'and everything ', u'the school itself is inside the house ', u'that s why it s called a home school ', u'only for playground  laboratory and libraries they go out ', u'everything is inside the house ', u'this turns out expensive', u'an expensive way of delivering education', u'but this is done by dedicated people ', u'as a rule we never take any trained teachers ', u'we have doctors  engineers  accountants ', u'all kinds of people but no trained teachers because', u'we want education to happen as an inspiration', u'not as putting  you know ', u'shoving down information down somebody s throat ', u'as an inspiration', u'children should get the spark of wanting to know something ', u'there is a whole range of activity of theatre ', u'art ', u'music ', u'sport ', u'all kinds of things ', u'many of our  i mean', u'two  three of our boys are now in professional football in germany ', u'so like this they are going into various things ', u'this school gives an enormous range of things ', u'and i made this now ', u'eleventh  twelfth i made it three years ', u'not two years  three years i said one year extra', u'because by the time they got', u'get to eleventh a whole lot of parents will get marks mad ', u'we have invested so much time in music  theatre and many  many things ', u'now eleventh standard comes and everything is dropped', u'and they just start doing only  trying to get marks ', u'so i said three years ', u'if you want you stay otherwise no ', u'the surprising thing is nobody wants to withdraw their children ', u'this wouldn t have happened twenty five years ago ', u'everybody would have withdrawn their children ', u'now nobody wants to be ', u'not even one child wants to be withdrawn ', u'everybody wants to go three years for two years ', u'just as an experiment i announced this  ', u'everybody is taking to it ', u'the idea is  see  indians  wherever i go ', u'what i see is  they are in the best jobs ', u"they're earning well  they're highly qualified ", u"but they can't sing ", u"they can't dance ", u"they can't paint ", u"they can't do any damn thing except going to work ", u"really  this' an unfortunate thing  ", u"there's no life  ", u'so  i thought we must invest enough in the children', u'before they get into professional colleges ', u'we have to invest enough in their art  music  sport ', u'variety of interests ', u'they must explore many things ', u"there's another school which we call as isha samskriti ", u'here  if any child enters', u'compulsory they must stay with us  as a commitment  for twelve years ', u'only with that commitment we take the children ', u"here there's no academics ", u'they learn only yoga ', u'kalaripayattu  which is the mother of all martial arts ', u'have you seen kalaripayattu  kerala ', u'   ', u' yes ', u'kalaripayattu ', u'classical dance ', u'classical music ', u'samskrit language and english language ', u'this is all they learn ', u'you must see these children ', u"you won't believe ", u'they are a different set of human beings all together ', u'here  the focus is just this  ', u'developing human body and human brain to its fullest without a purpose ', u"i'm doing this because this is how i grew up ", u'i grew up without a purpose ', u'my father beat his head and say ', u' what will this boy do ', u"he's not getting qualified for anything ", u'so i would say   if i am not qualified for anything ', u'i can do just about everything   ', u'so   these children are growing up in such a way ', u'most amazing ', u"you won't believe it unless you see it ", u"i'm  just to tell you an experience ", u'from age of six to eighteen they are with us ', u'after that  if they wish  they can stay ', u'otherwise  they can go out and do what they want to do ', u'there are many things that they can do which we are supporting them to do ', u'from fifteen to eighteen they become monks for three years', u'  extreme discipline and focus ', u'very serious practices ', u'so before i initiate', u'this  compulsory they have to come out at eighteen ', u'we  they cannot choose to be monks ', u'they have to come out at eighteen', u'because this', u'we have allowed  we have made them go into it as children ', u'when they become adults  they must come out of it ', u'there is  they cannot choose to continue ', u'so  first batch i wanted to initiate ', u'now another is coming now in july  the third one ', u'the first batch  when i went to initiate about three years ago  ', u'sixty days ', u'fifteen year old children ', u'they have been on sixty days of silence ', u'30 in the evening ', u'they are in some kind of yogic sadhana ', u"minimum of eight hours they're keeping their eyes closed and sitting  okay ", u'just another four days are left for the initiation ', u'i want to see how these boys and girls are doing', u'  fourteen of them in the first batch ', u'30 ', u'i went and sat in the room ', u'these eight boys and six girls were sitting there  ', u"i'll never forget this in my life  ", u'they were just sitting there like that ', u'believe me ', u'they were literally glowing ', u'i sat there and wept', u"because i've never seen children like this in my life ", u'i was not like this when i was fifteen  for sure ', u'they are beyond anything that you can think of', u'simply because they are focused', u'in developing the human mechanism to its fullest ', u'not about how to earn my living ', u"this' not the question ", u'when a earthworm ', u'with one millionth of your brain can earn a living ', u'with such a big brain  earning a living ', u'is it such a big problem ', u'it is the most', u"it's the grossest way to approach life is  ", u'how will i earn my living ', u'everybody can earn their living ', u'the only problem comes in your life', u'when you want to live like somebody else ', u"that's a problem ", u'but earning a living is not a problem ', u'if you just make what is considered survival minimal ', u"don't go on exaggerating it ", u'then you will see you have a whole lot of time and opportunity', u'to create what you want in your life ', u'but people keep on raising the bar of survival', u'so much that they will not get to do anything in their life except surviving ', u"in the end  they don't know why they survived  ", u" so i think there's a lot of curiosity in the audience also building up ", u'so unless you have some general comments to make ', u'we can open the floor to the audience ', u" tch  you're all engineers", u"oh  they're disarming you  ", u'we must understand this  ', u'engineering means ', u'essentially  to make things happen the way we want it ', u"that's engineering  isn't it ", u'to engineer this building means what ', u'we want it the way we want it ', u'we could have sat under a tree ', u'but we choose to build this building because', u'we want to sit under something', u'engineered the way we want it ', u'as suitable for us ', u'we air conditioned the place', u'because we want the temperature in a certain way ', u'all this we did ', u'but it is not important that you engineer this ', u'the way you want it  hello ', u' yes ', u' outside is air conditioned ', u'inside is boiling  ', u"what's the point ", u" i'm saying power is being wasted on you  ", u'in the last hundred  hundred and fifty years', u'with the advent of science and technology  we have more comforts and conveniences than any generation', u"ever could imagine  isn't it ", u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u" i'm looking for a higher opinion again  ", u'you have more comforts and conveniences', u'than any generation could ever imagine ', u'we are the most comfortable generation ever ', u'physically  materially ', u'but can you say are you the most peaceful generation ', u'joyful ', u'loving ', u'no ', u"or can you even say you're the most intelligent generation ", u"that'll be a wrong thing to say ", u"anybody who claims he is intelligent amounts to foolishness  isn't it ", u'because the significance of intelligence is ', u'it shows you', u'how many loopholes are there in your intelligence ', u'only a fool thinks there are no loopholes ', u'a truly intelligent person always sees', u'how many loopholes in my intelligence ', u'the significance of being in a technological institute', u'is not about just getting qualified to get some job somewhere', u'or a passport out of the country ', u'it should become a way of creating life ', u"making life happen better than the way it's happening right now", u'because this is the fundamental responsibility that we have', u'as a generation of people', u'because we occupy this space on the planet for a short  brief time ', u'when the last generation gave this planet to us ', u'whichever way they gave it ', u"it's our business that when we leave it ", u'we leave it little better than the way we had it  ', u'very important ', u'how better ', u'in what way better ', u'you can decide that ', u"i won't say only ecologically better ", u'but in every way better ', u'it must be better than the way we got it ', u'this means we have to engineer ourselves', u'to fit in such a way', u'see  a well engineered machine means', u"least amount of friction  isn't it so ", u'yes ', u'a well engineered machine means what ', u'least amount of friction ', u"heavy friction means badly engineered  isn't it ", u"isn't that the understanding ", u'so the fundamentals of yoga is this  ', u'the fundamentals of yoga is', u'in the geometry of physical existence ', u'if you understand the geometry of what this human mechanism is ', u'the body is ', u'the psychological structure is ', u'the chemical processes are ', u'the energy structures are ', u'if you understand the geometry of this ', u'and become capable of observing the cosmic geometry ', u'if these two things are well aligned ', u'suddenly your life hits off like a magic ', u'your life is no more', u'a miserable drag ', u"but it's magical", u'simply because you have gotten the right geometry of things ', u'anything that is geometrically perfect', u'will function absolutely smoothly', u'and for a very long time ', u'this is something that you must do to yourself', u"when you're young ", u'it doesn t matter what you want to do in your life ', u'one thing must happen  ', u'your body and your brain should not come in your way ', u'they must work for you ', u'yes or no ', u'hello ', u' yes ', u' never your body and your mind should not come', u'in the way of who you want to be ', u'right now  for most people ', u'they themselves are a big issue ', u'when you are a issue ', u'how will you address the issues in the world ', u'if you really want to address the issues in the world ', u"this one  should never be a issue  isn't it ", u' i am not the issue here  i am never the problem ', u'if there are problems  i will deal with it ', u'but i am never the problem   ', u"this must happen to you  isn't it ", u'please

attitude in the country ', u'a whole lot of people ', u'for every solution they invent a problem  ', u'for every solution they have found a problem ', u'so there are people who are working for problems ', u'there are people who are working for solutions ', u'young people should stand up', u'and become a solution for future generations to come', u'and your own life to blossom ', u"because the greatest fulfillment in one's life is", u'that you functioned in such a way', u'that you could do something which is much larger than yourself ', u'this must happen ', u'this is the highest fulfillment of activity  ', u'that you are able to do something', u'which is larger than yourself ', u'only then ', u'you will see fulfilment in activity ', u'activity is one thing ', u'but most important thing is how you are ', u'people come to me right', u"right now you're all saying you're iit is the problem ", u"so i'm inviting you to iyc  ", u"it's isha yoga center  ", u'lot of people

dodging yourself', u'and one day you will explode into something ', u"you must know what is the level of madness you're suffering ", u'when i say madness  ', u'if your mind is out of your control ', u'is that called madness', u'in definition ', u'hello ', u' yes ', u' if your mind does not take instructions from you ', u"it's out of control ", u'is that called madness ', u' yes ', u' just try ', u'just today  after this event ', u'just go sit quietly in your room  ', u'just see', u'what all your mind does ', u'you  you decide ', u"don't tell anybody  ", u"you decide what is the level of madness you're going through ", u'with this  if you enter the world  what will you create ', u"you will only create who you are  isn't it ", u'you cannot do anything other than what you are ', u'what you are is what will happen to the world around you ', u'before you step out into the world ', u'is it not important  at least', u"you're this much equipped   that you are not the problem ", u"if you meet a problem and get married  we'll see", u' ', u'but you are not the problem  ', u'can you make this happen for yourself ', u'as young people  ', u'that you are never the problem ', u'hmm ', u'you are not the issue in your life ', u'other issues  if they come  we will deal with it', u'to the best of our ability ', u"but this  should not be a issue  isn't it ", u'this can be easily done   very simple processes ', u'if you invest one twenty   thirty minutes a day ', u'you can bring this possibility into your life ', u'it is just that it needs a certain orientation', u'because life is continuously outward ', u'to turn inward it needs a certain help', u'and situation has to be created to make that happen ', u'we are very much willing to do that with you ', u"it's my wish and my blessing this must happen", u'to every youth of this country', u'because india ', u'the people of india has suffered immensely ', u"i don't know to what extent all of you were exposed ", u'many of you

sadhguru', u' little closer  if you can  ', u' so what    dissolve    to you', u' all ', u'   ', u' all suffering to me  ', u' dissolve into you ', u' ooh ', u' i have read it in your book  so how can    dissolve ourselves into you ', u' i am not sulfuric acid  ', u"let's understand this  ", u'what is dissolution ', u"i don't know how you got this ", u'that is not what has been said anywhere ', u'but  little off  but let me correct that ', u'see  whether people are conscious of it', u'or not conscious of it ', u'every human being  knowingly or unknowingly ', u"are seeking solutions to wherever they are  isn't it so ", u'or in other words ', u'the nature of human intelligence is such', u'that wherever you are ', u'there is a problem  ', u'yes ', u'this happened', u"you  it's okay if i tell you a joke  hmm ", u"i know it's a serious question ", u'very spiritual  ', u'a husband and wife who were over seventy years of age ', u'were celebrating their forty fifth wedding anniversary ', u'tch ', u'so they decided', u'they will go through everything', u'just the way it happened on the wedding day ', u'so  wedding got over ', u'they went to the church where they got married ', u'they came out of it at the same time ', u'then  as they did on that day ', u'they went to a romantic italian movie ', u'then after that ', u'they went for a dinner in a particular restaurant ', u'they had the same kind of food and the same kind of wine', u'and they started driving ', u'then the wife said ', u" john  what's happened with you ", u'do you remember forty five years ago', u'when we were driving ', u'how passionately you kissed me ', u'so he said   okay   ', u'hey  don t laugh ', u"you don't know what is forty five years later  ", u"that's a different world  okay  ", u'so  he tried to kiss her', u'and unfortunately forty five years later', u'your body is not the same', u'and the cars are faster ', u'and boom they went into the bridge ', u'so  they were at the gates of heaven  ', u'then they got checked in together  ', u'and because both of them were golfers ', u'they asked ', u' is there a golf course in heaven ', u'saint peter said ', u' yes  the best  the best golf course you would have ever seen ', u' so  can we see ', u'he said  fine ', u'they saw it was an immaculate course ', u'they asked ', u' can we tee off ', u'is there a tee time ', u'anytime is tee time in heaven ', u'day or night ', u'so', u" but we don't have our clubs ", u' no problem  just for you  fitted for you ', u'golden clubs ', u'so  the man teed off  splitting the fairway ', u'straight and long ', u'tch ', u"the lady walked up to the lady  lady's tee and teed off ", u'again  straight ', u'then they were walking towards the ball for the second shot ', u'suddenly the husband became depressed ', u'as it usually  many times happens to the husbands  ', u'she looked at him and said ', u" john  what's the problem ", u'we are in heaven ', u'we are on the best golf course ', u'you had a great shot ', u'i had a great shot ', u'why are you so depressed ', u'he said ', u' if it was not for your stupid health food ', u'we could have come here long time ago   ', u'so  this is the nature of human intellect  ', u'because it gets only one face of everything ', u'it is always thinking some', u'everything is a problem ', u"when you don't have a problem ", u"you're dissolved ", u'please see this ', u"because you are not a problem  you're a possibility  ", u'when people', u'most people', u'most people  when they utter the word human ', u'they say   oh  i am only a human ', u"they're always referring to the word human", u'as a limitation ', u'as a problem ', u'very few people are saying   i am human ', u'referring to the immensity of being human', u'because most people have not explored', u'the immensity of what it means to be human ', u'this is why there is so much talk about', u'heaven and god and so many things  ', u'because people have failed to explore', u'the immensity of what it means to be human ', u'if you explore the full depth and dimension', u'of what it means to be human ', u"then you don't worry about dissolution", u'because is it true', u'is it true that you were not born this way ', u'of this size  as you are today ', u'hello ', u' yes ', u' slowly you accumulated ', u'how ', u"just the food that you've eaten  isn't it ", u'what you accumulate can be yours ', u"you cannot say it's me  isn't it ", u'hello ', u"as i'm speaking ", u'i pick up this vessel and say ', u' this is my vessel ', u'then you will think ', u' oh  sadhguru has some problem  ', u"but everybody says he's wise  let us listen some more ", u'after some time i say ', u' this is me  then you will say ', u" let's go  ", u"because now it's dangerous  isn't it  ", u"but this you're doing every day  ", u'food appears on your plate ', u'you say   this is my food ', u'you eat it and then you say   this is me ', u'you', u'if you get this point today ', u'that the body that you carry is just a piece of the planet', u'  today if you get it experientially ', u'your life will chance today ', u'otherwise  one day you will anyway get it from the maggots ', u"but it's a bit late  you know ", u'so dissolution does not mean destruction ', u'dissolution means you broke the boundaries of your individuality', u'because your individual existence is a myth that you have created ', u'you are very much individual ', u"you don't like the person who is sitting next to you right now ", u"so don't breathe the air that they are breathing ", u'do one thing ', u'just close your nose like this  ', u'hold it like this  for two minutes ', u"you know that without communication you won't last for a moment ", u'this is not just with respiration ', u'this is with every particle in this body ', u'without being in communication with the entire existence ', u'this  cannot exist for a moment ', u'so dissolution is not something that you have to do ', u'if you drop the conclusions that you have made about yourself ', u'this is already dissolved ', u"modern physics is telling you this  isn't it ", u'you already dissolved ', u"you don't have to dissolve ", u'it is just that you have a fancy idea in your head ', u'to get that idea out is the spiritual process ', u'spiritual process is not a real process ', u'spiritual process is just helping you', u'to distance yourself', u'from your physiological and psychological process', u'so that you see life just the way it is  ', u' sadhguru ', u' where are you ', u' here  ', u' okay ', u' so  i completely resonate with the idea of yours', u'which you have in education', u'and having graduated from this place ', u"and i don't know why i did engineering ", u'one year of preparation ', u'four years of b  tech ', u'two years of m  tech ', u"out of that frustration of why i'm doing engineering ", u'i wanted to work in the education sector ', u'and currently i am working ', u'i feel', u'i face many challenges ', u'to bring about a change in the system of how things are working', u'and how children are taught ', u'it takes very', u'it is a very slow process of how things move', u'and how much you try that ', u'okay  there should be a holistic development and this and that ', u'things boil down to  okay ', u'fall at feet and do this and do that', u'though  i want to ask you  if you', u'if you can give some tips on how your', u'how you think of how education should be  ', u'can be actually scaled up ', u'there are so many models', u'which are there in some parts of the country', u'which believe in this ', u'and i too feel  kee  ', u'mediation can be introduced in the system of education ', u'so  what do you feel kee  ', u'how can we make this happen at a large level ', u' please  ', u'see  we are always thinking of changing the system ', u'i am not saying it should not  it should ', u'but within the existing systems we can do many things ', u'depending upon the individual teachers and individual educators ', u'how they operate ', u'because when you try to change the system in your own time ', u'when you want to change the system ', u'you must understand', u'any system ', u'even within the family if you want to change a system ', u'it will take many years ', u"it's not going to change overnight ", u'sometimes a generation has to pass as', u'for it to change ', u'to walk into a house with your shoes on ', u"one generation has to pass   isn't it ", u'so ', u'instead of thinking how to change the system  ', u'yes ', u'we must have the vision of changing the system ', u'but within the system ', u'how to do the maximum delivery', u'is something that all of us should always look at ', u'otherwise  we are always talking about future generations', u'without addressing the current generations ', u"it'll never work that way ", u"it'll only be a dream ", u'we have to make the difference in the current generation ', u'only then  if you take a small step now ', u'the next generation will take a bigger step ', u'but without taking this step ', u'we are dreaming of a big step ', u'it will not happen ', u'it will be just an idea which will not work ', u'so  as an educator  ', u'you mentioned the word meditation ', u'we must understand this  what meditation means ', u'the word meditation ', u"the english word meditation doesn't mean anything ", u'if somebody sits with their eyes closed ', u'people think they are meditating ', u'but you can sit with your eyes closed for many reasons ', u'unable to bear the world ', u'you can close your eyes  ', u'yes ', u'you may be', u'in yoga there is many things  ', u'you may be doing', u'japa  tapa  dharana  dhyana  samadhi  shoonya  samyama  ', u"we don't know what you're doing ", u'so there is', u'the word meditation is not specific ', u'it is too general', u"and it's not saying anything in particular ", u'let us say if we are thinking to align the word meditation', u'with what we refer to as dhyan ', u'or dhyana ', u'or dhayanam as you go south ', u'because hindi speaking people ', u'you have a way of clipping away the words in the end ', u'hmm ', u'we say rama  you say ram ', u'we say dhyanam you said dhyan  tch ', u"you're cutting off everything in the end ", u"that's your option ", u"but if you're thinking it is dhyan  or dhyana  or whatever ", u'what this means is ', u'if you sit here', u'if you sit here ', u'if you clear', u'if you have a distinct experience', u'that your body is here  ', u'you mind is somewhere else ', u'what is you is elsewhere ', u'or in other words  there is a little space', u'between what is you and what is your body ', u'what is you and what is the content of your mind ', u'suppose this little space was achieved within you right now ', u'would all these young boys be complaining about stress ', u'you must do one thing  ', u'if you were an aviator you would know this  ', u"you're driving to the airport ", u'traffic jam  traffic jam  traffic jam ', u'ouhh  you curse everybody', u'and honk and do all this and get there ', u'then you fly ', u"then you're flying over the traffic jam ", u'it all looks very nice  you know  ', u'simply because of the distance  ', u'when you were in it ', u'it was a terrible thing ', u"once you're flying above it  it looks quite nice actually ", u'traffic jams  ', u'once there is a little distance ', u"that's the end of suffering ", u'so if they', u'if you create a little space between you and your body ', u'between you and your mind ', u'this is the end of suffering', u'because there are only two kinds of sufferings in your life  ', u'physical suffering  mental suffering ', u'do you know any other kind of suffering ', u'hmm ', u'only two sufferings ', u"if you distance yourself a little bit  that's all ", u'distancing is not by attitude ', u'anyway these are accumulations ', u'you gathered this body ', u'you gathered this mind ', u'if you keep what belongs to you one way ', u'and what is you in another way ', u"it's taken care of ", u'so  we can teach you a simple method', u'with which you can do this  ', u'very  very simple process ', u'every human being is capable of this ', u"let's understand this  ", u'when it comes to external realities ', u'all of us are differently capable ', u'no two human beings are equally capable ', u'when it comes to inner possibilities ', u'all of us are equally capable ', u'no human being has come better endowed than the other ', u'it is just that', u'most human beings never look in that direction  ', u' namaste sadhguru  mein  i m here ', u'my name is kamal ', u'i m here with my wife  my mother', u'and thank you so much for coming here ', u'we have been following your guidance for many years now', u'and it inspired us to ', u'you mentioned about iyc ', u'it inspired us to create yic or young india challenge', u'where two days back we invited the youth of india from erode ', u'bangalore  assam to solve india s challenges', u'and i would like to ask you is that', u'the way we re connecting this is that', u'if people find their passion and do what they love ', u'they should be able to positively contribute to the society', u'and solve the biggest challenge ', u'but we see that there are so many practical situations', u'that young people face', u'and today we re talking about youth and truth ', u'how can we do this more', u'and wake up more and more young people', u'that not only they follow their passion', u'but they must connect it to nation building', u'and solving the biggest challenges of our time ', u'especially the youth here which is as you said  privileged', u'and has house  shelter and the basics are covered ', u'how can we make it more experiential ', u'that it becomes a movement', u'that young people not only do what they love', u'but also make a positive impact ', u'how can we do this more and get a large number of young people', u'to get into this conversation ', u' you are the young man ', u'i m willing to speak to any young people or old people ', u'i ', u"i don't see youth as a numerical entity ", u'i think lot of young people are pretty old  ', u'complaining about stress  ', u'being young or old is not just of age ', u'not the question of your birthday ', u'when you were born ', u'have you ', u'are you an exuberant life', u'or have you become  ', u'youth means life in the making ', u'all possibilities wide open ', u'that s what youth means ', u'you ve not become conceited yet ', u'you should not be  i m saying  ', u'you ve not made your conclusions about life ', u'you re still willing to look at everything fresh ', u'that s what youth means ', u'i think it s the business of every human being to stay that way all their life', u'that you never make your conclusions ', u'you become a constant exploration', u'and a seeking in life ', u'that you ve not become a conclusion ', u'conclusion should happen with death ', u'before that if you conclude ', u'then we will have to endure dead people walking around in the society', u'who have no zest for anything but we have to bear with them  ', u'that should not happen to you or to anybody  isn t it ', u'so  you said many things in one question ', u'about nation building ', u'about many things ', u'yes ', u'in seventy years we should have built the nation', u'but we have made some grave mistakes', u'for which we are paying the price', u'but there s no point doing postmortem', u'and going on thinking what we could have done right at that time ', u'we should do the right things now', u'and as a ', u'as a nation ', u'as a culture ', u'i must tell you this ', u'i speak to variety of people ', u'to the highest level of academics ', u'scientists ', u'various parts of the world ', u'but i still find ', u'if you take a bunch of people ', u'just like that if you catch them ', u'one hundred people on the street in mumbai or bangalore or chennai ', u'they re much smarter than anybody you can find anywhere ', u'really ', u'no  i ', u'i didn t mean to leave out delhi  ', u'i m saying average intelligence in this country ', u'average intellect in this country is naturally high', u'because of a certain cultural ethos', u'that we ve had for a long time ', u'but our problem is ', u'there human intelligence is organized to produce something ', u'here human intelligence is disorganized ', u'everybody is a genius but nothing happens ', u'you go and sit in a tea shop ', u'he will be telling you how virat kohli ', u'you know his bat is ', u'he s not holding it right ', u'tch what he should do ', u'the tea shop owner ', u'he will also say how narendra modi does not know this  this  this', u'how he should have done this ', u'how he should have done that ', u'only problem is  he does not know how to make good tea', u' ', u'we must transit from this ', u'we must be a conscious application of genius ', u'not a wild application of genius ', u'it will not produce any results ', u'it will only create problems ', u'it s very important that we organize india', u'to a productive future', u'otherwise we ll work against each other constantly ', u'see  we re driving against each other ', u'all of us could easily drive ', u'with the roads that we have ', u'for the traffic that we have  we could easily drive well ', u'we could easily come  come up with something  ', u'okay  everybody must drive minimum sixty kilometers per hours ', u'because there are some very fast drivers ', u'some slow drivers ', u'some who don t know what is driving ', u'some who thinks they are formula 1 racers ', u'all kinds of people are there on the same street ', u'you know  this i realized about twenty years ago or more here ', u'about twenty years ago  when i first went to united states ', u'i m always used to putting my right foot down ', u'full on ', u'so i m hitting like hundred and fifty miles per hour ', u'people say ', u' sadhguru don t do this  they will handcuff you ', u'i said ', u' why  the road is wide open ', u'the engine is good  what s my problem ', u'and i m okay ', u'they said ', u' no  sadhguru  that s not the thing ', u'see here they put seventy ', u'you have to go seventy only ', u'it took me some time to understand ', u'then i looked around  then i see a eighty two year old woman is driving a school bus ', u'then i saw ', u' okay  i can drive at any speed and keep the car on the road ', u'but now this lady who s eighty two is driving a school bus ', u'maybe if i go bhooom like this next to her ', u'we don t what happens to her ', u'then it took me a year to take this passion of putting my right foot down ', u'now i m little controlled', u'and just above the speed limit i am  ', u'because i started appreciating the organization ', u'it kind of ', u'for an indian mind it s a little difficult', u'because what i can do ', u'i can do', u'but what about the rest of the organization ', u'the organization has been done so that everybody can participate in it ', u'i may be good at something so i will do it in a certain way ', u'if i want to do that  i must go on a racetrack  you know ', u'i really want to hit two hundred miles per hour ', u'i must go on a racetrack  not on the road ', u'because the road is made for everybody ', u'all kinds of people are driving', u'and most people don t have help', u'even though they re eighty five  ninety ', u'there are ninety year olds driving ', u"you can't drive at hundred miles per hour next to him ", u'but we can easily set this up ', u'i m just taking road as an example ', u'with every aspect of our life ', u'i think india what it lacks is', u'too much genius and not enough organization ', u'you young people must bring that organization into this country', u'so that this intellectual investment', u'or intellectual you know  the bank that we have ', u'the human resource that we have can become a great potential ', u'not a huge problem ', u'it can become a big problem if it is not organized  ', u' so we re running a little short of time ', u'it s gonna be the last question we ll be taking ', u'please  microphone  take the microphone ', u' no  i don t need one    ', u'there is so much effort and struggle to change', u'and design human mind when we are on the    ', u'is there any way to design that    ', u' you must use the microphone  ', u'microphone is not your requirement ', u'it s my requirement  ', u' thank you  madam ', u'i said there is so much effort and struggle', u'to design and shape human mind', u'when we are out of womb ', u'is there any way you know sir', u'to design human mind when we are inside womb ', u'that s my question ', u' at home  is that what you are asking ', u' inside womb ', u' oh  whoa  whoa  whoa  ', u'who is pregnant  ', u'now if you do not know this ', u'maybe in northern part of the country', u'it s largely almost gone totally ', u'in south it s still little alive in the villages', u'but they re also it s wiped out quite a bit ', u'if you do not know this', u'from preconception to conception', u'to various stages of pregnancy and delivery', u'and as long as the mother is feeding the child', u'there s an entire established process in this country', u'as to how a woman should eat ', u'what she should do ', u'whose kind', u'what kind of people she should interact with ', u'what kind of form she should look at ', u'what kind of form she should not look at ', u'what kind of sounds she should hear ', u'what kind of sound she should not hear ', u'all this was very much there ', u'but we must also understand life has changed ', u'today women are going to work ', u'they have to get into that horrible bus', u'where they re pushed around', u'it doesn t matter she is pregnant', u'and all kinds of things  ', u'all kinds of fumes ', u'all kinds of sounds ', u'all kinds of noises ', u'all kinds of abuse ', u'every kind of thing happening to her ', u'in some way we are doing that to the child also ', u'there is no job in the country', u'or in the world where', u'you can take off for one and a half years and get back to the job', u'to fulfill this ', u'in one way because of various things  ', u'this is ', u'i m not passing a judgment on this', u'but for various reasons', u'we are not taking', u'the business of manufacturing the next generation of people', u'with sufficient care ', u'tch  we are not paying enough attention to it', u'for which we ll pay a price ', u'over a period of time we will pay an immense price for that ', u'but we are definitely not taking enough care about it', u'in the entire world not just in this country', u'because we ve got all kinds of social situations', u'which does not allow that space for a woman to dedicate that kind of time and attention ', u'see  being pregnant is not just about reproduction ', u'we literally manufacturing the next generation of people  isn t it ', u'is it not important of all the products that you produce on this planet ', u'is it not most important that we produce wonderful

already do not know this ', u'if a woman delivers a male child ', u'the quality of the milk that she produces is in a certain way ', u'if she delivers a female child', u'the quality of the milk is

produce human beings for the future who are of a certain kind ', u'so how to develop the brain when they re in the womb ', u'it s very important that', u'the atmosphere in which the child is growing up in a certain way', u'with the least amount of disturbance ', u'with right kind of reverberations ', u'right kind of sounds ', u'right kind of food  everything ', u'today they re barely nourished

', u'every home ', u'if possible every working place ', u'we can have a consecrated space ', u'today slowly they are coming up with instruments', u'which can measure the reverberations of certain

of ', u'some amount of respite can be there for there', u'for that new life which is blossoming within the womb ', u'please  ', u' sir  by reading ancient scriptures', u'like bhagwat gita or guru grand saheb', u'we tend to become very much pure ', u'we look the world from a different perspective ', u' what  what is that ', u'you become pure ', u' a person becomes pure ', u' but why were they impure  ', u'no ', u'why were they impure ', u' because sometimes people are very much unkind ', u' un ', u' unkind ', u' unkind  oh ', u' so we look at the world in a different way ', u'we become very much kind', u'and we develop the tendency of forgiving people', u'but what happens when we go to the work place', u'we realize that', u'because of your this attitude ', u'because you become very much kind', u'and you have the tendency to forgive people', u'the other people they start using you ', u'so what should we do ', u'what a person should do in such cases ', u'should a person stop reading such ancient scriptures like bhagwat gita  guru grant saheb', u'or what is the right age to read such books  ', u' now  one thing  the last part of the question that you said ', u'other people will start using you ', u'that means you re not using yourself well ', u'that there is space and time that others can use you ', u'if you re using yourself to the fullest extent', u'nobody will have an opportunity to use you  ', u'see ', u'if your', u'let us say you re using something', u'twenty four hours of the day ', u'where will i get the time to use the same thing ', u'so twenty four hours

this ', u'it s good somebody else is using it  ', u'now', u'anyway bhagwat gita is not about kindness ', u'krishna is talking about war  ', u'he s a very practical person ', u'where there is war needed ', u'he is trying to instigate war ', u'he sees there is no other solution', u'so he is saying let s go to war ', u'somebody else is hesitating ', u'he says  this is it ', u'this is the time to fight ', u'this is not the time to hesitate ', u'where is kindness in this ', u'very simple political sense ', u'what needs to be done is being done ', u'he is only saying don t get caught up in this activity ', u'you need to do it  just do it ', u'don t make too much fuss about it ', u'kindness  tch', u'see ', u'kindness means', u'kindness is useful only for the fallen  isn t it ', u'when you re standing on your feet', u'do you want somebody to be kind to you ', u'hello ', u'let us say you were going to your friend s house every day ', u'they welcomed you and everything ', u'they fed you', u'and took care of you', u'but one day you realized', u'they were doing it simply because they were kind to you ', u'tch  will you feel insulted or no ', u'yes or no ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' only when you re fallen kindness matters ', u'when you re standing on your feet', u'you don t want kindness ', u'you want acceptance ', u'you want respect  you want', u'yes or no ', u'so kindness is only for the sick and the dying', u'not for young ', u'you should not ask for kindness ever ', u'do you want to pass because your professor is kind to you', u'', u'do you', u'do you want to get a job because somebody is kind to you', u'or because out of your competence you want to get the job ', u'which way is it ', u'do not seek anything in this life out of kindness ', u'that will happen when you re in your death bed ', u'when you can t do anything for yourself ', u'then you expect some kindness ', u'that also', u'if you re very capable', u'you can handle that also ', u'you can walk to your grave and die ', u'i can teach you that technology also  ', u'yes ', u'that as you live consciously', u'you can also die consciously ', u'it is possible for a human being to do this ', u'a whole lot of creatures do this  do you know ', u'do you know', u'when a cobra wants to die', u'it  it finds a place somewhere', u'usually on top of a tree ', u'one branch where nobody can reach', u'and just sits there for over twelve for fifteen days', u'without eating and it ll die there ', u'when i first noticed this i didn t figure this ', u'i thought why is this cobra become so skinny ', u'i brought it home', u'and i pour milk into his mouth', u'and i tried to make him eat', u'and then i leave him ', u'he again goes up the tree and sits there ', u'three  four times i bring him down ', u'again he goes up there and sits there', u'and after five days he s dead ', u'so when a crawly creature like a snake', u'has this much awareness', u'that life is coming to an end and he wants to die in a

u'i have seen some dvds ', u'i have read your books ', u'and everywhere there are your brilliant views on various issues ', u'it could be from the making of a nation', u'to the making of a toy car ', u'from the running of a household to the running of parliament ', u'you have brilliant views on every issue that one can ever question ', u'yet i know very little about you', u'and it', u'you know here s a brilliant mind with an  for lack of better words ', u'i would say  out of the box  thinking  ', u'so different ', u'so refreshing ', u'so enlightening ', u'i am fascinated and i want to know about your life ', u'and i d like to know that', u'i mean ', u'were you just born brilliant ', u'did it begin from that very moment ', u' i was a normal birth ', u'i didn t come in a box  ', u'my mother had a normal child ', u' no  you know ', u'i m from the movies and i can t help thinking  ', u'was it like it is in story books ', u'that a venerable sage came to your home', u'and when he looked at your mother ', u'he said  ', u' there is going to be born a guru  rejoice ', u'he will lighten his own path and that of others ', u' you also  you also going like this  ', u' no  but was it like that or how was it ', u'how was your childhood ', u' i don t think they all came to listen to my mother s labor pains  ', u' no  i m really fascinated ', u'intrigued that we re all here', u'but you know  the way you think ', u'we wait to hear what you have to say ', u'we ve all been little children', u'and we ve all grown up', u'but we ve grown up and been educated in schools and', u'but i find our way of thinking ', u'our way of being very conditioned ', u'like almost systematized ', u'whereas ', u'so where  where did it all begin ', u' i think you re looking for something unnatural that happened there  ', u'one thing that could be considered unnatural was', u'it seems i was a very delayed birth ', u'my mother went to the hospital three times and came back', u'and she gave up that he s not coming  ', u'and when it actually happened  it happened at home ', u'my father being a physician  that was not possible ', u'she  she had to be in the hospital ', u'three times she went and three times it didn t happen ', u'they did everything possible and she gave up ', u'so it happened at home ', u'so  that s the only reasonably unnatural thing ', u'everything else was natural   birth ', u'i didn t come in a box  ', u'and i refused to be educated  ', u'so  what is', u'i mean the question that you re asking is ', u'do people grow up and blossom', u'or are they brought up by somebody ', u'you will see the general expression is ', u' i was brought up in this place ', u'i was brought up in that way ', u'especially in the west  you will see ', u' i was brought up christian ', u' i was brought up jewish ', u'these are very common words ', u'i think it s absolutely ridiculous and humiliating', u'that a human being has to be brought up ', u'you bring up cattle  okay ', u'you don t bring up a human being ', u'a human being is supposed to blossom by his own nature ', u'that is why he s on the top of the pile ', u'at least on this planet  in the evolutionary scale ', u'and most human beings don t seem to understand that', u'or they are not allowed to understand that by a whole lot of people', u'and they need to be brought up ', u'bringing up means somebody is molding you ', u'molding means it s a predetermined shape ', u'and no flower that blossoms is the same way as another one ', u'which blossomed yesterday ', u'but a mold means it s always going to be the same ', u'if you make a mold ', u'the idea of making a mold is that we want to have the same form ', u'again and again and again ', u'right now  generally that seems to be the work', u'unfortunately of the current education system ', u'the so called religions that are operating in the world', u'and of course the family ', u'they want you to be in a certain mold ', u'they don t want you to blossom like a wild flower', u'because they re afraid of anything fresh happening among them ', u'they want something that is familiar ', u'they don t want something unfamiliar to be born among them ', u'so  if you have succumbed to that system ', u'then yes  you ve been molded into a certain form ', u'if you allow your humanity to blossom ', u'then you will see  you don t belong to any mold ', u'this is the beauty of being human that there is no a particular way to be ', u'if you were a dog you would be one way ', u'if you were cattle you would be one way ', u'if you were a sheep you would be another way ', u'if you re bird   another way  a grasshopper   another way ', u'but to be human means there is no particular way ', u'what is human is not defined  nor described ', u'it is  it is just that', u'for every other creature on this planet ', u'nature drew two lines ', u'within that they have to play their game ', u'for a human being  only the bottom line is drawn ', u'there is no top line ', u'but socially  people are trying to draw a top line for themselves ', u'but nature has not drawn a top line for you ', u'it s a limitless possibility', u'and this is what is freaking human beings right now ', u'because they can t decide what they can   need to be ', u'they re trying to be like somebody else ', u'only bottom line is set  top line has been removed', u'this is evolution ', u' but wait  we still didn t quite get to', u'so how was it when you were a child ', u'were you  were you put into a school to go the systematic way', u'and did you keep up with it', u' do i  do i look that edu  educated ', u'don t insult me like that  ', u'actually you know  when i go and stand in the line', u'in the immigration lines  in particularly in america ', u'they look at me and say   can you speak english ', u'i say  ', u'because i have that uneducated look  it s not easy  ', u'do you know', u'do you know what it takes to remain uneducated ', u'education is just twenty years of going somewhere and getting one certificate ', u'to remain uneducated  it s very difficult', u'because from the day you re born ', u'your parents  every other adult  the school  the damn thing', u'everybody is trying to educate you', u' yes ', u'  about something that s not worked in their life  ', u' and then did you also  like we all went through these confused teenage years', u'of not really knowing where we re going ', u'i mean did you clearly know your path ', u' not at all ', u'i was  right from three or four years of age ', u'i was always a million questions hanging in  in my head ', u'i have a question about everything  ', u'everything to everything ', u'questions means  very fundamental questions about existence itself ', u'my own existence ', u'so  when i was three  four years of age ', u'suddenly i realized i know nothing ', u'know nothing means  ', u'somebody gives me a glass of water  i do not know what is water ', u'i know how to use it  i know if i drink it ', u'it will quench my thirst and so many other ways of using it', u'but i do not know what is water ', u'i m saying even today  you do not know what is water ', u'it s the only thing available in all three states on the planet ', u'three  two thirds of the planet is water ', u'two thirds of your body is water ', u'if we think life  we think water ', u'but do you know what it is ', u'with all the scientific exploration ', u'we do not even know a single atom in its entirety ', u'today  our idea of science is ', u'learning how to use everything ', u'yes ', u'we know how to use an atom ', u'we know how to break it ', u'we know how to fuse it', u'but we really do not know what it is ', u'any one thing  tiniest thing in the creation ', u'we do not know in its entirety ', u'this is the fact of life ', u' well even something simple as what you started with ', u'saying that looking at water ', u'i mean  straight away i was taught water   h2o', u'and what it can do and it', u'you can mix it with colors and it becomes that ', u'you can drink it and it quenches your thirst ', u'but i never looked at it and said you know ', u' i don t really know what is water ', u' because nobody looks at anything ', u'see  everybody is looking like this ', u'nobody has any attention for a piece of life here ', u'they re like this  ', u'if you pay attention to one life ', u'one blade of grass ', u'one grasshopper ', u'one human being ', u'something else will happen ', u'that s why we said  life and love ', u'because if you pay attention to one human being ', u'some love will happen within you  okay ', u'if you miss life  at least some emotion in that direction must happen to you ', u'that will happen only if you pay attention to one ', u'if you re looking at like this ', u'these days it s become a fashion because you re in love on facebook ', u'you love the whole humanity ', u'to love one human being', u'if you want to love one human being  it costs life ', u'to love the whole humanity  it doesn t cost anything ', u'it s even better to love god', u'because it s always easy to love somebody who is not here now  ', u'it s so easy ', u'but if you have to love somebody who is sitting next to you right now ', u'it costs life ', u'you know how difficult it is to love someone who is next to you right now ', u'how easy it is to love someone who is dead or who is in heaven ', u'isn t it so ', u'let s face it ', u'because if you have to love one ', u'one thing is you have to pay attention ', u'without attention  it will not happen ', u'and above all  you have to give up something that is you ', u'to accommodate another ', u'otherwise it will not happen ', u'the english expression  it s very good  ', u' you must fall in love ', u'you cannot rise in love ', u'you cannot stand in love ', u'you cannot fly in love ', u'you have to fall ', u'something of you should fall  otherwise it will not work ', u'you will not know it ', u'so  you want to have a fake sense of life ', u'then you don t pay attention to anything ', u'everything is information ', u'nothing is a living experience ', u'everything is from the textbook or from the cinema or from the internet ', u'nothing is from life s experience ', u'you re doing more and more today of that ', u' sadhguruji  you just mentioned love', u'and today it is about  life and love  and i would like to know ', u'for us it is maybe love your family members ', u'whoever it could be  i  i', u'why i ask you this is because there re so many versions of this', u'and i really want to get to it ', u'some teachers ', u'some gurus ', u'some guides will say you know ', u' you can love but you must be detached ', u' ohoho ', u'  you must love but it cannot be conditional ', u'it should be unconditional and', u'so  there s versions of it ', u'i just want to know ', u'so have you ', u' see  the simple  the simple way of make you keep coming back to me is', u'to give you something that you cannot do ', u'to give you a teaching which you can never do ', u'you must love  but you must be detached  ', u'now you have to keep coming back to me for consultation  ', u'endlessly ', u'  sorry ', u' i m saying throw yourself into your love affair and die into it ', u'something will happen ', u'something worthwhile will happen if you re willing to die into the process ', u'not just anything  ', u'whether it s your work or your life or your love or whatever ', u'if you do not know how to throw your entire self into it ', u'you will never know the taste of what it is ', u' love  but be detached ', u'what  why do you want to love then  ', u'only because you want to include somebody as a part of your life', u'part of yourself  that s why you love ', u' no  i love but i  i m detached ', u'this means you have to come back to consultation  every day ', u'it is like a psychiatrist s job', u'everyday you have to come and sit on the couch ', u'you need treatment and there is a fee  ', u' so  okay all right ', u'so you can love and be attached', u' no  no  i didn t say that ', u' okay  i m coming back for consultation  please  ', u'so  what did you say ', u' i only said ', u'see what is this need for love in a human being ', u'you must understand ', u'a human being constantly ', u'constantly ', u'a human being is longing to be something more than what they are right now ', u'if this finds a simple basic physical expression ', u'we call this sexuality ', u'sexuality means just this', u'physically you re trying to make something which is not you  a part of yourself ', u'for a few moments you may succeed ', u'if you try this mentally  it gets labeled as greed ', u'conquest or maybe simply shopping', u'shopping  shopping ', u' oh ', u' some people go for conquest with swords and guns ', u'some people go with cheque books and cash  you know credit cards ', u'the thing is you want to include something which is not a part of you as yourself', u'that is the whole effort  tch ', u'whether you want money or wealth or you want to occupy a nation ', u'what is it ', u'something that is not you  you want to make it yours ', u'yours is an effort to make it a part of yourself ', u'if it happens emotionally  on the emotional level if you try this ', u'we call this a love affair ', u'you re trying to make somebody who is not a part of you ', u'a part of yourself emotionally', u'this is a love affair ', u'if you do it consciously  we call this yoga ', u'yoga means union ', u'so  all these efforts are fine ', u'everything has its own beauty but has its own limitations ', u'when you understand the limitations of all the other methods ', u'nothing right or wrong about it ', u'it is just that it will work briefly ', u'it will not work for always ', u'when you realize that  you consciously try to include ', u'when you consciously become an inclusive process ', u'if you sit here ', u'if you experience everything as yourself then we say you are a yogi  okay ', u'so  this is a love affair  successful ', u' so something you said at the end', u'which i would like to ask you again', u'you said love  inclusiveness', u'i can t understand how i can love everybody in this room ', u' you cannot ', u'there are some people you cannot love  ', u' i can barely see  up there and up there ', u'so  how is tha  how do you include everybody in your love ', u' see because you re looking at love as something that comes to you', u'or you yield to the process of love ', u'only because you appreciate a particular quality', u'a shape of somebody s nose or the shape of their mind', u'or their thought or their emotion or the way they speak', u'or the way they do things or the way they relate to you ', u'something  okay ', u'there re many many things ', u'it is based on something that is acceptable to you ', u'if they do something that is not acceptable to you ', u'love crumbles ', u'  yes ', u' now what i m saying is ', u'i want you to look at this  ', u'whether love happens to you or hate happens to you ', u'anger happens to you  misery happens to you  joy happens to you', u'it only happens within you  isn t it ', u' yes ', u' it never  people say love is in the air ', u'no ', u'because you are feeling very pleasant in your emotions ', u'suddenly air feels vibrant ', u'it always been  you missed it all your life ', u'now you re beginning to feel it ', u'  okay  okay ', u' all right  so  whatever human experience  ', u'love or hate  whatever  whatever  ', u'happens only within you ', u'what i am saying is at least what happens within you must happen by your choice ', u'consciously you must be able to make it happen ', u'if you re able to ', u'if your experience or what is happening within you is happening by choice ', u'what is the problem ', u'it only happens within you ', u'love is not a relationship ', u'a relationship is a different thing ', u'love is a certain sweetness of your emotion ', u'whether you look at a tree or a dog or a man or a woman or a child or just at the sky ', u'why can t you look at it lovingly ', u'because it s not about loving the sky ', u'it s about the sweetness of your emotion ', u'if your emotions are sweet ', u'whatever you look at  you will look at it in a certain way ', u'right now you have nasty emotions  whatever you look at ', u'you look at it in a different way ', u'so  you have always associated love with somebody ', u'no  no  no  this is not about somebody', u'love is not something that you do ', u'it is something that you can become ', u'if you re willing  you can become love ', u'you can make your emotion into a very sweet space ', u'if you make your mind', u'if you make your body very pleasant  it becomes pleasure ', u'if you sit here  it can be great pleasure just sitting here and breathing ', u'if your mind becomes pleasant  we say this is joy ', u'if your emotions become pleasant  we say this is love ', u'if your very life energies become pleasant  we say this is blissfulness  this is ecstasy ', u'if your surroundings become pleasant  we call that success ', u'now you re calling your success with somebody as love  that s a mistake ', u'you have a success story with somebody   that is ', u'you have created pleasantness in the atmosphere between you and let s say five ten people around you ', u'you re calling that love ', u'no that is actually success because that needs lots of management ', u' yes  it does ', u' yes or no ', u' yes it does ', u' yes  but for you to be loving  there is no management ', u'if you just make your emotions sweet ', u'your emotions are sweet and it s beautiful be  be like this ', u'it s not about anybody ', u'if somebody comes  we can share it ', u'if nobody comes  you can sit here with eyes closed and still be loving ', u'what s the problem ', u'it is not about somebody  it s not an action ', u'it is not something that you do ', u'it is something that you can become  ', u' it s a  it s a lovely  idyllic', u' it is not idyllic  it is  it is the way it is ', u' it is  i mean you d really have to practice this ', u' why ', u' because i m thinking', u' see  this is what exactly i m saying', u'if it is an action ', u'an action comes to perfection with practice  only if it s an action ', u'i m saying love is not an act ', u'is health an act ', u'are you acting healthy right now ', u' no ', u' i know you re an actor  but are you acting healthy ', u'  no ', u' so health is  because', u' yes ', u'  you have done certain things and health is  isn t it ', u' oh  we ve not done certain things', u' oh  we have definite', u'  we ve been given', u' no  no  no  no  oh  we ve been given  but if you eat bad ', u'if you live bad  you won t be healthy ', u' hmm ', u' we ve done certain things to manage our health ', u'similarly  if you do certain things ', u'you can manage the pleasantness of your mind ', u'if you do certain other things  you can manage the pleasantness of your emotion ', u'if you do certain other things  you can manage the pleasantness of your very life energies ', u'this is things that you can do ', u'now  what you can do internally  you re trying to manage externally ', u'what can be done here within you ', u'you are trying to manage by creating an atmosphere around you', u'which is a very difficult thing to do ', u'because outside will never happen hundred percent the way you want it ', u'to some extent we can manage ', u'we can t do all of it by ourselves', u'because there are many forces involved ', u' sadhguruji  you said something about health ', u'and you said  you do certain things for yourself  certain things ', u'one   you re given health and then how you maintain it is you eat well ', u'you exercise and you remain healthy ', u'now  to be loving when maybe in a household ', u'any situation ', u'maybe outside  like you said  outside forces are not pleasant', u'it doesn t come easily to then just be loving ', u'so  what is the practice to become that way', u'or to train yourself to be that way ', u' i  i want to remove this idea from your mind ', u'you believe you need to practice ', u'practice means you re trying to perfet', u'perfect an action  isn t it ', u' to be loving at all times', u' yes  yes that s not an act ', u' no  not an act  but to be so accepting', u' no  i don t want to', u'i don t want to go back to the movies  okay  ', u' no  to be so accepting because', u' no  it s not about accepting ', u'right now  do you want to keep your mind', u'your thought process pleasant or nasty ', u'tell me  what is your choice ', u' ideally pleasant ', u' just tell me  pleasant or nasty ', u'you re thinking about it  this is', u' no  i am trying to think', u'should i fox you and say nasty  ', u'  say it ', u'  okay  nasty ', u' i m going to bless you now  ', u' no  no  no ', u'okay i take back my words  ', u'okay  all right  so', u" any human being s choice for themselves is definitely pleasantness  isn't it ", u' yes ', u' body  mind  emotion  everything and surroundings', u'you want it pleasant ', u' yes ', u' so why is it not pleasant ', u'surroundings are not pleasant because of many things', u' yes ', u' if your thought and emotion are not pleasant ', u'it s entirely you  isn t it ', u' yes ', u' surroundings   not entirely me  it s so many forces ', u'we have to manage them ', u'we have to juggle them ', u'not always are we successful with everything around us ', u'you know different people have different levels of competence to manage the outside ', u'not all of us have the same  what to say ', u'the skill to manage the outside ', u'but inside  your emotion and your thought ', u'why is it not happening your way ', u'this is something we have to look at ', u'this has to be addressed ', u'every human being has to address this ', u'at least your thought and your emotion must happen the way you want it ', u'on a certain day  a lady went to sleep ', u'a lady went to sleep ', u'in her sleep   she had a dream ', u'i think up there   ', u'oh there are two strata of people  nobody is asleep right  ', u'so that i could pick on you  i m just looking if i can see ', u'she went to sleep  up there ', u'and in her dream  she had a dream ', u'in her dream she saw a hunk of a man standing in that corner ', u'and then he started coming closer and closer and closer ', u'he came so close she could even feel his breath ', u'she trembled  not in fear and then she asked ', u' what will you do to me ', u'the man said   well lady  it s your dream  ', u' okay ', u' i m saying what s happening in your mind is your bloody dream ', u'now the problem with life is  ', u'not that life is not happening the way you want it ', u'even your dream is not happening the way you want it ', u'that s the problem  ', u'i m saying at least fix this ', u'at least let the dream happen the way you want it ', u'if you were dreaming the way you want right now ', u'your thought and your emotion would be pleasant  isn t it ', u' yes  but it  well', u' fixing the world is another thing  that s a different game ', u'that needs lot of skill ', u'this needs just willingness ', u'why we re continuously talking about joy  blissfulness  love ', u'is not because it s a goal by itself ', u'these are not goals by itself', u'only by  when you are pleasant by your own nature ', u'you stop being in pursuit of happiness ', u'you are fine by yourself ', u'you don t have to go anywhere to feel pleasant ', u'you don t have to do anything to feel pleasant ', u'sitting here you re feeling very pleasant ', u'now you will look at life the way it is ', u'otherwise  you re an endless race ', u'pursuit of your happiness is a lifelong thing ', u'till your deathbed you re pursuing ', u'what does it mean ', u'if you re pursuing happiness when you are five  i can understand ', u'but that was not the fact ', u'when you re five you were simply happy by your own nature ', u'when you re fifty  you re pursuing your happiness', u'this is a failed story  isn t it ', u' but  sadhguruji  suppose we say this to the common man ', u'who has a little house', u' where did you meet a common man ', u'  i m imagining it ', u' every man or woman think they re special  believe me', u' oh yes ', u' yes  so where did you meet a common man  i m asking  ', u' okay  sadhguruji when you said about the common person and the special person ', u'i know some teachers have always told us', u'and why your own parents always tell you that you know  ', u'you are special ', u'each one of us is unique', u'and i remember this part ', u'i am not sure whether i heard it at your discourse or on a dvd of yours ', u'where you said  it was about you know people being special', u'and us always thinking that god knows of us ', u'and you said something like ', u' do you know all the grasshoppers in your garden ', u'so  of course all of us have said   no ', u'so  you said something like ', u' so  how does god know each one of you then ', u'and i was devastated because i always thought', u'somebody up there knows me  cares about me and i m special ', u' you thought  you thought you re number', u'you thought you were number one on his books  is it ', u' well  i ve been told since i was kid ', u' you re special  you re unique and god cares about you ', u' let me tell  tch  tch  tch  see  if when somebody says you re unique ', u'it s an insult   you know', u' no  you said   no top line  so you re', u' okay ', u'  peaking in different ways ', u' in this vast cosmos  this solar system is just a speck ', u'tomorrow morning if the whole solar system disappears  vanishes  evaporates ', u'nobody will even notice it ', u'maybe it s not even in the accounts books of creation ', u'it s so small ', u'in this speck of a solar system ', u'planet earth is a super speck ', u'in that  mumbai is a micro super speck ', u'in that  you are a big man or a woman  ', u'this is a huge problem ', u'this is a very immense existential problem  you know  ', u'this is because we have lost perspective as to who we are  what we are ', u'our psychological realities have become bigger than the cosmo  than the cosmic reality ', u'that is the big problem ', u'it s time you step out of your cinema', u'i m  i m not talking about the hindi cinema ', u'i m talking about the cinema that everybody is playing in their own minds ', u'see  see right now they darkened this whole hall', u'because it works best that way ', u'this is the basic technology of a cinema ', u'if you do not darken the cinema hall ', u'if you light it up and play a nice cinema  it s not going to work ', u'you have to darken it ', u'so  i m saying  a cinema of your mind because it s a dark space ', u'every thought is enlarged ', u'playing out bigger than the cosmic space ', u'today  everything in the cosmos is happening perfectly well ', u'but you have one nasty thought crawling in your head', u'and it feels like a bad day  isn t it ', u' yes  yes ', u' so  that s because your psychological realities ', u'your petty creation has become larger than the creator s creation ', u'you lost perspective of life ', u'that is the fundamental basis of all this confusion and suffering ', u'if you see who you are ', u'the micro speck that you are ', u'you wouldn t imagine that god is made in your own image', u'and he looks like you and whatever ', u'okay  if  if we were all buffalos ', u'we would definitely think god is a big buffalo  ', u' okay  okay  so what is it really ', u'please tell us the  please define it for us ', u'what is it ', u'what is going on   this life  this love ', u'all these emotions that we go through in our lives ', u'all these thoughts that we create for ourselves ', u'what is going on ', u' see  these are all human possibilities and capabilities ', u'every possibility becomes a problem', u'for those who do not explore the possibility in its right perspective ', u'thought is a tremendous possibility ', u'an ant cannot think like you ', u'he can work better than you ', u'he s more disciplined ', u'he betters main  better traffic rules than you ', u'there s no traffic jam out there  ', u'okay but he cannot think like you ', u' yes ', u' that sets up apart ', u'this is a possibility ', u'but now  this possibility has become a problem for ninety percent of the humanity ', u'now they re freaking because they can think', u'and they re thinking all the wrong things ', u'their thoughts have become nasty ', u'if they were pleasant they would have enjoyed their thought process ', u'because it s become nasty  it s becoming a ailment  isn t it ', u'people are suffering their thoughts immensely ', u'because they do not know how to keep it pleasant ', u'nothing has been done towards it ', u'so  what is a possibility always becomes a problem', u'if you do not explore it in the right perspective ', u'so your thought and emotion has become a problem ', u'now love affair is a problem ', u'you re making all kinds of things out of it ', u'which are all coming from this misunderstanding ', u'not understanding this thought and emotion is generated by me ', u'i can generate it whichever way i want ', u'if nastiness is what you like  you do it ', u'i don t care if that s what you like', u'but you re suffering it ', u'if you re suffering it  you shouldn t be doing it ', u'i am not telling you   be loving ', u'what is your choice  ', u'pleasantness or unpleasantness ', u'if unpleasantness is your choice  you enjoy it and do it ', u'what s my problem ', u'you want to drink poison  what is my problem ', u'i am just telling you this is poison  this is this  ', u'drink whatever you want  but by choice ', u'don t drink unconsciously  that s stupid ', u'that s not befitting of a human being ', u'a human being means we are far more conscious than every other creature on this planet  ', u'that s what sets us apart ', u'every creature eats but we can eat consciously ', u'so our eating becomes so many things ', u'every creature has sexual drives ', u'they go and fulfill it whichever way ', u'we can do it consciously ', u'so  we become something  something ', u'we re doing the same things but we re doing it consciously ', u'suddenly there is a magic about it ', u'not because sex is magic  food is magic  no ', u'because we can do it consciously ', u'every basic act like eating and copulating becomes magical', u'because we can do it consciously ', u'if you leave that one thing ', u'if you exclude that one thing from your life', u'that you are not conscious about the way you think ', u'the way you feel ', u'the way you act ', u'the way you move your body  ', u'if you re not conscious about it ', u'everything can turn ugly ', u'everything can become nasty ', u'so it is this which sets you apart from every other creature ', u'so  a dog is walking on the street ', u'if you show it a biscuit it will wag its tail ', u'if you do this   grrr it will do ', u'if this is what you are that', u'if somebody is nice to you ', u'you will wag your whatever ', u'if somebody is not nice to you  you will bite them  i m saying what', u'where is evolution in you ', u'forget about civilization  i m  talking about evolution ', u'where s the evolution ', u'where s the sign of evolution i m asking  ', u' okay  sadhguruji let s go to  hmm', u' i ve seen people copying answers in examination but never questions', u' yeah questions  ', u'well ', u'today  many women in our modern society are stepping out and having a career', u'and i just like to know  what do you think of this', u'of women stepping out  being career people  managing home as well ', u'being financially independent ', u'is this good ', u' see every woman should do what she wants to do as an individual person ', u'it should not be made into a trend in a society or the only right thing to do in the world', u'because i think if  if a woman is', u'intends to have two children and raise them ', u'i think it s a full time job ', u'i m not saying she should not go out and work ', u'if she wishes to  as an individual person  she s free to do what she wants to do ', u'but having two children is not about reproduction ', u'you re manufacturing the next generation of people ', u'how the world will be tomorrow ', u'will be determined by what kind of mothers you have today ', u'believe me ', u'you know  i ve seen many ladies coming to me and say ', u'when i ask  what re you doing ', u' oh i m just a housewife ', u'i said   why do you say  you re just a housewife ', u'you  you don t seem to understand the significance of ', u'you know  being able to nurture two or three new lives ', u'it s not  it s not a  not important  job  it s a very important job ', u'career   i want you to understand', u'right now because we have made the whole world into economics', u'unfortunately women also getting as stupid as men ', u'as if how much money you earn is going to determine the value of your life ', u'no ', u'it is just procurement of things that you need ', u'money is just about that ', u'man was procuring ', u'woman was taking about the more beautiful aspects of life ', u'now woman also wants to procure ', u'if there is such an economic need in the family  fine she must do it ', u'but it is not a compulsive need ', u'it must not be set up as something better to do than doing something ', u'if she sings so  if she  if she plays music or if she just loves her children', u'or if she cooks beautifully', u'or she just lives beautifully like a flower ', u'it s good enough  i m saying ', u'it is not necessary that only if she earns this much money  she s  her  she s doing something valuable ', u'otherwise she s not ', u'if there s an economic need  she can do it ', u'or if she has a passion for doing it  she can do it ', u'but  let not such values be set up in the world because you re not evolving ', u'you re regressing ', u'you re making survival more important than aesthetics of life  ', u' okay sadhguruji  let me take you away from this', u'and let me take you to a world of say films where i come from', u' world of films  okay  let s go  let s go movies  ', u' years ago when films started', u'and you know through the sixties  seventies there were lovely stories ', u'nice values  beautiful music  lyrics ', u'by the time i was the star in movies some of our jhatka matka s might have shocked the previous generations', u'and they must have said what is all this ', u'but it was still within limits', u' whose limits  ', u' i mean what s acceptable to society  whatever have been ', u'i ll say  and then now today the complexion of films ', u'the kind of films we see ', u'you know it s little clothed ', u'it s live in relationships', u'or you know up there on screen for everybody to see and night club culture ', u'i mean it sometimes worries me', u'that my children are growing up now', u'this is what they re seeing  this is', u'these are the kind of songs that they re listening to ', u'the lyrics are about you know', u' from janam janam to expiry date is the song  ', u' yes  so this is the', u'this is what they re watching  this is what they think is cool ', u'this is  this is the hip and happening stuff  i m little', u' i think by the time you came the janam janam was over  isn t it  ', u' no  it was still there  it was in the middle somewhere ', u'the music was wonderful  the lyrics was still lovely', u'but today it is munni badhnaam ho gayi and it things', u'things have really moved to chewing gums', u'and i m forgetting at this moment what the lyrics are but then its  its', u'its  shallow right now ', u'india has the youngest population in the world right now', u'so with such a young nation growing up on this  this is the feed', u'i m just a little concerned as to what they will turn out to be ', u' i m sure your parents were concerned too ', u' they   okay  so  can i', u' i m sure my parents were very concerned when i was growing up ', u'so  every parent has this concern  every generation has this concern', u'that the next generation is going wrong always ', u'i understand what you re saying', u'this sudden change if every generation likes to go', u'one step beyond where the previous generation has stepped in  on eve', u'almost everything just for the sake of doing something different or it s natural they ve grown up in one atmosphere', u'they take it to another level ', u' they move to the next level ', u' yes  next is not always next  that s what you re saying ', u'next is not always next  right ', u' yes  it s not higher', u' okay ', u' it s somewhere else  it s just  it s', u' it s just next ', u'so  this concern is always there but', u'right now the change that is happening is not the next', u'it is a serious influence because', u'in the last fifteen years the world s ability to communicate across cultures and borders', u'is so heavy and so unprecedented ', u'nobody has ever been used to these kind of influences before ', u'okay  never before this level of influence on our young people', u'never before possible', u'no other generation has ever experienced this kind of onslaught from so many directions', u'and the volume of influence is too big ', u'so in terms of changes are happening not ', u'it is not next', u'it is simply somewhere and nobody knows where it is', u'because it s too complex and too mixed ', u'nobody knows where it is including the young people ', u'it s just a mix of things ', u'so this is because of a sudden onslaught of information and communication ', u'it s not for us to judge whether it s good or bad ', u'it is just that definitely this level of information  ', u'when i say information ', u'it s like when we were growing up', u'i believe it was true for your generation also', u'we  we never knew what is boredom  okay ', u'this was  there was no such thing ', u'we were just excited about everything that came our way ', u'but you see today twelve year old kids ', u'if you tell them what   ahhm ', u' yes  ', u' you see they re just bored because', u'they know the whole cosmos there it s', u'they have seen it on their phone screen not even on a computer screen ', u'on the phone screen they ve seen the entire cosmos ', u'they know everything ', u'things that you do not know they know ', u'you ask them they know it ', u' yes ', u' by information', u'by the time they re eighteen they have had five love affairs and gone  ', u'in the western world it s like that here also it s beginning to happen  okay ', u'so by the time they re eighteen they ve seen everything that you need to see', u'with body  mind  emotion  okay ', u'by the time they re twenty five what ', u'what next ', u' what next  yes ', u' no  you will see  this is not my wish', u'but this is something that i see the way people s minds are working ', u'the way they re being led in with information  ', u'i m not a  by any standards a pessimistic person', u'but i m just seeing this', u'if this level of information continues and it will multiply many fold', u'for the coming generations ', u'you should not be surprised', u'in the next fifty to hundred years', u'if fifty percent of the human population choose to commit suicide', u'you should not be surprised', u'because that is what will happen to the mind  ', u'somebody is clapping  look at this it s popular  ', u' no you have just touched a chord and that s', u' no  i m saying', u' we think we realize something ', u' today  today', u'this day more people commit suicide in this world', u'than all the wars and murders and accidents manage to kill ', u'so more people are on self help already than', u'murderers  war mongers  bad drivers  everything put together ', u'more people are on self help ', u'and if this level of information onslaught continues on human mind  ', u'i know the nature of mind absolutely because i know my mind ', u'i know how it works  what it can handle  what it cannot do ', u'i know it clearly what human mind is ', u'that s the reason why i don t have to read people s books', u'or listen to their entire thing', u'if they say one sentence i know what their mind is', u'because i know the structure of human mind entirely ', u'otherwise i wouldn t be who i am ', u'so i m saying this ', u'if this level of information onslaught continues at the same phase or at higher phase ', u'which is possible in the next few years ', u'this will definitely lead to wanting to terminate yourself', u'because there would be nothing to live for ', u'there is no joy and excitement about anything ', u'you please watch your children', u'by the time they re twelve  fifteen they re just bored ', u'you look back at your own life those of you who are over fifty years of age', u'just look back at in  or  on your own life ', u'when you were twelve  fifteen', u'was there any room for you to get bored about anything ', u'simply you are excited about every little thing  isn t it ', u' yeah ', u' today you will see it s almost a common feature', u'twelve  fifteen year old kids are just bored only thing is  ', u' yes  they are all on ipad s and iphones  yes  they are on gadgets ', u' because we re talking about love and life  ', u'all this will not mean nothing because you had one love affair when you were eighteen years of age ', u'you thought this is your life and you re going to  willing to die for it ', u'whether you died for it or not but at least at that time you thought you ll die for it  okay ', u'today by the  on facebook they had twenty two love affairs going simultaneously  ', u'it just means nothing ', u'i  i m not saying they should have it or not have it ', u'all i m saying is this will lead to a certain overload on the mind', u'and suddenly a human being will think why am i here ', u'you know that big shakespearian question', u' to be or not to be ', u' yes ', u' this is not the most intelligent question  ', u'unfortunately people think so', u'this is only because you have not been touched by life ', u'you are not a piece of life ', u'you re just a psychological case ', u'you are full of thoughts and emotions ', u'you have not touched life at all ', u'you think your thoughts and la  emotions are life ', u'no ', u'your thoughts and emotions are the drama that you are creating in your mind ', u'it is your cinema ', u'you must be able to end it somewhere ', u'if you do not know how to put  the end  then it s going on endless cinema you re going crazy ', u'life is happening here ', u'you know your work is not life ', u'your family is not life  your career is not life ', u'your cinema is not life  your thought is not life ', u'your emotion is not life ', u'life is happening here ', u'everything else is accessories to life ', u'now the frills of life have become larger than life itself ', u'life is entirely missed ', u'if you touch life within you  then it s an explosion of energy ', u'when such a thing never happens to you ', u'because you have information about the whole cosmos on your phone screen ', u'you ll never be touched by life because too much information  too much thought ', u'even emotion is drying up  too much thought ', u'this has happened ', u'if you look at european philosophy in the last hundred  hundred and fifty years', u'you will see if you read dostoyevsky you will want to commit suicide ', u'brilliant  intellectually brilliant', u'but you will wonder why are you alive', u'because intellect is like that  if you wake up in the morning', u'devoid of any  touching any life s experience within you', u'don t think about your child s face ', u'do not think about the flowers in the garden ', u'birds in the sky ', u'nothing beautiful that ever touched you', u'just think logically you have to get out of bed that s not a small feat ', u'you have to brush your teeth  breakfast  go to work  eat  work  eat  sleep', u'again tomorrow morning same thing ', u'next fifty years you have to do the same process every day ', u'if you look at it one hundred percent logically and intellectually', u'you will have no reason to live today morning', u'tomorrow morning ', u'it s only if you re touched by something suddenly it s worth living ', u'if you re not touched by anything then it s not worth living ', u'what is  what is so worth living about a human being  ', u'waking up in the morning ', u'totking  tro  tr  you know troding  through life ', u'trudging through life everyday eating  sleeping  same rubbish ', u'what is the point ', u'there is no point  unless you re touched by something ', u'some magic of life if it doesn t touch you either in the form of love', u'or in the form of a flower or in the form of something within you ', u'if something doesn t sparkle within you definitely there is a question', u'whether i should live or not  isn t it ', u'and we are taking humanity in that direction with this overload of information ', u'information is not knowing ', u'information is just garbage collection ', u'you just gather things which don t mean anything to you ', u'you look smart in a tea party but you re not smart with life ', u'okay ', u'if you re smart with life you must be blissful  isn t it  ', u'if you re really smart with life you must be joyful and blissful  isn t it so ', u'you re only smart in a tea party', u'because you know when somebody is talking something ', u' you know the galaxy z22 ', u'what happens there ', u'everybody   wow  ', u'they can also open the internet and the same thing ', u'you see  you think this guy visited the galaxy  ', u' so sadhguruji then what is it ', u'okay so for all of us ', u'give us in clear simple  simple sentences  ', u'do this and you will be at least on the way to be blissful or happy or aware or', u'living in a nice conscious way  ', u' see if you  if you just observe ', u'if everybody makes a little effort ', u'everybody take a little time for this piece of life  okay ', u'not for your family ', u'not for your career ', u'not for something else  something else ', u'just for this piece of life give it little time', u'because this is the most important piece of life in your life  isn t it ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' even if you re in love with somebody  ', u'still this is the most important piece of life  isn t it ', u'so pay some attention to this ', u'how does it happen  why have you taken it for granted ', u'believe me you re not going to be here for an ever ', u'i ll bless you with a long life but you re going to fall dead one day  ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' so do not take this for granted ', u'if you wake up in the morning', u'tomorrow if you wake up in the morning ', u'no this is not my wish but i want you to know', u'of all that people who go to bed tonight ', u'over a million people will not wake up tomorrow morning', u'and tomorrow if you and me wake up tomorrow morning ', u'is it not a fantastic thing ', u'a million people did not wake up ', u'you woke up ', u'is it not a great thing ', u' yes ', u' just look at the ceiling and smile ', u'you are still awake  ', u'you re still there ', u'a million people did not get up in the morning', u'and you woke up', u'and for many  many millions of people', u'somebody  who is dear to them did not wake up ', u'so just check those five  six people around you', u'they all woke up   wow  it s a fantastic day  ', u'you woke up and everybody who matters to you around you woke up ', u'is it not fantastic day ', u' yes ', u' you don t think so ', u' yes ', u' yes  yes ', u' you don t seem to think so', u'because the problem is just this you are living with an idea that you are immortal ', u'when i say you re immortal ', u'you re not actually thinking you re immortal', u'but you re not conscious of your mortality ', u'if you re not conscious of your mortality ', u'somewhere you think you re immortal  isn t it ', u'how many moments in a day are you conscious that you re mortal ', u'if you were conscious would you have time to crib ', u'would you have time to fight with somebody ', u'would you have time to do some rubbish with your life ', u'if you knew', u'if you re conscious that you are mortal you would do nothing', u'other than what is absolutely needed for you and everybody around you ', u'this one thing if you do', u'if you just remind yourself you', u'don t think this is a negative thing ', u'death is not a negative thing  it s the only thing which has added value to your life ', u'if you re here forever you would be unbearable  ', u' yeah   yes  yes ', u' isn t it ', u'aren t we glad everybody dies one day  ', u'if you just become conscious of this one thing', u'that always you re conscious that  i m mortal ', u'you don t have to think  i will die today ', u'we don t intend  we want to live as far as possible ', u'just you know  one day i will die ', u'if you re just conscious of this one thing', u'you will naturally become spiritual ', u'you will not become spiritual by thinking about god ', u'you will become unrealistic  hallucinatory  you will start talking to somebody ', u'you will start doing all kinds of things ', u'already people  you know they have ear phones on and they re talking', u'you don t know whether they ve lost it or they  ', u'ten years ago if somebody was walking on the street talking you would know that he s lost', u'but today you don t know  ', u'whether they got their head phones on', u'or they just lost it and they re talking  we cannot make out ', u'but if you are conscious that you re mortal every moment of your life ', u'spiritual process has begun for you ', u'so the one  one of the main reasons ', u'one of the fundamental reasons why that all these things have to be taught to you that she is repeatedly asking this question', u' were you born special  did you have normal birth or not  is simply because', u'most people have forgotten they are mortal ', u'they think they re immortal  they may not actually think they re immortal', u'but they re not conscious they are mortal ', u'with every step with every breath if they were conscious of this ', u'you know how consciously they would live ', u'they would become fantastic  it is your mortality which makes you  want to know what is the nature of your existence ', u'you really want to know where you came from  where you will go only when it sinks into you', u'all this drama pup   one day it will end', u'but right now you think only others appear in obituary columns ', u'you are only going to read it  ', u' that was  that was simply beautiful ', u' that s all that s needed', u'if you want to know the value of life', u'just know that it s a brief happening ', u'the time that you spend here as life it s a very relative experience ', u'if you re truly joyful and ecstatic  it s horribly brief  believe me ', u'i feel like i was born day before yesterday ', u'see already how i have become    okay ', u'  yes  yes ', u' but on a particular day if you re depressed or miserable ', u'one day seems like an endless thing ', u'so  only miserable people have a looooooooong life  ', u'if you re a joyful  ecstatic person life is always brief ', u'if you live to be hundred it s still very brief ', u'for what possibilities a human being carries  for the immensity of what a human being is  ', u'it s too brief a life ', u'if you re given hundred years  two hundred years it s still  still too brief', u'because before you know what s happening before you exp  exp  explore a few dimensions of life it ll be over ', u'it ll be over  over  okay ', u'only miserable people have a very long life ', u'they feel it s very long  ', u' sadhguruji here we have a few questions', u'the first stion is from prabhas sundaras  sundar sen  ', u'where and how do we draw the line between loving unconditionally', u'and becoming a doormat  ', u' see we need to understand this  ', u'what s being right now passed around as love is generally a mutual benefit scheme', u'you give me this  i ll give you that ', u'if you don t give me that i don t give you this', u'this is not said but it s done  ', u' okay  ', u' it s done  isn t it ', u'it s not said ', u'so  human beings have physical  psychological  emotional  economic  social', u'and various other kinds of needs ', u'to fulfill these things', u'when you say  i love you ', u'instead of making these things ugly needs that we have to', u'ugly transactions that we have to do   you give me this  you give me that', u'to bring some aesthetic and beauty to this transaction ', u'we quote it with a certain amount of sweetness of emotion', u'which we call as love affair', u'where the transactions happen more smoothly', u'because once we are human somehow doing basic transactions in a basic way makes us feel ugly ', u'if you take food with both your hands and eat it  it s ugly  isn t it ', u'we want to eat in a certain way ', u'similarly to fulfill our physical needs ', u'emotional needs  economic needs we have arrangements ', u'where we can conduct this in a more aesthetic manner ', u'i m not saying it s right or wrong  this is the fact of life ', u'so  this level of love ', u'i call this', u'this is enough for  to fulfill the domestic needs of one s', u'you know for two people to live together ', u'to fulfill their needs ', u'to produce children ', u'to raise them  domestic level of love affair people can have ', u'but if people want to have a love affair which will bring them to an ultimate union ', u'then not many people are competent to do that ', u'not people  not many people are ready to have that kind of a love affair', u'where it ll make two lives into one ', u'two becomes actually one in experience', u'that will need something more ', u'most people are competent of using love to fulfill the domestic needs', u'but to go beyond that they are not ready ', u'when i say they re not ready  either', u'i m not talking about this person or that person ', u'so when one is ready and another is not ready or', u'one is making an effort and another doesn t have the effort ', u'then it feels like somebody is becoming a doormat ', u'that is what it is that it feels like they re being exploited', u'but above all  one who is longing to become  use love as a way of ultimate union', u'should not be bothered about being doormat  this and that ', u'in india we have a culture', u'where by choice people name themselves as slaves ', u'you know ramdas  krishnadas  this das  that das', u'what is this ', u'they re openly saying  i m a slave ', u'i m a doormat ', u'i want to be a doormat ', u'they are not saying   i m afraid i ll be used as a doormat ', u'they re saying   i want to be doormat ', u'so  this is a kind of love that they re wanting to use to', u'use for ultimate union ', u'this is not for domestic purposes ', u'so  if you re looking for ultimate union then love is a different affair ', u'if you re looking for conducting of domestic affairs', u'then you must manage dignity ', u'who gets what ', u'if anybody is using more than what they should then', u'if you don t give me that i don t give you this  okay ', u'otherwise if you re looking for ultimate union', u'you should not think of all these things  that s a different affair ', u'that s not for normal social thing ', u'if you fall in love itself you become vulnerable to somebody ', u' yes ', u' without becoming vulnerable there is no love affair ', u'you have to fall ', u'when you fall  somebody may raise you', u'or somebody may walk over you  ', u' yes ', u' but the thing is the', u'the experience of your life is beautiful', u'because you fell not because they raised you ', u'not because they walked over you ', u'because you could actually have the sense of abandon in you to fall ', u'that was the beauty of your love affair', u'not what they gave you  what they did to you  this   no ', u'the beauty was you sat alone and you think you really loved this person', u'so much you re willing to die ', u'that was the most beautiful moment  ', u'not the moment they gave you a big gift ', u'not the moment they gave you a diamond ring ', u'not the moment they said this and that about you   no ', u'you just sat here and you re willing to die  that was the moment ', u'not just a doormat ', u'you re willing to be the dust on their feet  okay ', u'i m not saying you should be like that  ', u'i m saying where love transformed itself into a devotion ', u'if you fall in love itself you become very vulnerable', u'but there are still some shreds of sanity in love affairs that you can recover ', u'but if you become a devotee there is no sanity left and you cannot recover ', u'so  before you tread such a land', u'you must see whether you re for it or not ', u'what are your goals first of all ', u'if your goal is to make a life a cautioned ', u'a very measured love affair is good', u'but you re  your  your thing is you want to dissolve into the process of life', u'you don t want to have a good life ', u'you re not planning to have a good life', u'you just want to become explosion of life ', u'you don t care what you get and what you don t get ', u'then you become a devotee ', u'a devotion means it s your intention to dissolve into your object of devotion ', u'so a devotee is not expecting whether i ll become a doormat or a crown on somebody s head ', u'whatever i become as long as i can touch your feet or head or whatever ', u'it s fine with me ', u' yeah ', u' so that s a different state of existence ', u'i don t think', u'somebody who is looking for domestic level of love affair should even ask that question  ', u' mmm  we have one question from the social media the facebook  ', u'amitmadan wants to know', u'in this materialistic age the real feeling of love is disappearing from our life ', u'most of the love we receive from others and express to others is superficial ', u'how can we reinforce the real feeling of love in our own life and in others ', u' forget about others ', u'if you', u'if you learn to be loving by your own nature', u'not because of somebody else or something else', u'i know the question is coming from facebook ', u'there s an enormous possibility  ', u'you can even love those people who don t even exist  ', u'so  i m saying it s a tremendous possibility', u'so ', u'if you just become love ', u'not love somebody then you will know the nature of love ', u'if you love somebody it s a fickle happening', u'because no human being will happen hundred percent the way you want them ', u'every human being on this planet is going to disappoint you  believe me ', u'not because they ll do something wrong because nobody can fulfill the', u'unrealistic expectation you have of them ', u'it s simply not possible ', u'have you been able to fulfill anybody s expectation i m asking you entirely ', u'partially but never entirely  isn t it ', u'so nobody else will be able to do it', u'unless you re a still such a hopeless romantic', u'you re still waiting that ideal person is going to come from somewhere  ', u'no ', u'believe me whoever comes ', u'i want you to know the ideal people whom you worship ', u'when krishna was there his wives complained   all right ', u' so there is no hope for us ', u'yes ', u'please remember this   okay ', u'sadhguruji this is where we open yes the platform ', u'its  anybody has a question this is the moment ', u' my name is ananth ', u'my question is about marriage ', u'divorce ', u' no  no  they are two different things  ', u' what i see today is many youngsters like many of them they don t want to marry', u'and few of them who marry', u'there are occasions where they are getting divorced ', u'so would you like to throw some light on this situation sadhguru ', u' see  you need to understand the institution of marriage ', u'one thing is as we said a little while ago', u'it s about bringing a certain sanctity to the simple basic needs that every human being has ', u'i will repeat there are physical needs ', u'there are psychological needs ', u'there are economic needs ', u'emotional needs ', u'social needs ', u'variety of needs ', u'to fulfill all these things we set up an institution called marriage', u'where all these can be conducted in a sensible manner ', u'otherwise if we did it on the streets like every other creature', u'it would turn ugly for us ', u'and we will feel not good about it ', u'so  to bring some sense of organization ', u'some aesthetic ', u'some stability ', u'because man and woman coming together naturally brought fresh life ', u'the nature of human life ', u'the nature of human offspring is such', u'that because of the possibilities that a human being carries ', u'it is  compared to any other creature  it is the most helpless life', u'which needs maximum amount of support ', u'you could leave a puppy on the street ', u'as long as he gets food  he grows up into a good dog ', u'no problem ', u'but not so with a human being ', u'he doesn t need just physical support ', u'he needs variety of support and stab  above all the stable situation ', u'whether there should be marriage in society or not', u'one will debate when they are eighteen because', u'physical body is asking for freedom  all right ', u'at that time everybody questions  ', u'is marriage really needed ', u'why can t we just live whichever way we want ', u'but when you are three years of age you valued marriage immensely ', u'a stable marriage immensely ', u'isn t it so ', u'yes or no ', u' yes  yes ', u' not yours ', u'your parents ', u' the parents  yes  ', u' when you were three  four of yours', u'three  four years of age you re one hundred percent for marriage', u'again when you become forty five  fifty again you re hundred percent for marriage', u'between and eighteen and thirty five you re questioning the whole process  ', u'okay ', u' that s true  ', u' i m not saying marriage is the thing but do you have a better alternative ', u'if you have a better alternative ', u'damn the marriage', u'but you have not come up with a better alternative', u'because a stable situation is a must for a child ', u'once you have a child it s a twenty year project   okay ', u'that is if they do well ', u'if they don t do well it s a lifelong project  ', u'so if you want to get into such projects', u'at least twenty years there must be a commitment to create a stable situation ', u'your whims and fancies will change ', u'your emotions will change ', u'if that is what it is  don t get into such situations ', u'it s not compulsory for everybody to get married ', u'it s good young pe  you were saying people are thinking whether to get married ', u'i m glad it is not necessary for everybody', u'but if you get into it and if you  especially if you get into children', u'you must understand  it s a minimum twenty year project', u'whether you like it or you don t like it ', u'otherwise you shouldn t get into those projects ', u'you don t walk into a project ', u'drop it half way and walk away  isn t it ', u'they have their benefits and they have their problems ', u'it s your choice but at least choose consciously ', u'you don t have to get married because everybody is getting married ', u'you don t have to talk about marriage and divorce in same breath', u'as if they come together  ', u'this is a completely an american idea ', u'you re thinking of marriage and divorce together', u'nobody thought of divorce in this country till recently  isn t it ', u'why should you ever talk about marriage and divorce in one breath ', u'it s  it s a crime ', u'it s really a crime to think on those lines ', u'but if it so happens', u'something truly went wrong between two people', u'and they have to separate that will any way inevitably happen ', u'you don t have to plan it at the time of wedding  ', u' namaskaram sadhguru ', u'namaskaramjuhi mam ', u'you mentioned about survival', u'and you talked about aesthetics of life ', u'i would like', u'i would request you to elaborate on aesthetics of life', u'and my second question is for my friend  ', u'i don t know whether you will answer it or not', u'but i just want to mention it over here', u'because she has requested me to do so ', u'her question is', u'what is the purpose of this universe ', u' oh  tell your friend i didn t make it  ', u' thank you so much ', u' why am i being blamed for these things   i', u'the only thing i have done is i ve figured the nature of my life', u'and by figuring the nature of this life', u'i know by inference', u'every life has happened the same way ', u'not just every life ', u'the very cosmos has happened the same way ', u'if you know the nature of this life from its origin to its ultimate', u'you know the nature of everything by inference ', u'everything that s worth knowing ', u'so  tell your friend i didn t make this universe', u'so don t blame me for such big things ', u'i just figured my way through my life', u'and we should figure it', u'if you figure it you will see the most important thing that s happening in your life right now is', u'that you re alive ', u'nothing else ', u'not that stocks have gone up today that s not the most important thing ', u'not your love affair ', u'not this and that  ', u'if you don t understand what i m saying', u'suppose tomorrow you lost  i m not saying you must wish', u'i m not wishing you must loose', u'but suppose tomorrow you lost half your money and you re feeling depressed', u'and your mind says i want to die ', u'close your mouth  hold your nose like this  for two minutes ', u'your body says to hell with your money  i want to live  ', u'tomorrow you found your  love affair collapsed', u'and your mind says i want to die ', u'check   ', u'the life within you says to hell with your love affair  i want to live ', u'every time you feel little suicidal or depressed', u'just check  ', u'the life within you says to hell with all these things  i want to live ', u'so  i want to know the most important thing that s happening to you right now is life itself ', u'not the fancy thoughts that you have ', u'not the emotions that you have ', u'not financial arrangements', u'or family arrangements', u'or whatever rubbish you have built around you', u'these are all accessories to life ', u'these are all frills ', u'frills are so much you re missing the skirt ', u'that s the whole problem with you  ', u'yes ', u'so much frill', u'fundamental things are forgotten  ', u'so this is the most important thing ', u'right now for most people life means their job ', u'life means the new house they re building ', u'life means the car that they bought ', u'life means their wife  their husband  their children  ', u'no ', u'life means what s throbbing here  ', u'not even your body ', u'not your mind ', u'not your thought ', u'not your emotion ', u'what is right now throbbing here  this is life ', u'because this is on everything else seems

very operational at this moment  ', u'it s because i don t know what to say', u'because i feel i ve lived with you in this last week ', u'i ve done all my research ', u'watched all your shows  from ', u' see  you have', u'you have done your homework but', u'because i am homeless   i ve', u'i have not done my homework ', u' i have done a fair amount of my homework ', u'i have watched everyone from anupam kher to juhi chawla in conversation with you ', u'barkha dutt  to a very subdued arnab goswami as well  ', u'i do believe in your mystical power because you managed to achieve that', u'and i think that is not anything lesser of an achievement than you ve done ', u'within your span of tremendous work  sadhguru ', u'so my felicitations on that achievement  ', u'and more than anything else ', u'when i just saw the av that all of us saw ', u'i ve heard all these terminologies associated with you ', u'which is from the monk on a motorcycle ', u'rockstar spiritual energy ', u'and i saw that happen ', u'you re on a motorbike ', u'you are flying a helicopter ', u'so there are so many terms that i said ', u'rockstar spiritual energy', u'and i want to create my own one say you re like almost the santa claus of spirituality  ', u'because you bring the energy through that chimney of life', u'and i think have really touched so many millions of people across the world ', u'so we are blessed to be in your presence at this moment', u'and i can t wait to be in conversation  which is i am going to start ', u'but i just want to start by saying that this is truly an honor ', u'so thank you  ', u'i mean  as a filmmaker ', u'as a human being ', u'as a member of a humanitarian community ', u'my head is always buzzing with so many questions', u'and i think we bottle it down to some spiritual inquiries ', u'some religious ones ', u'there s always been a debate about these two terms  ', u'religion and then spirituality ', u'there are people who feel like ', u' i m not religious  i m spiritual ', u'and i m not quite sure they know the meaning of that ', u'but they use it because sometimes terms are just thrown around ', u'to those people who are at the crossroad between religion and spirituality ', u'what is your answer to that dilemma ', u' see  we must understand this ', u'it is in the very nature of human intelligence', u'that if you do not know something ', u'if you realize you do not know something  ', u'because most people do not realize that they do not know   ', u'if you realize that you do not know ', u'it s very natural for your intelligence to seek to know ', u'it doesn t need a guru ', u'it doesn t need a scripture ', u'it doesn t need somebody to introduce that to you ', u'it is in the nature of your intelligence that you wish to know ', u'there re lots of experiments to show ', u'even mice  if you leave them in a place ', u'within two minutes they will research everything in that space  ', u'for their own reasons of course ', u'for survival reasons  they ', u'you know  inquire into everything around them to find out how the place is ', u'human intelligence goes beyond survival ', u'so naturally  human intelligence seeks to know many more things ', u'which does not concern our survival ', u'yes  we are concerned about survival till a point ', u'but once that s taken care of  we cannot rest ', u'we want to know more  endlessly more ', u'the more we realize we do not know ', u'the more the longing to know ', u'so this longing to know ', u'when it finds a very intense expression in the form of seeking ', u'we call this spiritual process ', u'or in other words ', u'the basis of spirituality is a realization that   i do not know  ', u'but the moment you say   i m religious ', u'you refer to yourself as a believer ', u'when you say you re a believer ', u'what you are saying is ', u' everything that i do not know  i will make it up ', u'how i make it up ', u'whose help i seek to make it up ', u'may be varying from person to person ', u'somebody makes it up because of  with spiritual assist', u'with scriptural assistance ', u'somebody makes it up with the assistance of a priest  or a pundit  or a guru  or whatever ', u'but you seek some authority ', u'you kind of make some compromise in your life ', u'that instead of truth  you settle for an authority as the truth ', u'spiritual process means truth is the only authority for you ', u'authority is never the truth for you ', u'so these are two different aspects ', u'unfortunately spoken in the same breath most of the time ', u'so  i would say spiritual process is far closer to scientific inquiry ', u'see  even the fly is trying to investigate me  ', u' trust me  i am not investigating  ', u'i am just inquiring', u'and i wish i was the size of that fly but anyway', u'  no  no i did not', u'i did not use the word investigation in a negative way ', u'nothing wrong with investigation ', u'investigation means you want to know the truth ', u'maybe it s done little forcefully like a fly  ', u'he s coming to you now  ', u' that s all i get these days  ', u' no  if you get to fly  what more  ', u' well  you manage pretty well ', u'i have a fear of turbulence  ', u'so flying is really not on my top three things to do in life ', u' so  spiritual process does not demand belief', u'because belief and spiritual process cannot go together ', u'spiritual process is a constant inquiry to', u'it is a way of sharpening your questions ', u'so they dig deeper and deeper  ', u'not into something else but into yourself ', u'the nature of your existence ', u'because the nature of human existence is such that in our experience ', u'the only thing that you can experience is yourself ', u'you actually believe you re experiencing many things ', u'but you only know everything the way it happens within you ', u'you do not know any other way ', u'even now if you see these people ', u'it looks like they are there ', u'but actually you know them or you see them only the way they re projected in the firmament of our minds ', u'there is no other way ', u'there is no other way for you to experience this life  ', u'except the way it happens within you ', u'now spiritual process is a constant effort to see', u'that the way that it happens within me', u'is not a distorted vision ', u'that my mirror is not a wonky mirror ', u'it is a plain mirror  ', u'that it shows me things', u'the way they  way things are ', u'it doesn t distort anything ', u'because of my thought ', u'because of my emotion ', u'because of my attachments ', u'because of my identities ', u'because of the philosophies and ideologies that i identify with ', u'i can distort my mirror ', u'now  i deprive myself of all that ', u'so that i have a plain mirror', u'and i get to see everything just the way it is ', u'this is spiritual process ', u' no  well  thank you because that s always been a continued dilemma ', u'and i believe that the word spirituality is sometimes misused ', u'where there is not a grave understanding of what it really is ', u'and as you said  that the  i don t know ', u'has immense power and i think acknowledging the  i don t knows  of your life really means everything', u'and i wish people would start doing that', u'because according to me ', u'sometimes delusion is the biggest disease that plagues humanity  ', u'when you re not aware of your own self ', u' no  there are  there are all kinds of idiots on the planet  ', u' yeah  we work with many of them  ', u' but we must understand this ', u'in the very nature of who we are  it is such  like this ', u'if you do something stupid today ', u'tonight your intelligence will bother you   why did i do this ', u'this is the nature of human intelligence ', u'but the moment your stupidity is either scripture endorsed or god endorsed ', u'you can go on doing the same idiotic thing with enormous confidence ', u'it gives you confidence without clarity ', u'confidence without clarity is a disastrous process ', u'if you do not have clarity ', u'at least you must have hesitation  ', u' yes that s true  ', u'well  i have to say that i was  ', u'i want to personalize this a little bit  ', u'i was at a crossroad about thirteen years ago', u'and my father was very critically ill ', u'and at that juncture of my life and before that ', u'religion was organized in my life ', u'it was what was taught to me ', u'it was what i thought the right thing to do was ', u'when he was in his last stage ', u'there were things suggested to me ', u'which were to me now completely ridiculous ', u'including going to a certain temple and feeding a cow of a certain color', u'and doing a certain ritual at home', u'and all those things that one did even without even thinking ', u'because as you said  when you spoke about the idiots on this planet ', u'i was definitely one of those in that stage in my life ', u'but sometimes you reach a critical stage ', u'where you seek any kind of desperate measure', u'and you try to kind of hold on to any hope ', u'that even something that is advocated to you', u'that goes against your grain of intelligence or thought ', u'to those people  what is your advice ', u'who have reached the end of their rope', u'and are hanging on and holding on to anything ', u'be it religious ', u'be it spiritual  or be it', u'an unfounded piece of advice ', u' see  for all this ', u'the fundamental basis of these kind of aspirations or actions', u'is because people are just shit scared of life ', u'why is it so ', u'it s like this ', u'suppose you sat on a bicycle  on stand  you know ', u'and started simply pedaling for fun ', u'but it came off the stand and started rolling  ', u'anxiety ', u'faster   fear ', u'very fast   terror ', u'the fundamental reason is', u'but someone who knows how to ride a bicycle ', u'the faster it goes  the better it is ', u'but for someone who does not know how to ride a bicycle ', u'the moment it moves  terror will happen ', u'so the fundamental thing is just this ', u'you have been given a very complex and sophisticated vehicle', u'to pass through the process of this life ', u'which is human mechanism ', u'there is body  mind  emotion  energy ', u'many dimensions to it ', u'essentially  this human mechanism is a very complex phenomena ', u'now you are going at it ', u'you are trying to walk through life', u'without understanding a thing about the vehicle that you are using ', u'every time it moves  there is terror ', u'if it doesn t move  you want to die of boredom ', u'if it moves  you re terrorized ', u'there is no way out of it ', u'tell me one thing  tell me one thing that human beings are not suffering ', u'if they are poor  they suffer poverty ', u'if they become rich  they suffer taxes ', u'if they are not educated  they suffer that ', u'you send them to school  endless suffering  ', u'they are not married  they suffer that ', u'you get them married   ', u' yeah  i was heading to that next ', u' i didn t say a thing  they are the ones ', u' well  that s an extreme validation of the institution  ', u' so  tell me one thing that they re not suffering ', u'so now somebody develops a philosophy  ', u'life is suffering ', u'you know  there are philosophies like this  ', u'now it s not about life', u'because you ve not even touched life yet ', u'all that you re dabbling with is right now', u'your own thought and emotion and it s going crazy ', u'so  you are on a bicycle that you don t know how to ride ', u'but this  is not just a simple two wheeled bicycle ', u'it s a complex machine ', u'you don t know how to ride ', u'you don t know how to manage your thought ', u'you don t know how to manage your emotion ', u'all these things ', u'human experience is essentially happening from within you ', u'whether it s misery or joy ', u'agony or ecstasy is happening from within you ', u'at least what happens from within you', u'must happen your way  isn t it ', u'the world will not happen your way ', u'but the problem now is', u'what happens within you is not happening yeur  your way ', u'what s happening in your mind is a dream ', u'even your dream is not happening your way ', u'that s the problem  ', u'the problem is not that your life is not happening your way ', u'even your dream is not happening your way ', u'and this is the source of their misery', u'but they think it s marriage ', u'they think it s children ', u'they think it s poverty  ', u'no ', u'fundamentally  it is just that you are not happening the way you want yourself to be ', u'that s all your misery is ', u'so  even if you want to learn to ride a bicycle ', u'it s a simple basic machine ', u'it needs a certain level of attention and involvement ', u'otherwise you can t ride a bicycle ', u'takes an enormous amount of intent to want to ride it ', u'otherwise it s quite impossible to ride a bicycle ', u'after you know how to ride it  you can let your hands off ', u'you can close your eyes and do all these things ', u' pretty much like marriage ', u'because like wheels are turning but going nowhere  ', u'at times  ', u' no  no  i wouldn t like to make that statement ', u'because for a many people they have gotten somewhere with marriage  ', u' yes  we d like to find out where  ', u'but on another forum ', u'when you speak about suffering  sadhguru ', u'it is definitely something that i believe', u'that self pity sometimes is like a luxury spa ', u'it s somewhere where your comfort lies ', u'self pity is i believe the most indulgent emotion', u'and gets you nowhere but makes you feel really good for a certain period of time ', u'what is your take on something like self pity ', u' how is being pitiful a luxury ', u"i don't understand that ", u' it becomes  you know', u'you get great solace in that emotion  for a short period of time ', u'self pity can be the most happy place to be at ', u'like self indulgences ', u' see  there are many ways to achieve piece ', u'happiness  well being  tch ', u'this happened ', u'shankaran pillai  ', u'in his', u'he was a little abusive husband ', u'verbally abusive ', u'so he would rant at his wife but she was always peaceful ', u'never reacted ', u'one day in the middle of his raging rant ', u'he stopped and he asked ', u' whatever i say  how much ever i abuse you  you are peaceful ', u'how do you do this ', u'she said   i clean the toilet ', u'he said   what  cleaning the toilet ', u'how does it make you peaceful ', u'she said   i use your toothbrush   ', u'so  don t fall on to that', u' you are giving lots of people ideas  ', u'so that s not a relationship ', u'it s a revenge story  ', u' no  you can achieve peace and solace in so many different ways ', u'i am saying  ', u' which is what you said ', u'to draw from within to find your solutions ', u'because the most exciting line that i read was', u'that life can t touch you  can t scratch you ', u'it can t harm you ', u'you create your own energy in your own life ', u'you re in this universe  you ve been brought into this world', u'and it s in your control  what you do with it ', u'life has nothing against you  what you achieve', u'and what you do is a result of your own actions ', u'your feelings  the pleasantness that you create within yourself ', u'which to me was a very moving line', u'because it simplified a very extensive and expansive feeling of anxiety  fear', u'and all the turbulence that humanity goes through on a daily basis ', u'to me  three pillars of our existence are pretty much', u'family  fortune and farishta ', u'which is what i believe result of god  religion  everything else ', u'when we talk about family  sadhguru ', u'there are few things that have always intrigued me', u'and i seek answers', u'or rather validation from a higher energy such as yourself ', u'it s like i ve always questioned why there s an organic distance', u'between a father and son ', u'why there is always that angst in that relationship ', u'and i am sure there are many in this house', u'that have experienced that emotion in their own homes ', u'in their own environment ', u'where do you think the origin of that distance came ', u' because every generation makes the same mistake  ', u'which means they re not learning at all  ', u'when we say family', u'you know  in italy ', u'family meant crime ', u' crime ', u' yeah ', u'mafia was always referred to as the family ', u' family ', u' yes  so in a way  it s a kind of crime ', u'it is the most basic institution in the making of a society ', u'but it does not mean you must remain basic ', u'because this is a biological identity that we have ', u'biology is a reality  we can t deny it ', u'obviously this  was', u'in some way  at least to a certain extent ', u'our parents gave this  to us ', u'one part of it at least ', u'today the way it is ', u'the way it looks is essentially because of them ', u'well  it was given to them by somebody else ', u'that s another point ', u'but to us  it was given by them ', u'so it s a biological identity ', u'this limiting oneself to one s biological idetity', u'identity for an entire lifetime', u'is  is a crime', u'because it creates so many things ', u'in this country', u'this country has suffered a lot from a long time ', u'just now you released the mahabharat video ', u'entire mahabharat is family problem ', u'it is dhritarashtra syndrome ', u'we are still suffering  ', u' my son is best  no matter what ', u'even today we are suffering the same thing ', u' my son is best and he should become the king ', u'no matter what ', u'it s not just ', u' some sons haven t managed very well  some have  ', u' so  family is a basic identity that we are born with ', u'it s a wonderful thing when you are a child', u'because without that family support ', u'you wouldn t be who you are today in many ways  okay ', u'with all due respect and regard and great respect', u'for the family because', u'human creature is born in such a way', u'that as soon as you fall out of your mother s womb ', u'you are not ready get up on your feet and do things like other creatures ', u'it needs a long gestation period before', u'a man becomes a man or a woman becomes a woman ', u'there is a long period ', u'where the incubation of family is most important and vital ', u'there s no question about that ', u'but you re supposed to grow beyond that identity ', u'but a whole lot of people just never grow beyond that identity ', u'for which they suffer', u'and sometimes if they re born in certain places ', u'they make the entire nation suffer  ', u'you are supposed to grow out of that ', u'as a child  it s most vital that you are identified with the family ', u'but as an adult ', u'you re supposed to grow beyond your biology', u'because biology is the most basic identity ', u'one has to grow beyond that ', u'so having said that ', u'is it necessary that every father and every son has to have some kind of angst ', u'it is not about father and son ', u'it is just two men being accommodated in the same home  ', u'when you were eight  ten  your father was godlike ', u'so this problem started after you became fifteen  sixteen ', u'when you want to be a man and there s not enough space ', u'this big man is occupying too much space ', u'and that man thinks ', u' this is my space and who is this   ', u'they can t recognize each other as father and son because', u'now there are', u'there is no father and son ', u'there are two men in the same house', u'and there s not enough space ', u'this happens not in just human families ', u'every creature ', u'whether it s an elephant  or a buffalo  or whatever ', u'in every creature s life ', u'this happens that', u'there ll be some friction', u'and either the younger one goes out or the older one goes out ', u'this happens everywhere', u'because this is not a problem between father and son ', u'this is two men trying to share the same space', u'and the same woman called mother to one and wife to the other   ', u' two men ', u'well  that certainly breaks a strong myth', u'that this country has operated with', u'because the problem was always meant to be two women  in the same house', u'and you just changed it on its head  which i believe is true ', u'because i believe the problem lies in the fact that two men can t be accommodated ', u' no  it also happens between women in a different way ', u'but women have a way of covering their frictions in certain way ', u'they do it in a certain way  in a feminine way ', u'men will do it in more  ', u'head to  head on ', u'head butting is the man s way ', u'woman s way is different ', u'she will do it differently  but the friction happens ', u' and i feel it s always like the mother energy of the house', u'that sometimes has to bear the brunt of this tussle in a family ', u'it s also the other thing that', u'an offshoot of that thought is that i believe very strongly', u'that the people you love the most ', u'you kind of tend to dump all your anxieties  your angers ', u'your fears  your insecurities ', u'all onto that one source', u'that gives you the maximum love and the one that you love the most ', u'why is it that we as a human race tend to do that ', u'tend to lumber all our negative emotions on our most positive light source ', u' no  no  because if you try to dump it on someone on the street ', u'they ll smash you up  ', u' so', u' you are choosing a  a safe place ', u' but is that always fair ', u' first of all ', u'it s not fair for you to carry anxieties and angsts and angers and problems within you', u'because', u'see  if i try to torture you ', u'you have some defense against me ', u'either you will fight me  or you will run away ', u'or you ll do something ', u'you have some kind of defense ', u'but if you start torturing yourself ', u'this  is the most helpless creature ', u'no', u'most defenseless ', u'i m telling you  even an unborn child  if you poke like this  ', u'he responds ', u'he defends himself in his own little way  okay ', u'but this one  is completely defenseless ', u'when you start poking yourself ', u'this  is a completely defenseless life ', u'so the worst kind of torture ', u'the lowest level of mind is one who tortures himself ', u'but they always think', u'they are the highest level of people ', u' i suffer for everybody   ', u'you bloody suffer anyway  ', u'if there is everybody  you will dump it on them ', u'otherwise you ll simply suffer  ', u'people come to me and say ', u' sadhguru   i can t bear with my ', u'you know  my mother in law  she is impossible  ', u'my husband  after all  her son ', u'my wife  oh   she is terror for me ', u'my boss  he is not even human   ', u'like this  it goes on ', u'i tell them   you come  don t worry  i ll give you a nice place to stay ', u'i ll give you good food ', u'nothing to do ', u'for your life  i ll take care of you ', u'only thing is  i will make some random checks on you ', u'when i check  you must be joyful ', u'if you re miserable ', u'i don t believe in feeding misery   ', u'so  you leave them in one place for twenty four hours ', u'you will see how they will mess themselves up ', u'so when you re alone ', u'if you re miserable  you are obviously in bad company  ', u'now you are thinking ', u' because of this person  i am suffering ', u'because of that person  i am suffering ', u'just stay alone by yourself ', u'without any entertainment ', u'without texting ', u'without television ', u'without reading ', u'simply sit in one place', u'joyfully  let me see ', u'most people can t stay there for five minutes  believe me ', u'they are not on facebook ', u'they are not on twitter ', u'they re not this thing', u'because they have something to say or because they have fallen in love with the world  ', u'no ', u'if they stay alone  they ll go crazy  that s a fact ', u' what is  i mean  sorry to break that train of thought ', u'but what is the solution to that kind of feeling', u'of just not enjoying your own space ', u' because we have not looked at how human mechanism works ', u'it is like you have a super sophisticated machine', u'this  the super super computer out of', u'this  is the machine  which dripped super computers  isn t it ', u'i am asking  have you read the user s manual  ', u'that s all it is ', u'the entire yogic system is just this ', u'this is not a philosophy ', u'this is not an ideology ', u'this is not a religion ', u'this is not a teaching ', u'this is just the user s manual ', u'how to', u'how your body should sit ', u'how it must breathe ', u'how the mind should be ', u'how the emotions should be ', u'how the energy should be ', u'what are the things you can do with it ', u'how should you keep it so that this ', u'will function at its highest possible level ', u'see  the cellphone companies have been doing some research a few years ago', u'and they found', u'only seven percent', u'or only three percent of the people', u'no ', u'ninety seven percent of the people are using only seven percent of the cellphone s capability ', u'we are not even talking about today s smartphones ', u'we re talking about the dumb phones ', u'so ninety seven percent of the people are using only seven percent of a small gadget ', u'if that is the fact ', u'how much do you believe are people making use of this tremendous gadget  ', u'just on the surface because they are never bothered to read the user s manual ', u'if you tell them this  they say ', u' sadhguru  can you give us the user s manual ', u'it s written into you ', u'you have to spend some time with this   ', u'this was written by the source of creation ', u'not by me or you  isn t it ', u'you must learn to read ', u'the problem is illiteracy ', u'see  suppose you are  you do not  you have not learnt the alphabet ', u'well  you have learnt english alphabet ', u'let s say i ll give you a tamil book ', u'you look at it  does it make any sense to you ', u'you don t know the alphabet  it doesn t make a  doesn t mean a thing to you', u'because you do not know the alphabet ', u'now  this is the problem  that in today s society ', u'in modern education ', u'we have not even brought fundamental literacy', u'towards how to read this book  ', u'because we ve never read this  ', u'by accident we are managing it ', u'if you manage by accident  sometimes it works ', u'sometimes it doesn t work ', u'one moment you are happy ', u'next moment you are miserable ', u'one moment you are peaceful ', u'another moments you are in turmoil ', u'i was    you know ', u'i ll cut the long story short  ', u'i was in tel aviv and somebody came and greeted me ', u' shalom ', u'i said   what does that mean ', u'he said   this is the highest way of greeting ', u'i said   that s your opinion but what does it mean ', u'he said   no  no  no  this is really the highest way of greeting ', u'i said   all right but what does the word mean ', u'he said   it means peace ', u'then i say ', u' why is peace the highest way of greeting unless you are born in middle east   ', u'in south india ', u'you come up to me in the morning and say   peace ', u'i will ask   what s wrong with you   ', u'i am saying if you deprive yourself of something for a long time ', u'suddenly it becomes godlike ', u'if you have not eaten for ten days ', u'even if god appeared ', u'what s the prayer  ', u'food  of course ', u'so ', u'once you deprive yourself of fundamental things', u'i am saying fundamental things because', u'to be peaceful and joyful is not the ultimate goal of life ', u'if you want to enjoy your meal  you must be peaceful and joyful ', u'if you want to enjoy your friend  you must be peaceful and joyful ', u'if you want to enjoy your walk on the street  you must be peaceful and joyful ', u'if you want to enjoy simple things that you do in your life ', u'you must be at least peaceful and joyful  if not ecstatic ', u'so it is a most fundamental requirement ', u'this is not happening ', u'people are saying this is the ultimate goal of life ', u'even so called spiritual leaders are saying ', u' peace is the ultimate goal of life ', u'such people will only rest in peace  ', u' in what i believe surrounds us all is urban angst  ', u'i think that seems to be terminology that comes out of mental health solutions  et cetera ', u'and that seems to be rampant in many parts of the world now ', u'including now slowly penetrating even in india ', u'when people deal with mental health issues', u'like depression and anxiety ', u'and those  seek certain chemical imbalance issues that are told to them about', u' hey  they re making you look very pretty on the screen ', u'how do they do that ', u'they re not doing it to me  ', u' they are making my what  my  ', u' look at yourself there ', u' am i looking pretty on screen ', u' yeah  yeah  see ', u' okay  ', u' they re not doing that to me  ', u' you are actually looking stunning to me  sir  ', u' stunning is another word for shocking  ', u' well  i was trying to find another adjective to counter that  ', u'but back to me and my mental health issue  ', u'i really want to know ', u'it s such an order of the day today ', u'everyone seems to kind  it s almost', u'and i hate to say this with any', u'and i don t say this with any kind of disrespect to people s personal circumstance ', u'but i almost feel like today it s talked about', u'like it s almost a fashionable issue ', u'where i think it s a very serious issue ', u'when people talk about mental health issues', u'like depression and anxiety', u'and seek counseling to sort those issues out ', u'and then the diagnosis at times is chemical imbalance', u'and medication is given ', u'what', u'and then your', u'well  i know you hate the word philosophy ', u'but all your teachings are definitely about finding yourself', u'and seeking that pleasantness from within ', u'but to those who are not strong enough to achieve that and seek this assistance ', u'what is your take on that ', u' let me correct one more thing in the question ', u'this is', u'this is not a teaching ', u'this is just a technology ', u'i am just giving people simple methods', u'with which they can work ', u'if people are coming for a teaching ', u'they re frustrated with me', u'because every time they come  they leave more confused than ever before  ', u'if they look', u'if they are more confused  in a way my job is done', u'because ', u'my entire work is to get them out of silly conclusions ', u'that they have made about life ', u'and confusion means you are still looking ', u'you have an active intelligence ', u'conclusions means', u'what is the conclusion of your life ', u'hello ', u'what is the conclusion of your life ', u'you don t know ', u'let me reveal the suspense to you ', u'though as a filmmaker he won t tell you till the end  ', u'i will reveal it to you', u' sometimes we don t even know what happens after that so  ', u'many of us are confused souls when we make movies ', u' so  the conclusion of your life is you ll be dead  ', u'you think something else is going to happen to you  ', u'you ll be just dead  that s all is the conclusion ', u'so every time you make a conclusion ', u'in some way you die  you need to understand this ', u'you kill something of yourself every time you make a conclusion ', u'this is you in a state of committing suicide in installments ', u'you may call this religion ', u'you may call this philosophy ', u'you may call this being socially whatever ', u'but fundamentally you re committing suicide in installments ', u'this is why', u'when you look at a child and yourself ', u'you are less alive than a child ', u'as you grow up  should you become more alive or less alive ', u'unfortunately  most adults are less alive than children  isn t it ', u'you must be more alive', u'but unfortunately you re less alive ', u'maybe your physical agility will go down with age', u'but your aliveness need not go down ', u'aliveness is going down because', u'you re continuously making conclusions and conclusions and conclusions ', u'as you conclude  you become less and less alive ', u'you know that there is that famous parable ', u'which is all over the place ', u'about adam and eve ', u'it seems god told them', u'it s a dumb couple ', u' kind of  ', u'look at what we had to suffer as a result of them  ', u' no  no  not because of that ', u'because they didn t know what to do with each other  ', u'so  god told them ', u' you eat whatever you want  but don t eat from this particular tree ', u'you know what tree that was ', u' apple ', u' no  apple means in old english just a fruit ', u' knowledge ', u' what  knowledge ', u'your parents tell you  you must eat the fruit of knowledge ', u'your teachers insist that you must eat the fruit of knowledge ', u'everybody in the society', u'always trying to shove knowledge down your throat ', u'but in  it seems god told you not to eat the fruit of knowledge', u'and by eating that ', u'that adam and eve fell ', u'it is not about that adam and that eve ', u'it s about every adam and every eve ', u'the moment you eat the fruit of knowledge  you fall', u'because your idea of a knowledge is', u'the conclusions that you make about everything in the universe  ', u'so this mental illness which is becoming pandemic', u'they are telling me  ', u"i don't know how far these statistics are right  ", u'they are telling me', u'over forty people  particularly women in america ', u'over forty years of age ', u'nearly fifty two percent of them are on some kind of antidepressants ', u'fifty two percent is not a joke ', u'fifty two percent is not a joke  ', u'it means entire humanity is becoming sick ', u'we must look at it  why ', u'fundamentally ', u'because you are banking on a few things for a long time', u'for your mental stability and emotional stability ', u'all these things are taken away ', u'one thing is  as you mentioned', u'the crime that we call as family ', u'it gave us the support ', u'no matter what happened  there was somebody always for you ', u'others are with you when you do the right things ', u'if you do the wrong thing  they ll distance themselves ', u'there was one bunch of people ', u'who was like a  for the circus that you do ', u'they were the net ', u'whichever way you fall ', u'there s somebody to hold you for some moments ', u'but that net is gone ', u'now when you fall  you fall ', u'because of that  people are cracking up ', u'so if you want to remove', u'see  in this culture ', u'there was a time in the tradition ', u'where thirty percent of india s population were monks ', u'that means consciously they went beyond family ', u'consciously they chose to live without family ', u'to live without support ', u'to live without a home ', u'homelessness not out of deprivation but by choice ', u'nobody ever had a depression ', u'because they transcended the need for the net ', u'you learnt your trapeze bar act really well ', u'now you can do it without the net ', u'you are not good at it  you better have a net  isn t it  ', u'otherwise your head will crack ', u'right now  that s all that s happening ', u'the traditional support system that we had ', u'we re taking it off ', u'when we talked about religion ', u'with all due respect  we must acknowledge this ', u'today people are trying to go to psychiatrists ', u'india doesn t have enough psychiatrists for one billion people  believe me ', u'no country has  and above all  they re very inefficient', u'because they can take only one client at a time', u'and they need lot of furniture like this  ', u'it s very inefficient ', u'religion handled human psychological balance effortlessly ', u' god is with you  don t worry ', u'it settled a whole lot of people ', u'do not underestimate the value of that ', u'it is very inexpensive mass psychiatry ', u'where people ', u'no people', u'no  no  i m not', u'this is not a joke ', u'when you are mentally ill  it s not a joke ', u'it s a most painful thing ', u'if you get physical ailments  you will get everybody s compassion ', u'when you get mental ailment  you ll get laughter  you know  unfortunately ', u'because you don t know when somebody is sick', u'and when somebody is being stupid  tch ', u'you can t make out ', u'this is the biggest problem', u'for those families  who have somebody in the family  who is mentally disturbed ', u'you don t know when they are making it up ', u'when they are really suffering ', u'you can t make out ', u'there is no perfect way ', u'there is no science anywhere to tell you exactly when', u'because human beings can make up every kind of thing ', u'you are an actor  you know ', u"i don't know  you  you are actor or ", u' i do most things  yeah ', u' okay  ', u' we act even in our day to day existence  all of us do  ', u' no  that is fine  but are you actor  just director ', u' no  no  i tried  i failed  ', u' okay  so  all right  you are a bad actor  ', u' yeah ', u'but i am an actor nonetheless ', u' but at least you make other people act ', u' yes ', u' so  you know  in a cinema or drama  you can act something', u'and make it really real to a point ', u'where these 10000 people will sit and experience like it s real ', u'so  when a mentally ill person is in your home ', u'you don t know whether he s acting it up or it s real ', u'sometimes it s real ', u'sometimes he s playing with it ', u'you can t make out ', u'you don t know when to be compassionate ', u'when to be hard on him ', u'this is the biggest problem for people  who have mentally ill', u'people in  within their homes ', u'this is the huge problem', u'because there is no perfect way of making a judgment ', u'and it is not joke ', u'see  human sanity is a very fragile thing ', u'the line between sanity and insanity is so thin ', u'if you push it every day  you will cross it ', u'see  when you get angry  what do you say ', u'what s the expression ', u' i am mad with you  or  i am mad right now ', u'so you are enjoying that little bit of madness ', u'you crossed the line and it felt like', u'it s some kind of a freedom and power ', u'but one day when you cannot cross back ', u'that is when suffering begins ', u'and suffering means ', u'it s not like physical pain ', u'it s immense suffering ', u'i have been around people who have been mentally ill ', u'trying to help them ', u'it is', u'nobody should have it ', u'but unfortunately  it s becoming an epidemic in the world ', u'that mental illnesses are growing like never before', u'because all the supports they had we are pulling it out', u'without replacing it ', u'if people become so conscious and so capable within themselves ', u'you pull all the supports  everything will be fine ', u'but without giving that competence ', u'you just pull the supports ', u'people will crack ', u'in the western societies  it s happening large scale ', u'we are not going to be far behind ', u'especially the urban societies in india will move in this direction', u'because once again in many ways ', u'urban india is more west than west ', u'there are more people in denims here than in america  ', u' well  no  thank you  thank you for that', u'because i know it is definitely a crisis that plagues us', u'and some  as i said  seek help ', u'some who are helped ', u'i am happy for them and i am sure grateful for resources that are available ', u'and those that find pleasantness within themselves ', u'i think that truly is a glorious solution to their issues', u' see  when we say pleasantness ', u'human pleasantness can be looked at in many different ways ', u'one simple way of looking at it  ', u'because medical science is looking at it that way ', u'i don t see it that way ', u'but that s a consequence for me', u'  is every human experience has a chemical basis to it ', u'what you call as peace  joy  love  turmoil  tranquility  agony  ecstasy ', u'everything has a chemical balance  chemical basis to it ', u'even health and ill health has a chemical basis to it ', u'today entire pharmacology is just about', u'trying to manage your health by using chemicals ', u'it s a  today or  a doctor s or a physician s job is ', u'it s an orchestra of chemistry that he s trying to manage ', u'put this pill  something more happened ', u'put that pill ', u'then something less happened  then do this  do that  ', u'trying to manage the orchestra of chemistry because', u'this  is the most complex chemical factory on the planet ', u'this  is a very complex chemical factory ', u'managing it from outside is  very  very difficult ', u'but you could manage it from inside ', u'but you must have access to your insides', u'if your innards are not available to you ', u'then how do you manage it from inside ', u'you only try to manage it from outside ', u'all  even mental illness is a largely being managed by chemical input ', u'but all the chemicals that you can think of on this planet', u'are in some way already present in this  ', u'whether you are seeking medically prescribed drugs', u'or you re going for the backstreet drugs ', u'whatever you are going ', u'essentially you are trying to bring pleasantness within yourself', u'because health means one level of pleasantness ', u'if  if body becomes pleasant  we call this health ', u'if it becomes very pleasant  we call this pleasure ', u'if your mind becomes pleasant  we call this peace ', u'if it becomes very pleasant  we call this joy ', u'if your emotions become pleasant  you call this love ', u'if it becomes very pleasant  we call it compassion ', u'if your very energies become pleasant  we call this bliss ', u'if it becomes very pleasant  we call it ecstasy ', u'if your surroundings become pleasant  we call this success  ', u'so  we are trying to manage pleasantness by putting chemicals ', u'to what extent means  ', u'these statistics are out now  ', u'in united states ', u'they are saying seventy percent of the population', u'is on some kind of prescription medication ', u'the  most affluent country  where there is enormous choice of nourishment', u'and lifestyles ', u'here seventy percent are on prescription medication ', u'so you are trying to manage your sanity and your health', u'by putting chemicals from outside ', u'but there is no doubt in anybody s mind today', u'that this  is the greatest chemical factory', u'  but right now ill managed ', u'essentially  you are a lousy ceo  ', u' that is true ', u'what has always  sadhguru  has also left me in wonderment at times about', u'the usage of two words ', u'which i am going to say it to you right now ', u'terminology sometimes has a tendency of making you', u'even receive an emotion from within ', u'two words being ego and self respect ', u'now these are two pillars of ', u'what we believe is self confidence ', u'which is unfounded  i believe ', u'ego', u' hey  who put a cow next to me  ', u' sorry ', u' who put a cow next to me ', u' put a ', u'well  topical at least  ', u'it s part of the d cor or something ', u' because everywhere i go ', u'people have been asking me questions about gau rakshak ', u'gau rakshak  ', u'now they put a cow next to me  ', u' well  i was planning not to go down that path but now ', u'then since you brought it up ', u'no  no  not going there ', u'as i was saying about ego and self respect ', u'like we always say ', u'like my belief has always been that maintain your self respect  keep that ', u'your ego can be flexible', u'because it should be convenient ', u'because i believe like your ego should be a function of your convenience  ', u'how true is that or maybe both are unfounded ', u' this ego should be a function of your convenience is perfect ', u'but nobody knows where ego is within themselves ', u'do you know ', u' no ', u' nobody knows ', u' it arises at will  i think ', u' no  no  no  ego is a fall guy ', u'when you do the good things  it s of course it s you who did it ', u'when you do nasty things', u' oh  it was my ego ', u'he is a fall guy ', u'he comes up whenever something goes wrong  ', u'whenever you are seen in a bad light ', u' it was my ego  it s not me ', u'so  people have created a whole', u'lot of jargon like this ', u' my ego  my self ', u'my consciousness ', u'my super consciousness  many things ', u'first everybody must decide', u'within this body of yours  how many people are residing  you must tell me  ', u'if there is anything more than one ', u'it means you  either you are schizophrenic or you are possessed  ', u'you need either a psychiatrist or an exorcist  ', u'so you are an individual ', u'an individual means not further divisible  ', u'indivisible ', u'this is why you are an individual ', u'that means there is only one ', u'this is the healthiest state to be  that you understand', u'there is only you here ', u'nobody else but you ', u'if you realize this ', u'then you will function completely differently ', u'but you start playing this game  ', u'whenever you are in difficulty  you say   it was my ego ', u'whenever something else happens  you say   it s myself ', u'another time you say   my lower self  higher self   ', u'all kinds of stuff ', u'many identities within you ', u'see  this is the nature of a criminal   alias  alias  alias  alias  you know ', u'so  it s a crime that you started ', u'whether you will be caught in the web of that or you will manage doing', u'see  if you do minimal amount of crime  you may manage ', u'only when you really get into it ', u'then you may get into the web ', u'otherwise  many people commit small time crime', u'and then become very respectable in the society  ', u'so  if you do little crime of ego business  self business ', u'all this and then become normal  you re okay ', u'but if you play it too much ', u'you will become mentally ill ', u'because if there is more than one in this  ', u'you will become sick ', u'there you are an individual  you are just one ', u'now it s very easy to transform this  ', u'you can t transform a crowd of people ', u'you can only transform individual people  ', u'and if you take away this fall guy ', u'one fundamental thing you have to do with yourself is', u'to see that no matter what happens in my life ', u'if pleasant things happen ', u'if unpleasant things happen ', u'whether i am joyful or miserable ', u'i m successful or a failure ', u'you know it s just you ', u'you and you alone ', u'otherwise  when things happen well   me ', u'when things don t happen well ', u' so you say we always tend to blame ourselves into various parts', u'and then divine forces as well ', u' it s convenient ', u'it s very convenient ', u'but this self respect  ', u'no  no  you should have no self respect ', u'others ', u'respect is from another person ', u' i respect myself   ', u'what is this rubbish  ', u'somebody else respects you because they see some value to you  it s nice  ', u'but  i respect myself    what is this ', u'this is ', u'this is  it s gone further in the west', u'and people say   i love myself ', u'see  to respect  to love ', u'the very word they are using is', u'there must be two ', u'you can love somebody ', u'somebody can love you ', u'you can respect somebody  somebody can respect you ', u'but  i love myself  i respect myself ', u'this terminology is the terminology of the insane ', u'but it s becoming popular', u'because the numbers are growing  ', u' by the hour  ', u' hey  don t say by the hour  ', u'then we will be blamed  ', u'by the day  ', u' by the day  okay  we get that ', u'we sign seal and deliver that  ', u'is there a ceiling to extremity ', u'to extreme emotion like love ', u'when you love something ', u'is there a time that you have to stop ', u'is there any such thing as stopping the extent of your extreme emotion ', u'and i feel that about even the negative emotions ', u'when you love someone ', u'how do you really stop the extent of it ', u' i would say', u'please  i want you to listen to this carefully because', u'you will immediately tweet ', u' sadhguru said this   ', u'it s a dangerous world today ', u'if you love  love strong ', u'if you hate  hate strong ', u'whatever the hell you do  live strong ', u'it s very important ', u'otherwise  you will live an insipid life  ', u'not knowing a thing about anything ', u'in', u'when adiyogi gave the yogic principles ', u'he said anything in your life ', u'it doesn t matter what', u'i have been telling people  they re not grasping it ', u'they think ', u'because too much this  you know  what to say ', u'flowery teachings have gone into people ', u'they re not looking at what works and what doesn t work ', u'they want something pretty ', u'i am not interested in what s pretty and not pretty ', u'whether it works or not is the only thing ', u'ultimately  what works is very fantastic  ', u'so  even if it s anger  ', u'not necessarily love or compassion ', u'even if it is anger   just stay on it for twenty four hours ', u'anybody  i m saying just try this by yourself ', u'twenty four hours stay intensely angry  let me see ', u'believe me  at the end of twenty four hours or well before that ', u'you will be enlightened ', u'but you will see you are not capable of being angry', u'because to stay intensely angry ', u'you need enormous energy ', u'it burns you up ', u'try one day ', u'twenty four hours stay angry ', u'you are irritated  that you can manage for the rest of your life  ', u'stay angry  really super angry for twenty four hours ', u'let me see ', u'you can t manage more than three minutes  believe me ', u'you will feel drained out because it takes enormous energy ', u'there are yogis  who live like this ', u'they are simply angry all the time ', u'all the time  not about anybody or anything ', u'simply angry  just like that ', u'it works wonderfully ', u'it works much better and quicker than love ', u'only thing is ', u'with that kind of practice within you ', u'with that kind of emotion within you ', u'you can t live in social atmospheres ', u'you ll have to withdraw to a mountain cave', u'and simply be angry about nothing ', u'just like that ', u'if you want to live in social atmospheres ', u'you need to be in a pleasant state of emotion ', u'otherwise you will get into constant mess ', u'so  should i stop myself somewhere ', u'what you are asking is ', u' should i be constipated about my love   ', u'at least in love  know some sense of abandon ', u'that there is no brakes on it ', u'i would say on everything in your life', u'in your car  you must pull out all the pedals ', u'only throttle should be there ', u'yes ', u'in your life  there should be only throttle', u'because brake will happen when you die ', u'it s not for you to brake every day  ', u'it s not for you to control ', u'your life will be curtailed somewhere ', u'that s nature s business ', u'your business is to be full on because', u'life  life needs your support ', u'death is super efficient ', u'did you ever see death happening inefficiently ', u'hello  ', u'wherever it happened it was a perfect death  isn t it  ', u'never happened inefficiently', u'but life happens inefficiently ', u'life needs constant support ', u'death does not need your support ', u'stopping something is death in a way ', u'so to love  you re afraid ', u'to laugh  you re afraid ', u'to cry you re afraid ', u'to everything ', u'nothing is done with abandon  everything with constipation  ', u'learn to do something with abandon because', u'if you do not know at least how to scream in abandon ', u'there is no way you will ever know how to meditate', u'or to be spiritual ', u'because spirituality is a state of total abandon ', u'complete state of abandon  ', u' i endorse that', u'and i will try and live by that ', u'but what happens when a positive emotion reaches its extreme stage ', u'and ventures into a dark area ', u'like love can also transfer itself into obsession ', u' see ', u'you are referring to', u'see  it s like this ', u'suppose you don t have legs', u'and if i say   come  dance ', u'you say   no  i cannot even walk without my crutch ', u'so  i cannot walk without my crutch ', u'or  i cannot live without you  are not different ', u'this is a very dangerous territory i am entering  ', u'but it is a fact ', u' i cannot walk without a crutch ', u'or  i cannot live without you  is the same thing', u'because you re misunderstanding your dependence', u'and a certain relationship that you hold with somebody as love ', u'let s look at this thing of what is love ', u'see  it s a certain blossoming within you ', u'now  who are you in your life ', u'who are you using as the manure ', u'filth ', u'see  this flower is fragrant ', u'not because somebody sprayed perfume to the roots ', u'it is fragrant because somebody put filth to the roots  isn t it ', u'so now  you found a little flower within you of love ', u'who is your manure ', u'who is your filth ', u'now this is a dangerous territory for me to enter with you also  ', u'but this is exactly what we are doing ', u'now the question is just this ', u'whatever is the most pleasant emotion within you ', u'are you capable of bringing it on by yourself ', u'or are you in a dilapidated condition of technology ', u'that you are a push start machine ', u'that somebody has to push you ', u'otherwise you cannot be ', u'your joy  your love  your peace  your ecstasy', u'must be your making  isn t it ', u'so now  your love will become about sharing your joy ', u'not squeezing joy out of somebody ', u'right now  most people s joy  most people s idea of a love affair', u'is more like a mutual benefit scheme  ', u' you give me this  i ll give you that ', u'you can t live without me  i can t live without you ', u'they will make sure that the other person also becomes invalid', u'and cannot live without me ', u'yes ', u'this is a very  a very huge problem in the human societies ', u'love is not happening as a flowering ', u'it is something that we are trying to suck out of somebody ', u'love is not about somebody ', u'i want you to know this ', u'maybe because you re a film personality maybe', u'you said you are not an actor but', u'there are many actors  who are loved by people ', u'people are in  drooling with ecstasy simply looking at them ', u'but the problem is they ve never seen them ', u'they ve only seen that play of light and sound ', u'they ve never seen them but they love them ', u'so what i am saying is ', u'you are capable of loving somebody  that person may not exist ', u'he may be animated ', u'but you still love and you are experiencing all the fruits of love ', u'i am saying  love is something that you do within yourself', u'and blame it on somebody  ', u'you can do it by yourself ', u'for a long time in this country  it s been there ', u'there have been meerabais and tukarams and others ', u'they taught you  you don t have  to love and to be in an extreme state of love ', u'you don t need anybody ', u'you can simply do it by yourself ', u'and not just in emotion ', u'even physical ecstasies happened to them ', u'simply because they are in a great love affair', u'with someone who is not even here  all right ', u'so  it is something that you do within yourself ', u'right now  you are in love with somebody here ', u'that somebody may not even know that you love them ', u'but you can experience this  isn t it ', u'you don t need the support from the other person ', u'this is an experience that s happening within you ', u'love is within you if you wish ', u'it is not that it s sitting within you ', u'there is no such thing ', u'you are capable of variety of emotions ', u"if you want  you can make it's very sweet emotion ", u'if you are in a very sweet state of emotion ', u'people say   oh  he s very loving ', u'you may not be loving in the real context of how they understand ', u'but you are in a pleasant state of emotion ', u'so naturally you do pleasant things ', u'so people think you love them ', u' so make love an island  not a country ', u' no  no  make love the universe  not an island  ', u'because right now  when you say  i love you ', u'this particular person  you only ', u'when i look at these people  i look at them like this  ', u'this one person  ahh  ', u'this is an island love  ', u'it is too discriminatory ', u'this one face in these 10000 faces i love ', u'rest   depressing looking at them ', u'this is a very island love ', u'i know you are in an island city ', u'but it s time ', u' to go beyond ', u'  it s time that you understand', u'love is a happening within you ', u'maybe somebody stimulated this ', u'you are grateful for them', u'that they ignited this within you ', u'but love affair is yours  isn t it ', u'it s an inner experience that s happening to you ', u'somebody is providing the stimulus ', u'we are grateful to them  that they are providing this ', u'but they are not causing it ', u'it s been caused from within ', u'and once you understand this ', u'why wouldn t you be walking on the street lovingly ', u'why wouldn t you look at a tree lovingly ', u'why wouldn t you look at a buffalo lovingly ', u'why wouldn t you look at the cloud lovingly ', u'because it is not something that ll get over ', u' should i control it ', u'why ', u'will it get over ', u'there is no such danger ', u'it doesn t get over ', u'in fact  almost everything that you experience ', u'the more you exercise it  the more it s available to you ', u'whether it s your love  or joy  or hate  or anger ', u'the more you exercise it  the more it s available to you', u'because it s after all your making ', u'it s entirely your making ', u'so when it s your making ', u'why don t you enjoy it every moment of your life ', u'somebody is there  nobody is there ', u'what is the problem  ', u' well  that brings me to  i think the', u'i believe the mother of a virus that plagues a large part of humanity is expectation ', u'i have a simple theory that i try to expect less', u'because then i feel that i ll be disappointed less  ', u'and i feel to curtail your expectation is possibly the toughest thing to do', u'because we constantly expect from relationships ', u'from the work we do  from ', u' you are just talking to the wrong guy about this expectation  ', u'i have the highest expectation of every human being on the planet ', u'and i know  and i know they will disappoint me ', u'i will die disappointed but joyfully disappointed  ', u' now joyful disappointment is a place  sir  that you ve reached  ', u'but that is not a easy place to reach for most of us ', u' no  no  no ', u'see  these things are not like that ', u'to be joyful or miserable is essentially your choice ', u'it s a choice that you are making within yourself ', u'maybe it s an unconscious choice ', u'anything that you do unconsciously', u'right now  unconsciously my hand can fly ', u'but what i can do unconsciously ', u'i can do the same thing definitely consciously also  isn t it  tch ', u'this is the fundamental difference between being human and every other creature ', u'we are not doing anything different from what they are doing ', u'we are doing the same things ', u'but we do it little more consciously ', u'suddenly it s a different affair altogether ', u'same things  ', u'we eat  they eat ', u'they sleep  we sleep ', u'they reproduce  we reproduce ', u'they die  we die ', u'only thing is we are doing it little more consciously ', u'suddenly it looks like another world by itself ', u'we think we are above them', u'only because we can do the same silly little things little more consciously ', u'so  if i can move my hand unconsciously ', u'i can also move it consciously ', u'if i can become joyful unconsciously ', u'i can also become joyful consciously ', u'if i am joyful because of my choice ', u'suppose disappointments are thrown at me ', u'i will be joyfully disappointed  ', u'and my expectations of people are very  very high ', u'i have an impossible expectation ', u'so i know i will die joyfully  blissfully disappointed', u'because i know the nature of the world very well ', u'i am not somebody who lives in fancy la la land  ', u' so  abundant love and no curtail on expectation ', u' oh', u'see  love is not a quantity  it s a quality ', u'it is not that if you do certain amount of things  you are loving ', u'there is no such thing ', u'you can sit here  eyes closed  not look at anybody', u'and still be loving because', u'it s essentially pleasantness of your emotion ', u'how pleasant ', u'i am asking  is there any need to curtail pleasantness within you ', u'now i am super pleasant ', u'but if a child came ', u'i may grab him and put him on my lap ', u'if an adult comes  you don t do that  ', u'i ll do this   okay ', u'here dog came  i ll just do this  ', u'but an adult comes  another person comes  you don t do this  to them ', u'i am saying your expression will change from person to person ', u'from relationship to relationship ', u'what kind of intimacy and what kind of closeness you have with people ', u'but does it mean to say that you should not this ', u'with as much love as you hug somebody or kiss somebody ', u'should you not ', u'should you not do namaskaram with as much love as you hugged your child ', u'why not  i am asking ', u'because there is no', u'see  this  i m  i m trying to demolish the word abundance because', u'when you say abundance  there is also scarcity ', u'there is no such thing ', u'it is neither abundant nor scarce ', u'if you are willing  it s on ', u'if you are not willing  it s off  that s all  ', u' as simple as that  ', u'fundamentally  there is always a need ', u'a need for so many things ', u'even when  in your process ', u'your professional process or where you garner wealth or income', u'and you keep going ', u'there is a need to constantly get more than what you have ', u'there is no satisfaction and a place to stop ', u'is there an end to need ', u' no  no  no ', u'there should not be an end ', u'it is just that', u'now that you are asking this question ', u'in some way you have realized that at every point of your life ', u'you thought   this is it  if this one thing happens  i am fulfilled ', u'but the very next day you realize that this is not it  there is one more thing and one more thing ', u'and you know that after ten years still the same state will continue ', u'so this means you are ready for yoga  ', u'this means you have understood that your longing is not for more ', u'your longing is for all ', u'your longing to expand is not just for more  it is for all ', u'or in other words ', u'your longing is in some way for infinite expansion ', u'if you handle your infinite expansion unconsciously', u'and if it finds a very basic physical expression ', u'we call this sexuality ', u'what you are trying to do is ', u'something that is not you ', u'with physical contact you are trying to make it a part of yourself ', u'you know it doesn t work ', u'if you try emotionally  we call this love ', u'emotionally you are trying to include something which is not you as a part of yourself ', u'this is your love affair ', u'if you do it mentally  this gets labeled as greed ', u'ambition  conquest or simply shopping  ', u'if you do it consciously  then we call this yoga ', u'yoga means union ', u'you re longing to expand infinitely', u'but because of little constipation in the head ', u'you are going in installments ', u'can you go in installments and become infinite  i am asking ', u'is it possible ', u'can you count one  two  three  four and one day say infinity ', u'no  you will become endless counting ', u'so your longing is not for this much or that much ', u'your longing is for everything ', u'if you want everything  you must understand that', u'you cannot do that physically ', u'it can only happen in a dimension beyond physical', u'because physicality exists only because of defined boundaries ', u'but there is something within you  which doesn t like this boundary ', u'which wants to stretch the boundary ', u'stretch the boundary ', u'stretch the boundary ', u'you are looking for boundlessness ', u'but you are not courageous enough or conscious enough to admit this ', u'you want to go in installments ', u'no  what you are looking is for boundlessness ', u'if you want boundlessness ', u'it can never ever happen through physical means ', u'so once it doesn t happen through physical means ', u'now you use the most corrupted word called spiritual ', u'spiritual does not mean looking up or looking down ', u'going here  going there ', u'it simply means your experience of life transcended the limitations of being just physical ', u'because everything that s physical about you is an acquired quantity  isn t it ', u'this is just a piece of this planet ', u'what is up here is just a heap of impressions that you have gathered ', u'so what you have acquired can be yours ', u'can never be you ', u'so this longing to have more money ', u'more property ', u'more pleasure ', u'more something is not about those things ', u'you are trying to find that dimension beyond physical nature ', u'but because of constipation  it s not happening   ', u' i m going to take the liberty  sadhguru ', u'to do what i normally do on my television show ', u'which is a rapid fire round ', u' mhmm   ', u' the  normally the end of this round', u'  see  i ve  when i was young ', u'i watched a lot of  you know ', u'wild west movies  ', u'when you fire  i also fire  all right  ', u' no  but i promise you ', u'this is not that kind of', u'you are not in my line of fire  at all ', u'i will not take the liberty of being that person  ', u'these are just quick questions  which when i ask for one word ', u'you have to stick to that', u'because sometimes you have a tendency of not exactly answering the question asked  ', u'but you give such a profound and prolific retort back', u'that it makes you very satiated ', u'but in this case ', u'my only request is that if it s one word ', u'then it s just one word  ', u' okay ', u' and the end of this normally ', u'you get a hamper  ', u'but in the absence of a hamper here ', u'you already have', u' a cow  ', u'  something right  yes ', u'so   and  or this beautiful bouquet that is right next to you ', u'but so there is no hamper', u'but you do will get my utmost gratitude  ', u'thank you ', u' all right  very simply ', u'what is the one thing that is essential to living a balanced life ', u' sense  ', u' what is the one thing we must absolutely do away with in order to lead a balanced life ', u' senselessness  ', u' all right ', u'i thought that was coming ', u'first thing that comes to your mind when i say the following  ', u'the first thing  organized religion ', u' madness ', u' marriage ', u' cohabitation  ', u' competition ', u' stupid ', u' money ', u' useful ', u' love ', u' can i say a sentence  ', u' yes ', u'i will allow that  ', u' most beautiful but unfortunately crippling for most people  ', u'if i can little elaborate that', u'see  if something unpleasant cripples you ', u'something nasty cripples you  tch ', u'it s acceptable ', u'when something beautiful cripples you ', u'it s a true disaster   ', u' if you could ask one person alive or dead ', u'one question ', u'who would you ask and what would that be  ', u' i really sorted out all my questions', u'because i did not spend time educating myself or doing anything ', u'i spent my entire life sorting out every damn question i had ', u'i kind of run out of questions  ', u' and you certainly have not run out of any answers ', u'and you never will ', u'best advice you have ever received ', u' nothing ', u' never ', u' no  i never sought  nor did i receive ', u'i made myself in such a way ', u'i m incapable either of seeking advice or giving advice  ', u' in an imaginary ', u'completely hypothetical situation ', u'if you had a day off with no commitments ', u'no responsibilities ', u'what would you spend the day doing ', u' oh  there re lot of things ', u"this can't be one word  ", u' no  it s not one word ', u' see  i have an indiscriminate sense of passion towards everything ', u'there were lots and lots of things i did at one time', u'but these days  time is not allowing me to do that ', u'so generally if i have little time  all i do is play golf', u'because that s safe and within the city and i can get back in time for something else to be done ', u'but if an entire day is left to me  ', u'which they have not done for a long time  ', u'they ve not left it to me  ', u'if that happens  i will close my eyes and sit', u'because that is my  the best  the best ', u'i am at my best when i truly have nothing to do  ', u' what is one thing you d like people to remember about you at the end of your life ', u' they must live so wonderfully that they don t even remember me  ', u' if you found a way to travel through time  where would you go ', u' i m kind of done with all those things  ', u' you re universe visited already ', u'you have visas for every part  of this ecosystem ', u' if we can do some slow fire ', u' yeah ', u'  because that s a question with many ramifications ', u'this ', u'for example  traveling in the world ', u'we ve jetted around and now we want to travel to the mars ', u'we want to travel to another place ', u'and now that s not enough ', u'we want to travel into the past and future ', u'all this longing is again exploratory in nature ', u'whether you go on vacation to maldives', u'or you want to go to mars ', u'it is fundamentally exploratory ', u'maybe you re also thinking of relaxation and pleasure and whatever ', u'but essentially it s exploratory ', u'otherwise why can t you do it here ', u'it s something that you want to do ', u'you want to touch another place ', u'this longing is there in the human being', u'only as long as the life that you are remains in a seed form ', u'that is  it did not sprout and blossom ', u'this happened ', u'when adiyogi was expounding the science of yoga', u'and talking about the nature of the cosmos ', u'how it s related to your individual self', u'and what you can do with it ', u'then the seven sages who were with him ', u'they asked   what is the nature of this cosmos ', u'how big is it ', u'where does it begin  where does it end ', u'so he laughed and said ', u' your entire cosmos  i can pack it into a mustard seed ', u'because your ideas of time and space are essentially because', u'you re living within the framework of your intellect ', u'if you cross that dimension ', u'then there is no such thing as time and space ', u'everything is here and now ', u'so  traveling through time  space  ', u'no  it means nothing to me because ', u'it s difficult to express ', u'difficult to articulate ', u'if i sound little', u'i have a reputation of being very logical', u'but if i sound illogical or silly to you ', u'you can blame it on my jetlag ', u'i ve just come from united states after six weeks ', u'so you can say   maybe he was jetlagged ', u'that s why sadhguru s saying something silly ', u'but i m fine ', u'i m saying this because', u"you can't fit the universe into your silly little logic ", u'today s human being is too overly enamored with their own logic ', u'that they re missing the entire life ', u'the gamut of phenomena that s happening in the existence is missed', u'because the only way you can accept anything is', u'it has to fit into the square hole of your logic ', u'anything that doesn t fit into your logic  you will reject ', u'in this  you ve rejected the entire cosmos ', u'in this  you ve rejected the magic of life ', u'you have become a slave of logic', u'and completely missing the magic of life ', u'so  this time  space  all this stuff is because', u'intellectually you re trying to dissect the universe', u'and try to understand this  this  this ', u'tell me  if you sit here ', u'suppose you re very joyful ', u'do you see ', u'you will not know how the day passed off ', u'and if you re depressed  do you see the day won t pass ', u'so time is a consequence of the miserable nature of human existence ', u'if you were truly blissed out and ecstatic ', u'you wouldn t know what is a day ', u'what is a year ', u'what is a lifetime ', u'you wouldn t know ', u'there ve been times  i sat down  i didn t realize  i thought it s five minutes', u'but people gathered around and started molesting my feet  ', u'no  because they ', u'in their understanding i sat there for many days or whatever ', u'this idea of time and space is a very convoluted idea ', u'simply because people are stuck in the framework of their logic ', u'my work ', u'my fundamental work is to take people', u'beyond the framework of logic into the true magic of existence ', u'our own existence ', u'but it takes a lot of time ', u'still my reputation is of being very logically correct', u'because i m still trying to woo them  tch  ', u'still wooing them  you know  ', u'for the real thing to happen ', u'they will take a long time unfortunately', u'because they have become such slaves of their logic ', u' what is the first thing you notice when you meet a person ', u' just everything ', u' everything ', u' everything  past  present and future   ', u' is it more important to do what you love or love what you re doing ', u' one word or more  ', u' the choice is entirely yours ', u' see  if you are an intelligent person  you will try to do what you love most ', u'but if you re a genius  you will do just what is needed  ', u' if you could be invisible for a day  what would you do  ', u' you wouldn t know  ', u' with due respect  what is your biggest weakness ', u' hmm  biggest  ', u' what is your biggest weakness ', u' see  what normally people treat as weakness in their lives ', u'okay ', u'let me give a normal answer ', u'why ', u'why am i going into all this ', u'already you said i m  what  what is the word ', u'sashayed   hmm  ', u'my biggest weakness is i love danger ', u'without danger  i cannot live ', u'i need to do something  which ', u'which keeps me on the edge of being mortal ', u'being alive and dead ', u'i want to walk that line all the time ', u'every day i m stepping on it one way or the other  ', u'is it a weakness ', u'i don t think so  but people think ', u' sadhguru  you shouldn t risk your life like this ', u'but if there s no risk  i m feel ', u'i feel i m not being ', u'because most of the time in my life ', u'for whatever i m doing ', u'i don t feel tested ', u'it s only in moments of danger that i feel little tested ', u'so my weakness is  i like to be stretched  you know ', u'for all the time when i was riding across india and later on i started driving ', u'my only wish was that ', u'to find a machine  which will test my skills ', u'always found the damn things broke down if i took it to my limits ', u'these days recently  i m beginning to get to do a few machines ', u'which are testing me  whether i can push it all the way or not  ', u'maybe that s because of my age  ', u' no ', u' if i had met them much younger ', u'i think i would have', u' you would have managed to work around them  ', u'one thing the world doesn t know about you ', u' they don t know a thing about me  ', u'that s a fact  ', u' and the one thing you wish you could change about yourself ', u' oh  i never looked at that  ', u'i could speak hindi  ', u'no  i m sorry  marathi  ', u' the one thing you wish you could change about the world ', u' tch  oh  a lot of things ', u' one ', u' human beings  ', u' desperately in need of  ', u'sir  what would you consider to be your greatest achievement ', u' i don t think there s any', u'because i always fall woefully short of my own expectation of what i could do  ', u'so  i never feel anything is an achievement  ', u' is there a song you love and can listen to all the time ', u' oh   i somehow ', u' ', u'no  ', u'probably because this came to me at a certain time', u'when i was in my early teens maybe ', u'so this one song kind of comes back to me more often than anything else ', u'it s not that i even seek it but somehow ', u'one way or the other  this song keeps coming back to me ', u'is', u' how many times    ', u' okay  okay  i know you haven t seen any of my films', u'but do you have a favorite film ', u' oh  i ve seen many good movies ', u'at one time  i saw a lot of them ', u'i ve not seen much of indian cinema', u'but i saw a lot of  you know  english cinema ', u'but one movie that i thoroughly  thoroughly enjoyed at that time', u'because on that day the way things happened ', u'many life situations fell together and everything ', u'was roman holiday ', u' oh  ', u'well  i have to say that that s the first film i ve ever seen in my life ', u'my mother took me to the cinema  ', u' here we are ', u' it is true ', u'roman holiday is the first film i ever saw ', u'it was my introduction to the big screen  ', u'i m glad i have something in common with you  ', u' that image of audrey and gregory peck is  somehow just stayed with me  ', u' wonderful ', u' it was probably my age  ', u' yeah  it must have been ', u'something you enjoy doing and wish you had more time for ', u' i wish i had more time because', u'i made myself like this ', u'that there is nothing that i enjoy or do not enjoy ', u'i make sure i enjoy everything that i do ', u'including simply sitting quietly  or talking to somebody ', u'or doing whatever  because my activity is not limited to one area ', u'so many things ', u'if you did not enjoy everything that you do and do not do ', u'you will go insane trying to manage so many things ', u'but i ll not go insane because i enjoy being alive ', u'activity is ', u'anything is okay ', u'everything i do  i enjoy  ', u'small things  big things  every kind of thing ', u'most profound things and silly things ', u'i enjoy thoroughly   ', u' as should us all ', u'lastly  in a biopic made on you  who would play you  ', u' but who would make a biopic  first of all  ', u' no ', u'there would be lots of interested people ', u' maybe you should animate  ', u' i don t think you would want that  ', u'well  that is the end of the rapid fire', u'and you totally deserve the hamper that doesn t exist on this platform  ', u'but it s a virtual hamper that i ve given to you with my  love  gratitude', u'and deepest amount of respect ', u'thank you   ', u' thank you ', u' i think before we open questions to the house ', u'it s integral for me to share that', u'the last week that i spent reading about you and hearing everything that you had to say  ', u'so many people question you  including juhi   who s in the house  ', u'it s been exhilarating  it s been enlightening and more than anything else ', u'i think it gave me a certain sense of understanding about where i am ', u'being at a crossroad of my life emotionally', u'and also now as a newfound parent ', u'i read some of what you had to say about even parenting ', u'to me  it was extremely enlightening to read that ', u'that not to nurture the dos and don ts so strongly on your child ', u'we all have theories of parenting', u'but i think just what i imbibe from what you had to say is', u'that if i am strong willed', u'and i exude a certain amount of pleasantness', u'and i give out the right amount of energies ', u'my child and my children will emulate that  imbibe that', u'and i don t have to constantly force feed that knowledge on them ', u'they will imbibe it from my energy source in any case ', u'that is what i drew with  am i right ', u' no  ', u' okay ', u' see  one level right ', u'but it s not question of energy and', u'don t  don t make simple aspects of life mystical', u'because my entire life is dedicated to make mystical very approachable ', u'but generally in the society ', u'people are trying to make simple aspects of life mystical ', u'rearing a child is not a mystical dimension of life ', u'it s', u'millions of people have done it ', u'for thousands of generations  people have done it ', u'we are not reinventing anything here ', u'it s just a simple biological process ', u'every creature does it ', u'a bird is teaching its offspring to  you know  find a worm', u'and a worm is teaching its offspring to escape the bird ', u'all kinds of things are happening in their own way ', u'similarly human beings are doing it ', u'but as we get more educated ', u'we become more fussy about it ', u'there was a time that a whole lot of parents had eight ten children ', u'they did not even know their names ', u'number one  number two  they called them  ', u'but they grew up somehow  ', u'they just provided the basic ecosystem and they just grew up ', u'so let s not make it too whatever because', u'you can easily', u'because today is a time of just one child or two children', u'and we ve become totally ', u'overly emotional about what is ours', u'and we lose perspective of what is the reality ', u'a child will grow up anyway ', u'if they re nourished  they will grow up ', u'now what should they grow up as ', u'should they grow up confused ', u'should they grow up strong ', u'should they grow up stable ', u'should they become sage like ', u'should they become something else ', u'that s a question ', u'what they should become in the world is a social issue ', u'that will be decided in the times in which they grow up and the exposure that they have ', u'now you become a filmmaker', u'not because you re intrinsically a filmmaker ', u'because you are in mumbai ', u'you come from that kind of family and the atmosphere around you is like that ', u'naturally you choose that ', u'suppose you were somewhere else ', u'let s say 1000 years ago you were somewhere else ', u'would you be thinking of filmmaking ', u'no  you would be thinking of something else ', u'so what we do in our lives is just a circumstantial thing ', u'let s not read too much into it ', u'the question is ', u'when we have children  how complete and joyful and wonderful are they ', u'because every life is aspiring not to do this or that ', u'every life is aspiring only to become a full fledged life ', u'that s all ', u'whether it s a worm  insect  or plant  or tree ', u'they re only aspiring to become a full fledged life ', u'there is no other aspiration in life  including ourselves ', u'only problem with the human being is ', u'we know what is a full fledged worm ', u'we know what is a full fledged mango tree ', u'but we don t know what is a full fledged human being ', u'this is the only problem ', u'my work is just this ', u'to make people perceive ', u'not understand  ', u'you must understand the difference or the distinction', u'between perceiving  experiencing and understanding  ', u'not understand  but perceive and experience what it means to be a full fledged life human being ', u'and that s all that must happen to your children and every other children', u'every other child on the planet ', u'what should happen ', u'they must become full fledged life  that s all ', u'for this ', u'they need an ecosystem and nourishment ', u'not teaching from another time ', u'because you belong to an another time  you are past ', u'you may not like it ', u'i am not saying as a director  you are past ', u'i am saying   in terms of time  compared to your children  you are past  okay ', u'so one important thing that we need to do when we have children is ', u'no', u'to help them not to get overly identified with us ', u'this is to make an investment  ', u'heavy investment', u'child means  ', u'but not expect any return ', u'tch  tch  tch ', u'this is difficult for a stock market world ', u'how to make an investment without return ', u'but this is what bringing up a child means ', u'you want to make a heavy investment  no return expected ', u'this is all ', u'if you want to', u'because i have ', u'you know  in raising my girl   i won t go into the lengthy affair  ', u'but i made sure nobody teaches her anything', u'nor did i teach her anything ', u'no one two three ', u'no a b c ', u'no  mary had a little lamb ', u'because i don t care whether mary had a lamb or not   you know ', u'people said   sadhguru  the way you are bringing up this girl ', u'she won t know how many fingers she has ', u'i said   i don t care whether she knows how many fingers she has', u'as long as she knows how to use her fingers    ', u'why should she know this is ten ', u'she thinks this is hundred ', u'actually this used to happen ', u'when she was just', u'because i just exposed her to nature ', u'as much as possible  i expose', u'if there is nothing else  at least i took her up on the terrace', u'and showed her the stars  which you can t do in mumbai ', u'you will show other kinds of stars in mumbai  ', u'so  she would look up at the sky and say  ', u'she would call be by name  first name and say  ', u' jaggi  ten ', u'ten stars  tch ', u'because in her mind  the biggest number is ten ', u'somewhere she heard ten  ', u'so she didn t say million ', u'she said ten ', u'i said   yes  ten ', u'what is the problem  whether ten stars or ten billion stars ', u'what is your problem ', u'you think you are very knowledgeable because you know there are hundred billion galaxies ', u'in what way does it matter', u'whether there are hundred billion or there are none ', u'what way does it matter ', u'because you are not seeing stars ', u'you are only seeing the reflection in your mind  isn t it ', u'if you spend time to know the nature of what makes you experience all this', u'so  she asked me once something ', u'so i just told her just this ', u' this is all you need to know about life ', u'never look up to anybody ', u'she looked at me like this ', u'i said   not even me ', u'because the value of me will be completely lost the day you look up to me ', u'you must look at me just as i am ', u'then you will see immense value for who i am ', u'if you look up to me  you will miss everything', u'and one day you want to hang me on your wall ', u'as you did to everybody else  to rama  krishna  buddha  shiva  everybody ', u'you hung them on your wall ', u'you will hang me also on your wall ', u'you will miss the entire value ', u'you missed all those guys  now you ll miss me also ', u'you must look at me just the way i am ', u'never look up to anybody ', u'never look down on anybody  this is all  ', u'once you do not look up to anything or look down on anything ', u'you will see everything just the way it is ', u'if you see everything just the way it is ', u'you will navigate your life', u'through life effortlessly ', u' that s true ', u'that is simple theory and easy enough to live by  ', u'thank you  thank you sadhguru ', u'with that  i think i would like to open the questions up to the house', u'and i am sure we have a volley of questions  which i can already see ', u'hands going up in the air ', u'i don t even know where to start  okay  yeah ', u' i ve worked hard for this  please ', u' sorry ', u' i ve worked hard for this  please ', u' you ve worked hard for this  okay  then i suppose hard work should never go unfounded ', u' hello ', u' is there a mike that is circulating  ', u' okay  you can shout it ', u' yeah  if you have worked hard ', u'you can scream loud  ', u'yeah  there you go ', u' namaste sadhguru and hi karan johar ', u'i am thirty one ', u'i have kept myself single all my life  so that i could accomplish', u' no  no  you should go back there  it s  it doesn t come to me  the sound ', u' yeah ', u'my name is rishabh  i am thirty one ', u'i ve kept myself single all my life  so i could accomplish  something big ', u'and you of all people should know how important and difficult it is ', u'important because to accomplish something big ', u'if you re single ', u'it helps without added responsibilities on your shoulders ', u'and difficult because', u' i know you are trying to speak from your heart', u'but microphone works best here   ', u' i just didn t want to be too loud  okay ', u'and difficult because  india ', u'they keep asking you why you are still single ', u'i would like to space dive', u'and i have talked to a million people about this', u'and i have knocked on a hundred doors ', u'to turned down every single time', u'including the doors of isro  ', u' i can t hear a thing ', u' including the doors of isro', u'and they said they don t have enough funds ', u' it s a very long question and we have not heard most of it ', u' i can t hear a thing actually ', u'i am feeling incap', u' yeah ', u' what is your question  sir ', u' okay  so my question is i would like to space dive', u' you would like to space ', u' space dive ', u'so it s basically going all the way up to space', u' you want to go to space ', u' okay ', u' and diving from there ', u' okay ', u' and tie what in space ', u' dive ', u' it s space dive ', u' oh  space dive ', u' yes ', u' oh  you want to space dive ', u' yes ', u' okay ', u' so the thing is i have knocked on a hundred doors', u'only to be turned down every single time', u'because even isro turned me down saying they don t have enough funds ', u'space dive is important because', u'india has gone leaps and bounds forward in space technology ', u'but in the human space psychology it s way back ', u'my question to you sadhguru is', u'my biggest weakness is i like to live in danger ', u'my question to you sadhguru is ', u'where do i find an organization that will help me with the discipline ', u'yoga and meditation that ll help me with this ', u' isha foundation ', u' and where do i find a person ', u'most preferably a music  movie director ', u'they ll fund this project ', u'understand the importance of it ', u' hey  you', u'  understand the importance of this project ', u'that india needs a human space program ', u'fund it and make a movie out of it ', u'which has less drama ', u'less songs and more of how a person struggles to get the mission accomplished ', u'thank you very much ', u' okay  we got the question ', u'you took a long time to get to the question but', u' he wants to space dive ', u'he wants me to make a movie  he want to    ', u' no  no  no  he wants money  ', u' he wants money ', u'my dearest thirty one year old   that s all i heard ', u'that you were thirty one  ', u'if i had money  the last thing i would do is give it to you to space dive  ', u'there s many things that i would do with that money', u'and yours is not on my bucket list ', u'but would you like to answer his space diving ', u' the day after tomorrow ', u'that s on fifth   day after tomorrow is', u' is the sixth ', u' i m sorry  tomorrow  tomorrow evening', u'tomorrow evening i am at the isro at sriharikota for the launch  ', u'let me see if i can attach you to the rocket  ', u' thank you ', u'yes ', u'will you pass your mike on  sir ', u' no  no', u' no ', u'  the boy is very serious ', u' yeah he is very serious about this  ', u"i don't know  would you", u' so about you being single  ', u'you are sa', u'you have saved one life  ', u'and i want to tell you ', u'whether you space dive  or you don t dive  or you nosedive  ', u'all of us are born single and we die single ', u'tch  in between  what drama is  you do is up to you ', u'so you want to do a single act  or a double act  or a multiple act  it s up to you  ', u'but essentially  we are born single and we die single ', u'and if you want to space dive', u'this is comic book stuff ', u'it means nothing ', u'do not waste your life ', u'you are a young man ', u'don t waste your life thinking ', u' i want to space dive ', u'i want to do this and karan is going to fund it ', u'he made is very clear ', u'he has other ideas for his money and i am glad  ', u' well  you get married  that s like space diving  ', u'it s the same thing ', u'you don t know where you are going  you are just diving  ', u'yes  ', u'that s true ', u' namaskaram ', u' namaskaram ', u' when i told my teenage daughter about this program ', u'her immediate reaction was an excited wow ', u'she is here with me and this program is everything we thought it would be ', u'question for you  karan  ', u'what exactly inspired you to do this session with sadhguru ', u' whoa ', u' thank you ma am ', u' he did not say he is inspired  ', u' i was ', u'and the lady definitely has it right ', u'it is because as i said somewhere that', u'there are many questions that i constantly seek answers for ', u'i find myself in a dilemma between my emotions ', u'between my fears ', u'my anxieties ', u'my tussle internally between my letting go of religion', u'and holding on to what i understand of spirituality ', u'i haven t been able to seek too many answers through the books i have read', u'or the people i have heard ', u'to me  sadhguru has been a revelation in more ways than one', u'because he made many of my answers', u'the answers that i was looking for resonate with my life ', u'and i think eventually  what we look for is deep resonance ', u'and anything that you attach yourself to  be  a spiritual energy ', u'a god perhaps ', u'a religion ', u'you feel that you need to find answers within that resonance ', u'and i felt that my life resonated with everything that you said', u'and everything that you professed', u'and that s why i was very interested and excited to be part of this platform  ', u'yes sir  i m sorry ', u'i was meant to go to you first ', u'behind you  he s  sir ', u'i ll come back to you sir ', u'the mike', u' thank you ', u'namaskaram sadhguru ', u'hello karan ', u' hi ', u' there are two questions ', u'if the first one is answered  i don t need the second one s answer ', u'this is a request  ', u'can i please get a hug from you  sadhguru  ', u' hey  why don t you try him   ', u' why am i a second in that line  ', u' i didn t name the person ', u' what is your second question ', u'the first is you want a hug  second is what ', u'you can t', u'don t go into a kiss then because  that might be detrimental ', u' no ', u'just the presence of sadhguru for the first time in my life ', u'i just don t want to miss it ', u"i don't know when will i will get the chance next ", u'so if i could just ', u'i know it s a difficult one ', u' no  no  nothing difficult about it ', u'it is just that i have been working with people to make them understand', u'people  especially outside the country', u'and now unfortunately it s caught up here ', u' where is my hug  sadhguru ', u'can i get my hug ', u'tch  you are turning something beautiful into something very ugly ', u'when you are in a certain state of inclusiveness ', u'if it became necessary  you embrace somebody ', u'it s a very beautiful act ', u'now it s a commodity   where is my hug ', u'it s something  that you give and take ', u'it s not a transaction ', u'this is what religion has done  ', u'everybody hugs three times  or four times  or whatever number of times ', u'this is not what it is ', u'all the  the tenderness that a human being feels within himself or herself ', u'you re destroying it and make it into some kind of act ', u'okay  i will hug you ', u'i ll hug every one of you ', u'what about it ', u'sweat exchange  ', u'so  this is something we need to do ', u'and people also', u'in india  this happens ', u'they grab my hand and ', u' sadhguru bless me  and they place it on their own head  ', u'my', u'blessing will not come like this ', u'blessing will come when you become receptive ', u'when you are in a certain way ', u'if it s blessed  something wonderful can happen out of it ', u'something tremendous can happen out of it ', u'you grab my hand and   ', u'what is that blessing ', u'and if you grab my hand or foot or you hug me forcefully ', u'this is called molestation  ', u' all right ', u'you got your jadu ki jhappi  ', u'we had  yes sir  yeah ', u' hello  namaskar sadhguru ', u'i know a hug is not possible but you cook very good dosa ', u'is that possible  ', u' certainly not here  ', u' i know ', u'no  my question is that when we cook ', u'if we have to get joy   \njoy of cooking ', u'then that joy is something which is internal and i cook for my joy ', u'but when you are cooking for others  then you want to give them joy', u'and at times there is a conflict ', u'who should win ', u' this is for him  ', u' no sir ', u' no  no  it s for you only  ', u'i have different things on my menu  ', u' see  let us not make everything', u'this is the most fundamental thing about being spiritual', u'or spiritual process means just this ', u'you  essentially  spiritual process means just this ', u'that you live here like only you exist ', u'nobody else but you ', u'because you see everybody as yourself', u'and there is no issue ', u'people ask me ', u' sadhguru  wherever you go ', u'whether it s 10000 people or 100000 people  how do you speak ', u' ah  well i am talking to them like i ve  if at i', u'if i had the habit   i don t have  ', u'if i had the habit of talking in front of my mirror ', u'how i would speak to myself ', u'that s how i am speaking ', u'there is no', u'you  you  what i am doing is not some kind of oratory or discourse ', u'i am just talking like i would talk to myself', u'because i don t see anybody but myself ', u'so  spiritual process means just this ', u'that in some way you became all inclusive  in your experience you became all inclusive ', u'so  one thing that has disappeared from your life is comparison and competition ', u'comparison starts and then it transforms itself into competition', u'and then it goes into ugly things ', u'so even for something as alive and as beautiful as joy', u'joy is ', u'joy is the most important aspect of your life  you know ', u'that is  joy means your experience of you being ', u'your existence is fantastic ', u'your experience of your existence has become beautiful ', u'that s why you re joyful ', u'now  i am not joyful because i make  ', u'i make the best dosas  not you  okay   ', u'not because i make the best dosas ', u'nor will i be super joyful because i eat whatever the best things that you cook ', u'before i come into your restaurant  i ll be very joyful ', u'if you make something good  i will eat joyfully ', u'if you make something bad very joyfully i will push it aside ', u'but with your good cooking or bad cooking  you can t steal my joy ', u'nor can you give my joy ', u'i want you also and everybody in the world become like this ', u'that somebody else cannot determine', u'what happens within you  ', u'because', u' yes ma am ', u'  you are', u'you are calling fundamental sense of slavery that you get into', u'with beautiful names ', u'this is dangerous ', u'so anyway  people are saying wonderful things about your cooking ', u'they have not said anything about you ', u'but they have said wonderful things about your cooking ', u'i would like to eat one day  ', u'i don t know if i can afford it but ', u' yes ma am ', u'we ll get a mike for you ma am ', u' namaste sadhguruji  my name is devika patel', u'and i d like to ask you a question because you re a mystic', u'and even otherwise ', u'please don t say   i don t care ', u'because many people out here i m sure do ', u'my question is  what do you think of reincarnation ', u'do you believe in it and if so ', u'can you elaborate on the subject', u'and let us know what you were in your last birth ', u'thank you ', u' now you ve already put strictures on me ', u'as to what i should not say ', u'for me ', u'last three lifetimes have been same work ', u'around the same place', u'and a few people  handful of people  same people ', u'to such an extent', u'that sometimes by mistake i end up calling them by old names ', u'but you should not believe all this nonsense  ', u'no ', u'because the moment you believe it ', u'you will look at this person and little if they are friendly with you ', u' oh  maybe in my last life  ', u'my past life ', u'it is very good you don t remember a thing about anything', u'because in your present life ', u'you are not able to handle the emotional tangles', u'and psychological involvements with people ', u'if you remember ten lifetimes ', u'you would break your mind ', u'it takes an extraordinary sense of dispassion', u'to download many lifetimes of memory', u'and still not respond or react to those things', u'and simply see it for what it is ', u'in your present state  if such things happen ', u'it ll be a disaster ', u'but anyway you should not believe these things', u'because you should not believe anything or anybody ', u'you should not disbelieve them either ', u'now  in such a large crowd', u'i have a huge reputation of being very logically correct', u'and now you re making me say such stupid things ', u'i m staking my reputation ', u'you must understand that i wouldn t make that mistake ', u'because i don t gain anything by talking about this ', u'because you insisted that i should not dismiss it', u'but essentially  what you re asking is  ', u'let me translate this question for you ', u'essentially what you re asking is  ', u'when you say ', u' is there a past life or is there a future life ', u'what you re asking is ', u' beyond this body  is there something more ', u'this is all you re asking ', u' after my death or before my birth  was there something else ', u'this is the question  or you are asking ', u' what is the nature of my existence ', u'well  that s my full time business ', u'to bring you to that experience as to what is the nature of your existence ', u'you must come ', u'you should not ask just a casual question here in mumbai and disappear ', u'now you made me say illogical things in front of all these people ', u'now you must invest some time to know what is the nature of your existence ', u'otherwise it s entertainment question  ', u' i don t know  you have a color you like  ', u'i don t know who to ask ', u' he is working hard but after him  i am afraid of hard working  ', u' yes  yes  yes ', u'hard working in blue  ', u' can i have mike or can i speak like this ', u' no  no  no we ll get you a mike ', u'we have just two questions after this gentlemen ', u' yeah  yeah  i am going to get there  right there ', u' namaskaram sadhguru  namaskaram karan sir ', u' please somebody give a mike to that lady', u'who is up there with her hand up  after this boy is over  yeah ', u' yeah  yeah ', u' pranam sadhguru ', u'my name is aishwarya nigam', u'and i have been to the ashram many times', u'and i have read many of your books ', u' you must quickly come to the question  everybody is waiting ', u' the question is  sadhguru ', u'i m stuck here i want you please guide me ', u'tell me in a child s language what is the answer and what is the solution ', u'i don t want to give importance to my own thoughts and emotions ', u'tell me how ', u'please make me understand  ', u'i don t know when will i get this mike again', u'although i m always in your presence ', u'but i want the answer sadhguru ', u'i don t want to    ', u' when you get out of this hall  start walking south  ', u'if it s a genuine question ', u'if it s a question which truly matters  you must seek ', u'i would have gone to the ends of the world ', u'if i found somebody  who could answer the billion questions i had ', u'if really it matters to you  the question  you must seek ', u'if you think going south is the answer ', u'if you don t think so  you shouldn t bother with me ', u'if you think so  you shouldn t waste a moment of your life', u'because i want everybody to at least be straight and in', u'some basic integrity to your life ', u'you ask big questions', u'and you leave it and go sit in the matinee show ', u'tch ', u'i m not saying you should not go to the matinee ', u'i m sorry  ', u'i m saying the wrong things ', u'wrong examples  ', u' that s fine ', u'no offense taken  ', u' so  i want you to understand', u'people  somebody came and ask me recently ', u' sadhguru  are you a devotee of shiva ', u'i said  you fool ', u'did you ever see me sitting somewhere and doing shiva pooja ', u'did you see me ', u'my entire bloody life ', u'i have invested in you  all right ', u'there is nothing else i do ', u'except constantly seeing how to raise people to the next step ', u'and you are asking me  am i devoted to somebody ', u'i m bloody devoted to you and you are not seeing it    ', u'so  when you ask this question ', u'i take the question seriously  i believe you re genuine ', u'but then you go and get drunk today evening ', u'i am not against any of those things ', u'matinee or drink or this or that ', u'all i am saying is you must have some integrity to your life ', u'when you ask a big question ', u'you must make the investment  isn t it  of time and energy ', u'you must invest life because to bloody answer this ', u'i ve invested my entire life  ', u'yes  ', u' sadhguru  you had pointed out  there was', u'yes  to the lady right at the back ', u' that lady  please  ', u' i have a question ', u' one moment sir ', u'we re just going to the lady and then we ll get', u'where  who is that person ', u' here  right ', u' she still doesn t have the microphone ', u'he is on  on it ', u' okay  you re on the mike  all right go ahead ', u' namaskaram sadhguruji  my question is ', u'what can be the greatest change one can bring to our life', u'to make it more blissful in this birth ', u' you got to change ', u' you have to ', u' you got to change  i said  ', u' you got to change ', u' there s nothing else  ', u'you think by doing something else  this  will become blissful ', u'no ', u'this one  has to change to become blissful ', u' yes  the lady  has she got the mike ', u'yes  just reaching you ma am ', u' namaskar to one and all ', u'sir  my question is ', u'i get very attached easily', u'and now i feel i m very attached to my responsibilities ', u'so how do i break this bondage', u'and if i really want to do something for myself ', u'not for anybody ', u'just to feel the joy that i ve been listening to you ', u'if i want to really  really feel that joy ', u'how do you i break the bondage of responsibilities', u'and move ahead', u'and how do i overcome my attachments ', u' oh   i want you to understand that', u'responsibility is never a bondage ', u'responsibility means you chose to respond to something wholeheartedly ', u'so it is never a bondage ', u'and how is it opposing your joy  i don t understand ', u'because to what extent you have the ability to respond ', u'only to that extent you know life ', u'if you lose your ability to respond ', u'you become dead ', u'in fact  somebody is dead means they ve lost all ability to respond  that s all it is ', u'so  don t ever think your responsibility is stopping you from being joyful ', u'if you had no responsibilities  ', u'many of you would be freaked to madness ', u'you are fortunate you got something to dabble with ', u'nothing to do  i ll keep you in a room ', u'nothing to do  i ll feed you well ', u'you ll go crazy ', u'you must be glad there are distractions for your madness ', u'so  you must understand this ', u'if  if your experience of life is such that', u'if you sit here  you start enjoying your existence  ', u'not your thought ', u'not your emotion ', u'not your action ', u'your existence if you start enjoying  ', u'you have a certain joy and blissfulness about your very existence ', u'then all this jargon doesn t work ', u'if that one thing has not happened to you ', u'you are in a desperate condition ', u'you have to do a million things to know a little bit of pleasantness ', u'but tell me sincerely ', u'genuinely ', u'in a twenty four hour segment ', u'how many moments of actual joy do you know ', u'most people can count on their fingers ', u'many people have nothing to count ', u'they will say', u' oh  the day i got married  i was so happy ', u'the day i got my job  i was so happy ', u'it happened  it s history ', u'because it is externally instigated ', u'otherwise by yourself you will become a wreck ', u'please change this ', u'then all these jargons and philosophies are irrelevant to you', u'because you know the joy of your existence ', u' thank you  ', u'we have one last question  yes sir ', u' hmm  haa  haa ', u'i m just going from this gentleman ', u'i ll come to you ', u'maybe two', u'yes', u' sadhguru', u' i ll leave that to sadhguru ', u'after this how many more he d like to answer   but yes ', u' sadhguruji namaskaram  karanji namaskaram ', u' namaskaram ', u' i m mohit saldana ', u'i ve come from karnal just to see you live and i m feeling blissfully blessed ', u'i didn t come with the question but now i have a question ', u'sadhguruji  you just made a mention that world does not know anything about you ', u'and that remains a fact ', u'even then  any so body world who comes in little contact with you gets so much benefitted ', u'so when would you reveal ', u'or my question is  what does it take to become a arjuna for the yogi of highest order of our times ', u'our krishna  the you to reveal  ', u'sorry if that question is still invalid ', u' this is', u'this is difficult to articulate without sounding all wrong because', u'see  everybody is working', u'or everybody is trying to live their life', u'with different frames that they have created for themselves ', u'you can call this mindsets ', u'you can call this framework ', u'you can call this family ', u'you can call this society  you can call this ethics  morals  ideologies  whatever ', u'these are all frameworks you created ', u'but you understand ', u'a frame means you are putting a self imposed limitation upon yourself ', u'i can understand ', u'he being a director producer ', u'he s thinking of frames ', u'because he s thinking of capturing something for doing something else ', u'i m asking you a simple question ', u'do you want to capture this life ', u'or do you want to experience this life ', u'hello ', u' experience ', u' you want to experience this life  ', u'you re here to experience this life  and no other reason ', u'everything else is secondary ', u'when i say life ', u'when i use the word life ', u'most of you will think', u' oh  my work  family ', u'my home  my car  my dog  that s not life ', u'these are all accessories to life ', u'you added all these accessories  believing that', u'with these accessories  your life will get enhanced ', u'but your money  your wealth  your family  your relationships ', u'these are all just accessories  isn t it ', u'the real thing is here  ', u'never experienced ', u'so  to first make somebody', u'i m  you know  there re many wonderful people around me ', u'this is the biggest wealth i have ', u'i have some truly  absolutely fabulous people around me all the time ', u'they won t let me pass through a single day', u'without tears of joy  love  ecstasy ', u'without witnessing this  a single day won t pass for me ', u'no matter which part of the world i am in ', u'i don t think there s better wealth in the world ', u'in the physical world  in the human societies  than that ', u'that constantly you re surrounded by people ', u'who are shedding tears of love and ecstasy ', u'having said that ', u'their experience might have become beautiful by being in a certain presence ', u'by realizing a few things ', u'but still  they still have frameworks', u'because very few individuals have the sense of', u'a total sense of abandon to be here without framework ', u'as long as you re with the framework ', u'we can add one drop here ', u'one drop there ', u'one more drop means it ll break ', u'so in my life ', u'if ', u'by the time i fall dead ', u'if i can share', u'maybe one or two percentages of what i have known ', u'i think i m very fortunate ', u'because i m still looking ', u'i ve not given up on it ', u'there can always be one or two individuals who ll come up ', u'we have been working on them ', u'preparing them ', u'so that somebody can exist here without any sense of frames ', u'without any sense of what will be lost ', u'there are many people around me ', u'who  you know ', u'in every action that they do  ', u'they re not saying it verbally  ', u'in every action that they do ', u'they show that they re willing to die for me ', u'i keep reminding them in a thousand ways ', u'dying for me is not the answer ', u'that you are willing to allow this life  to happen in full flow ', u'this is where the answer is ', u'because only if you re a full fledged life ', u'can i share what s happening within me ', u'otherwise  i m talking about extending your frames ', u'giving you a different frame which is more difficult to manipulate  ', u'but totally undoing the frames will need this ', u'that you are a full fledged life ', u'when i say a full fledged life ', u'right now you

wrinkly  ', u'i ve so enjoyed the spirit of joyful curiosity ', u'so in the spirit of hospitality ', u'in the spirit of joyful curiosity', u'and coming together across traditions ', u'i would love to hear your thoughts on a number of topics ', u'the one that is near and dear to my heart ', u'as an educator', u'and as a physician and a pastor ', u'is this area of wellness and burnout ', u'physicians today', u'a big study came out  ', u'fifty four percent of physicians in america meet criteria for burnout ', u'and nurses are in the same boat ', u'and you re here at a medical school', u'and we re looking for answers', u'and we re looking for hope ', u'and so  to those fifty four percent of physicians who are burned out ', u'and the nurses and pas and nurse practitioners ', u'all of us in healthcare ', u'what would you say to them ', u' if we have to bring health ', u'either to ourselves or to others ', u'one fundamental thing is ', u'you bring a very profound sense of wholeness into you  ', u'the various dimensions of life that we are ', u'all of it is in sync and functioning well ', u'it s sad to hear that', u'physicians are in a state of burnout ', u'how would they cause health ', u'they could sell more medicine ', u'but they cannot cause health if they are in a state of burnout ', u'now we re seeing  as modern medicine progresses ', u'comes out with miracle after miracle ', u'research  all kinds of things ', u'but people are not getting healthy ', u'more people are getting sick than ever before ', u'a country like united states ', u'which is the most affluent country on the planet ', u'which essentially means you have a choice of nourishments ', u'every human being has a choice of nourishment ', u'most of the ailment that you see in other parts of the world', u'are nourishment related in some way', u'because the needed nourishment is not there at the right time', u'for a whole lot of people on this planet ', u'but in a country where there is a choice of nourishment  ', u'i would say an excessive choice of nourishment  ', u'a nation is spending three trillion dollars on healthcare ', u'this is bigger than the budgets of major nations in the world ', u'india s economy is around three trillion dollars ', u'you re spending that much on healthcare of a quarter million people ', u'this shows somewhere we have missed health ', u'maybe we have an industry going but we have missed health ', u'well  we can explain it in so many ways', u'but doctors being under burnout', u'everybody thinks their profession is the most difficult one ', u'if  if any individual human being is creating something that they really care for ', u'there would be never any kind of burnout ', u'myself and a whole lot of people around me ', u'we are seven days of the week ', u'twenty hours a day  three hundred and sixty five days ', u'this s our schedule ', u'you will not see me burned out ', u'maybe sometimes i ll get physically exhausted ', u'maybe i ll die of exhaustion one day ', u'but definitely not of burnout or boredom ', u'those two things will never happen to me ', u'why i m saying this is ', u'the fundamental reason why this is happening is  ', u'particularly the physicians because', u'there re various kinds of professions ', u'but particularly when people go to a doctor ', u'in some way they re placing their life in his hands ', u'so when somebody is willing to place their life in your hands ', u'you must treat it as a sacred duty ', u'it s not just a job ', u'it s not just a business ', u'it is a ', u'when somebody is willing to place their life in your hands', u'i m telling you  even people who live with you ', u'your own wife and children or husband  is not willing to place their life in your hands completely', u' ', u'but somebody  an unknown person comes and places his life in your hands ', u'i think it s a greatest privilege that somebody trusts you at that level ', u'that they re willing to trust you with life ', u'you could do right things or wrong things ', u'knowingly or unknowingly ', u'because nobody has figured the human body absolutely  all right ', u'we know it to some extent ', u'so you may do any number of wrong things ', u'but they placed their life into your hands ', u'i think', u'traditionally  it was said like this in india ', u' in any given society ', u'if education ', u'medicine', u'and spiritual process ', u'if it gets commercialized ', u'that society will go down the drain ', u'i think we re doing this to the entire modern world ', u'all three are becoming commercialized ', u'there s nothing wrong with commerce ', u'commerce is a ', u'a transaction of give and take ', u'you give me this  i ll give you that ', u'but there are some things  which cannot be handled as just give and take ', u'if you bring this aspect of transaction into spiritual process ', u'into education', u'and into medicine ', u'then it turns ugly ', u'and that ugliness will definitely burn you out one way or the other ', u'above all  what people are experiencing as burnout is  ', u'first of all  they re doing something that they don t care for ', u'if they were genuinely doing something that they truly care for ', u'there would be no burnout ', u'the more opportunity you get to do it ', u'the better it would be  isn t it ', u'everything is towards a certain end ', u'the joy of doing what you re doing is not there in one s life ', u'this is not just for any one profession  it s for all professions ', u'but particularly in a profession like this ', u'where it s a question of life and death for somebody else ', u'when it s a question of life and death for the person who is sitting in front of you ', u"it can't be a transaction for you ", u'well  there is a business end to everything', u'because to make anything sustainable ', u'there has to be a business end to it ', u'we are not against the business end of it ', u'but within yourself ', u'if you don t do it as a great offering to the person who is sitting in front of you  ', u'of course  they will pay their fee ', u'but within yourself  if you are not like this  ', u'definitely you will burnout doing this kind of work ', u'otherwise  every day if you helped a person ', u'if in some way you made somebody s life ', u'their life better ', u'by the end of the day  should you be ballooned into a joyful state ', u'or should be in a state of burnout at the end of the day ', u'it should not be a burnout', u'if you genuinely experienced you have enhanced many lives around you ', u'this is not about service ', u'this is not about ideas of  i served this  i did this   ', u'no ', u'there is a joy within a human being', u'when they re able to touch another life ', u'why you are holding a few people dear to you as family is', u'because you believe you can touch their life in some way ', u'you can make a difference ', u'that is what is most important for a human being ', u'in every activity that we perform ', u'whatever the nature of the activity ', u'how profoundly we can touch someone else ', u'this is what makes the big difference ', u'if you make a movie ', u'you don t want to make a movie which nobody wants to watch  would you ', u'you want people to watch this movie and come to tears  isn t it ', u'you don t want to build a house that nobody wants to live in ', u'you don t want to cook something that nobody wants to eat ', u'these things you can do only because', u'in some way you are able to touch another life through your activity ', u'this is most fundamental need within the human being ', u'and as a physician ', u'you have a phenomenal opportunity of touching lives like very other ', u'very few other professions can do ', u'and this should not lead to burnout', u'but this is happening so because', u'we re trying to treat it like a transaction ', u'and the most fundamental thing that we have not understood in this process is', u'that human experience is caused from within ', u'not from outside ', u'your joy and misery ', u'your pain and pleasure ', u'your agony and ecstasy ', u'even light and darkness right now is happening only within you ', u'it never happens around you ', u'what happens within you ', u'if you try to fix it by fixing what is around you ', u'you will go bonkers in no time ', u'i am surprised why only fifty four percent  ', u'because if you don t understand human experience is caused from within', u'especially medical professionals ', u'who in some way have delved into the nature of human physiology', u'and i believe to some extent the mind ', u'we must know that every aspect of human experience comes from within ', u'and today ', u'modern medicine especially ', u'unlike the traditional medicine ', u'is entirely chemical fixes for everything ', u'so you understand that both health and illness is happening because of chemistry ', u'joy and misery is a certain chemistry ', u'different types of chemistry ', u'ecstasy and agony are different types of chemistry ', u'or in other words  we are a chemical soup ', u'the question is only ', u'are you a great soup or a lousy soup  ', u'now if i give soup making ingredients to all of you ', u'do you believe all of you will come with the same kind of soup ', u'hmm ', u'you will come with hundred different varieties of soups ', u'so there is something called as the skill of soup making ', u'all of us have come with the same fundamental ingredients of life ', u'see in how many ways we have become ', u'and only fifty four percent are getting burnt out ', u'handling life so wrong ', u'hundred percent should be burnt out ', u' so let s talk about making soup  ', u' so ', u' no  don t go into this area  i m a very good cook  ', u' okay  we ll talk', u'so  this soup of life  if you will', u'so  you know  tonight ', u'there is a nurse or a physician  who has come home', u'and they told a family member that their loved one just died ', u'or they treated a child who s undergoing chemotherapy ', u'or they were in a clinic', u'where they re taking care of someone who doesn t have enough insurance to cover that medication ', u'and so those good folks have come home', u'and their spirits are broken ', u'and they love what they do ', u'i think burned out physicians love what they do  ', u'they do ', u'and i like that metaphor of soup making ', u'what can we do ', u'and so what can we do  ', u'what can that nurse  that physician assistant  that doc ', u'what ', u'saturday morning comes around  they wake up  what should they do ', u' i  i can teach you a way of making your chemistry into a blissful chemistry ', u'that means you re blissful by your own nature ', u'not because of something that happened around you ', u'this is exactly what i m saying ', u'what this question implies is ', u'what happens around you determines what happens within you ', u'the significance of being human is this ', u'that ', u' what happens within me  i can create around me ', u'if what happens around me makes me ', u'i am still in animal nature ', u'a human being means ', u' i do all the same things that the animal does', u'but i can do all of it consciously ', u'that is the big part of being human ', u'well  you are born like any other creature ', u'you grow up  you eat  you sleep  maybe you reproduce and you die one day ', u'this is what every creature does ', u'this is what you and me do ', u'but we can do it consciously ', u'which includes your thought  your emotion  everything ', u'to put this very simply ', u'it amazes me that people are twenty  thirty  fifty  sixty years of age ', u'they still do not know how to handle their thought', u'and how to handle their emotion ', u'this is a huge disability in the world  ', u'if you don t know how to use your hands ', u'would you call that a disability ', u'if you don t know how to manage your thought ', u'how to manage your emotion ', u'is it not a disability ', u'just because everybody is in the same condition ', u'it does not become normal  ', u'so  essentially ', u'you are ', u'you have made a choice of dealing with people ', u'who are sick or dying ', u'it is a choice ', u'and it is a privilege that those who are unwell  ', u'being unwell means', u'you are no more hundred percent on your feet ', u'you need somebody s help  ', u'such people', u'and those who are dying in some way ', u'they re willing to trust you and put their life into your hands ', u'it s a great privilege ', u'well  in this ', u'there are many things to do ', u'as you gave examples ', u'that you have to convey something unpleasant to somebody ', u'sometimes you are not able to treat them', u'because either you have no time ', u'or they have no money or whatever ', u'these are there ', u'i m not questioning this ', u'but the most important aspect of this is ', u'if you want to bring well being to somebody ', u'you must know how to be well  isn t it ', u'otherwise  how would you do it  i m asking ', u'how ', u'how would you create well being to someone', u'when you do not know how to be well ', u'what this implies is ', u' if i have to be well  the world has to be perfect ', u'well  you re not going to be well  ', u'because even if you re just two people in the family ', u'not everything happens the way you think it should happen  isn t it ', u'hello ', u'you can tell me  it s okay  ', u'even if you re just two people ', u'not everything will ever happen to you hundred percent the way you want it ', u'fifty one percent if it s happening your way ', u'you have the controlling stake  ', u'anything more if you expect  you ll have a divorce  ', u'yes ', u'so  outside will never happen hundred percent the way you want it ', u'or in other words ', u'if you expect the outside to be hundred percent the way you want it ', u'you re just not equipped to live here in this world ', u'yes or no ', u'if you re expecting the external situations to go hundred percent my way ', u'obviously i m not equipped to live in this world ', u'you know we are a volunteer organization ', u'over 4000 full time volunteers ', u'over three million part time volunteers ', u'every day somebody is coming up to me and saying ', u" sadhguru  i can t take her anymore  i can't take it ", u'this person  i can t work with this person ', u'this man is like this  this woman is like that ', u'i tell them ', u' see  this is the kind of people that exist in the world ', u'if you think what you re doing is very significant ', u'you ve got to work with these people ', u'however they are ', u'if you want to work with ideal people ', u'you must go to heaven  and today   ', u'these are our realities ', u'if you truly see  genuinely see that', u' what i m doing is significant ', u'it s of significant ', u'it s significant enough to make difference in lives around me ', u'now you have to do that work ', u'the problem is not of the nature of your work ', u'you just ask anybody  from the topmost job down to the most menial job ', u'everybody complains about stress ', u'so stress is not about your job ', u'i must tell you this ', u'a few years ago  many years ago ', u'when i first came to united states ', u'wherever i went  people were talking about stress management ', u'i couldn t understand this', u'because in my understanding ', u'we manage whatever is precious to us ', u'our family  our wealth  our business  our money ', u'why would anybody want to manage stress  ', u'it took me a while to understand ', u'people have concluded that stress is a part of their life ', u'stress is not a part of your life ', u'it s just your inability to manage your own thought ', u'your own emotion  your own energies and your own body ', u'if you knew ', u'if your mind took instructions from you ', u'would you live in stress or in bliss ', u'please tell me ', u' bliss ', u' what s your choice ', u'yes ', u'such a simple thing is not happening because', u'your mind is not even taking instructions from you ', u'if your intelligence turns against you  who the hell can save you  ', u'so this anxiety  this stress is not about the job ', u'it is just that', u'our education systems are such ', u'they are telling you how to conquer the world  you know ', u'how to break an invisible atom ', u'how to go beyond space ', u'but they re not telling you a thing about this one  ', u'this  is the most complex  ', u'if you want to call it a human mechanism  ', u'this  is the most complex and sophisticated mechanism you have seen ', u'yes ', u' yes ', u' as a doctor  you know ', u'but i m asking ', u'even the doctors ', u'have they read the user s manual  ', u'how to use this  ', u'no ', u'just by accident  something ', u'when you live by accident ', u'anxiety is natural ', u' so i was really interested in the title of your book  ', u'inner engineering   ', u'a yogi s guide to joy ', u'and those are some words that you don t usually see often so close together ', u'i m thinking about engineering ', u' and joy  ', u'  and joy ', u'  and a yogi  and a yogi  ', u' and a yogi  right ', u'engineering  yogi  you know ', u'and i like that word engineering ', u'you need to know  there are some really ', u'some of the top engineers at the university are in the audience tonight ', u' yesterday was the engineer s ', u' they re right there ', u' yesterday was the world engineer s day  ', u' yeah  so what s the ', u'what s the theme of ', u'what would you say is the message of this ', u'i mean  i think you re getting at that ', u'inner engineering   ', u'a yogi s guide to joy ', u'what does that mean ', u' see  if you ', u'if you and me were here let s say a hundred years ago', u'or two hundred years ago ', u'how the world was and how it is today ', u'it is almost another world ', u'it s not the same world ', u'you wouldn t have recognized it  that s how much it has changed ', u'what changed this ', u'our ability to engineer external situations the way we want it ', u'we could sit outside and do this', u'but now we re sitting in this building because this is engineered for our comfort ', u'now  engineering essentially means', u'making something just the way we want it ', u'we made everything in the world the way we want it ', u'but now fifty four percent burnout ', u'because we did not make this one thing  the way we want it ', u'if we made this one thing  the way we want it ', u'again the same question  ', u'would you live blissfully or miserably ', u'if you made this  the way you want it ', u'you would definitely make this blissful ', u'highest level of pleasantness for yourself ', u'what you want for your neighbor may be debatable ', u'but what you want for yourself is very clear  isn t it ', u'so  this is not happening because', u'we have never approached inner well being in a scientific manner ', u'we are thinking something else from somewhere is going to fix this ', u'if we want to be well  we looked up ', u'in india  they call this uparwala ', u'that means the one above ', u'i m saying ', u'is it true that you are living on a round planet ', u'hello ', u'is it a round planet that we are living on ', u' and on top of it  it s spinning ', u'if you look up  you re invariably looking up in the wrong direction  isn t it  ', u'i m ', u'you must go to australia  to look up the right way ', u'so i m saying we are simply even incapable of knowing what is up and down in this universe ', u'is it somewhere marked in this cosmos  ', u'this side up  ', u'we not only do not know  we cannot know  isn t it ', u'so we don t even know which is up  which is down ', u'we do not know what is forward  what is backward ', u'we really do not know what is east  what is west ', u'for convenience  we made up things ', u'but there is one thing that you can know  right now ', u'there is a perspective ', u'there is inward and there is outward ', u'we have been just busy fixing the outside ', u'you fix the outside as much as you want ', u'all you will get is comfort and convenience ', u'you will not get well being ', u'if well being has to happen ', u'you have to engineer your interiority the way you want it ', u'only when this  becomes the way you want ', u'now this will be joyful ', u' if outside becomes the way i want  there will be comfort ', u'you have to admit this  ', u'never before in the history of humanity ', u'any other generation knew the kind of comforts and convenience', u'that you and me are enjoying right now ', u'yes or no ', u'hmm ', u' yes ', u' we are the most comfortable generation ever ', u'but we are whining like crazy  ', u' let s talk about the inner life and the outer life ', u'one thing that strikes me as so powerful about your mission in the world is', u'that you seem to successfully broker both of those worlds ', u' oh  bro  you must take off the word broker  ', u' i guess ', u'how to say ', u'you successfully pursue both of those worlds ', u'if you will ', u'the isha foundation educates the young and plants trees ', u'and then you also teach people about inner engineering ', u'and i think that could be a challenge for', u' we  in the west ', u'we in the west perhaps love the outer world', u'and maybe at the expense of the inner world ', u'but i d love to hear your perspective on that ', u' see all these massive projects of health ', u'education and ecology that we re doing in southern india', u'have mainly happened only because of an inner experience ', u'there re millions of people who had a powerful inner experience ', u'it s out of that we are able to generate this action ', u'because these massive projects are all completely done by a volunteer force ', u'volunteers means ', u'nobody s trained for the job  ', u'and ', u'and you cannot fire them for inefficiency  because they re volunteers  ', u'at the same time ', u'even if they re holding a key position ', u'at any time without notice they can just vanish  ', u'you manage an organization like this  you will go crazy in no time ', u'that s my job  ', u'so  having described my job ', u'which is a sure route to madness  ', u'if i was not as well established as i am within myself ', u'it would have driven me bonkers ', u'because i ve managed businesses before', u'and at that time ', u'i used to wield my authority on people to get things going ', u'and the main thing was  they were on my', u'you know ', u'i was doing the payment for them ', u'that was the main control ', u'now i don t make any payment for anybody ', u'everybody is not paid ', u'nobody is paid ', u'in fact  they spend their own money and come and do everything ', u'to keep them going is essentially the inner engineering ', u'because there is a powerful experience within ', u'which drives them to do all this work ', u'it is ', u'it is unfortunate that people always trying to divide the world ', u'you must understand this ', u'that the very basic nature of human intellect is this', u'human intellect   you know  all of you  ', u'the sharper it is  the better it is  isn t it so ', u'you should agree with me  ', u'the sharper it is  the better it is  i think  intellect ', u' i actually wanna talk about being a prophet ', u' hey  don t go that far  let s finish the project  ', u' let s go there ', u'so  because one of the things about sort of', u'be mindful of the inner life ', u' mhmm  ', u'you cannot be mindful of the inner life ', u'now you talked about being a prophet ', u'now i can say no  ', u" so i don't think ", u'i wouldn t say you re a prophet ', u'i m talking about the judeo christian tradition of prophecy ', u' oh ', u'  so in the hebrew bible  in the old testament ', u'there is the role of those who speak truth to power ', u'who speak out against injustice ', u'who sacrifice themselves for a cause because of injustice ', u'and there in that narrative ', u'there is anger and there is rage ', u'and there are significant groups of people in the world ', u'in our country ', u'who have due cause to be angry about the world  ', u'the refugee ', u'the ethnic minority ', u'the poor ', u'and one thing about inner engineering', u'and sort of finding peace within oneself ', u'the other side of that coin is ', u'you know what ', u'is there ever a time to be angry ', u'to march ', u'to be enraged at the injustice of the world ', u'what would you say to that ', u' you know che  i know you ', u'this is not a popular name in america ', u'che guevara said   if you are in rage  you are one of us ', u'i said   if you are out of rage  you re one of us   ', u'if you re really out of rage ', u'you re definitely one of us ', u'because you think there is a reason for your anger ', u'which is a wrong perception ', u'if you look at it ', u'people get terribly angry with their loved ones ', u'there s a whole lot violence within the homes', u'because they get terribly angry with their loved ones ', u'somebody that they re living with ', u'and they have a good reason to get angry ', u'because she did not cook the breakfast properly ', u'or the dog peed where it s not supposed to pee ', u'or i have seen people yelling and screaming and breaking their clubs on a golf course ', u'where they re just having a good time  ', u'so i m saying everybody has a reason to be angry ', u'anger means just this ', u'when you re angry', u'as a doctor  you know today that when you re angry ', u'literally you re generating poison in the system  ', u'literally ', u'if you are poisoning yourself internally', u'and when you re angry ', u'you know you do the most idiotic things in your life ', u'when you turn back and see  you can t believe you did it ', u'but most idiotic things happen when you re angry ', u'so i m asking ', u'is it ', u'is anger an intelligent expression of human life', u'or an idiotic expression of human life ', u'hello ', u'idiotic ', u'so that s all you need to know  ', u'the next time you re angry  you just know you re stupid ', u'because you re turning against yourself ', u' so ', u' but  i will tell you ', u'the reason why this anger has been eulogized is ', u'in a moment of anger ', u'some people who were sleeping all their life propelled themselves into action', u'and that action produced some results ', u'yes  that can happen ', u'it may so happen  you know ', u'that if i throw a stone at you ', u'instead of hitting you ', u'it hit the apple in the tree and the apple fell into your hands ', u'but that s by accident ', u'generally  if i throw a stone ', u'your head will crack ', u'that s what is supposed to happen ', u'yes ', u'so i got angry and something got done ', u'so i think anger is a great way of doing things ', u'so when you re angry  you yell and fume at somebody ', u'i m asking all of you ', u'how many of you enjoy being yelled at and fumed by somebody else ', u'whether it s your boss ', u'or your husband ', u'or your wife ', u'or your parents or anybody ', u'you really thoroughly enjoyed this  ', u'hello ', u'did you ', u' no ', u' no ', u'and what makes you think somebody else enjoys it ', u'they endure you ', u'they don t enjoy you ', u'and when they re done  they re done  ', u'so  it doesn t matter', u'whether the anger happened to a man that you call as a prophet ', u'because we have a way of eulogizing everything', u'which ', u'with which we have a distance of time ', u'suddenly anything which is over 1000 years becomes sacred in most people s mind ', u'but whatever is happening right now ', u'however great it is ', u'they don t have the intelligence to recognize this ', u'people are saying the past things are great', u'simply because everybody else is saying it ', u'not because they truly recognize ', u'but we are coming to a time ', u'if you don t do it ', u'your children will do this ', u'that is ', u'a time is coming in the world ', u'where unless it makes sense', u'it doesn t come ', u'it doesn t matter from what source it comes from ', u'even if god comes and speaks here ', u'the next generation will reject it', u'unless it makes sense to them ', u'this is a good development because', u'instead of authority being the truth ', u'truth is becoming the authority ', u'it s a good way to go ', u'but once this happens ', u'questions are going to rise  ', u'all kinds of questions ', u'with all due respect to every religious tradition on the planet', u'i come from a land ', u'which has immense traditions ', u'unbelievable ', u'most ', u'most people in the world ', u'most indians are not even conscious of this ', u'how many traditions  how many ways are there in that land ', u'when mark twain came to india ', u'he said   anything that can ever be done either by man or god has been done in this land ', u'because the exploration is so incredible ', u'but with all due respect to all of them ', u'i say this ', u'that if you raise three fundamental questions ', u'ninety percent of the scriptural knowledge on the planet will collapse ', u'i m sorry ', u'but this is the truth ', u'if you ask three pertinent questions ', u'you will see ninety percent of the scriptural knowledge on the planet will just collapse ', u'it can t stand scrutiny ', u' so what are the three questions  ', u' you are not a scripture  so why should i  ', u' oh no  you said ask three questions ', u' yes  the fundamental questions ', u'if you ask  simply ', u'you  see  the fundamental thing is this  ', u'you don t know where you came from ', u'you don t know where you will go ', u'you can believe ', u'if we work hard enough on you ', u'we can make you believe anything ', u'you must know this ', u'i was just talking to a group of people in nashville  tennessee ', u'where our center is ', u'i was just telling them a joke ', u'in the joke ', u'i referred to god as him ', u'immediately  a few ladies stood up and said ', u' do you believe god is a man ', u'i said   whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa ', u'i know what i ve gotten into  you know  ', u'i said   i was just telling you a joke ', u'they said   it doesn t matter  you said him ', u'now this is a debate in america  ', u'is god a man or a woman ', u'i think this time in the election they re trying to settle that issue  ', u'but where we come from ', u'we have no such issue ', u'we have a man god ', u'we have a woman god ', u'we have a cow god ', u'we have an elephant god ', u'we have a snake god ', u'we have a bird god ', u'we have a dog god ', u'we have every kind ', u'crawling ones ', u'creeping ones ', u'flying ones  all kinds  ', u'because we are a very wise culture ', u'we foresaw all the future problems that may arise  ', u'and there is also a debate ', u'which in the last election they tried to settle ', u'but it did not settle  i think ', u'people are debating in southern churches  ', u'is god black or white ', u'it s a big serious debate happening ', u'people really debating about this  ', u'is god white or black ', u'well  you know idi amin  the uganda man ', u'idi amin declared   god is black ', u'i agree with him because', u'if a white man can have a white god ', u'why can t a black man have a black god ', u'but you know  these people do not know ', u'because in these parts of the world  only messiahs ', u'prophets  sons  others came ', u'they don t know ', u'in india  we know god is brown  ', u'yes ', u'because god himself visited india nine times ', u'are you aware of this  ', u'you didn t know ', u'god visited india nine times  himself ', u'indians are very proud of this ', u'because god visited us himself nine times', u'and he sent his son and messenger and others and others to other places  ', u'i keep reminding them  that s because', u'god wanted to do the job hands on with indians  ', u'he couldn t trust anybody else with indians  ', u'he came nine times and he failed  ', u' let s  let s talk about ', u' no  coming to belief   i m saying', u'we can make people believe anything', u'if you work upon them from their childhood  ', u'anything  believe me ', u'you just have to work hard enough', u'and make them believe this  that  everything ', u'belief gives you a confidence without clarity ', u'confidence without clarity is a disaster on this planet ', u'there is no substitute for clarity ', u'there is no substitute for clarity ', u'but if you have confidence  you can just do something just like that ', u'sometimes it works ', u'even if you re not clear ', u'you can simply do something and it ll work ', u'can i tell you a joke ', u' please ', u' this happened in new york city ', u'tch ', u'late afternoon ', u'a eight year old boy came back from school ', u'he had a very progressive mother ', u'obviously she was single  ', u'i m saying they couldn t ', u'nobody catch up with her  ', u'he came home and he asked ', u' momma  is god man or woman ', u'she thought about all the gender issues', u'and the coming election and everything', u'and then she thought about it for a while and she said ', u' both ', u'the boy went into deep thought ', u'after a little while  the boy came back and asked ', u' momma  is god black or white ', u'again she thought about all the racial issues in the country', u'and after considering this at length  she said ', u' both ', u'the boy went into very deep thought ', u'then after some time  he came back and asked ', u' momma  is god straight or gay ', u'she again thought about it and then she said ', u' both ', u'the boy jumped in joy ', u' i got it  i got it ', u'it s michael jackson   ', u'so how ', u'how we arrived at our belief has cultural backing ', u'every culture has made up their own stuff ', u'but i m asking ', u'do we genuinely know where we came from and where we re going ', u'if you re so clear where you re going ', u'that is for an appointment with the creator ', u'i don t think you should postpone the appointment ', u'you must take it today  isn t it ', u'but that s not true ', u'if death is next moment  you don t want to go ', u'if you are so sure', u'only that fanatic who blows himself up seems to be sure ', u'everybody else has a doubt  isn t it ', u'every s  working intelligence has a doubt ', u'yes or no ', u'if you have frozen your intelligence with overriding belief systems ', u'then you re going  ', u'every other working intelligence ', u'if death is next moment ', u'there is hesitation or no ', u'for sure  isn t it ', u'because you really don t know where you re going ', u'you can believe what you want ', u'but you really do not know ', u'belief is of social significance ', u'to some extent of psychological significance ', u'but existentially it means nothing ', u' can i ask your thoughts on this ', u'in some ways  in many ways  we are the inheritors of our traditions', u'and they can  and they do influence us and shape us ', u'is there a positive role for the traditions from whence we come ', u'for example ', u'if i m gonna try to inner engineer my inner life', u'and try to get some direction and meaning and faith and hope and values ', u'i can t do it alone ', u'and there are rich traditions ', u'hindu traditions ', u'judeo christian traditions ', u'muslim traditions', u'that give some context ', u'some meaning ', u'some structure upon which to anchor my life ', u'what do you think about that ', u'do we throw away all the traditions', u'and inner engineer our lives', u'or can we use these traditions ', u' as you said  to anchor our lives ', u'now that is ', u'that is the decision that every human being has to make ', u'do you want to be anchored', u'or do you want to set sail ', u'that is a decision that everybody has to make ', u'if you re looking for confidence ', u'if you re looking for stability ', u'then you have to anchor yourself to something ', u'if you re looking to go far ', u'then anchoring will not help ', u'traditions ', u'all traditions  ', u'with all due respect to all of them  ', u'particularly traditions that are coming from india and also elsewhere  ', u'i m  i m not in any way an expert on  to make a comment on the traditions', u'that you re talking about', u'but essentially  tradition means this  ', u'what somebody did yesterday is today s culture and tradition ', u'what you do today is tomorrow s culture and tradition ', u'i m asking you ', u'how much of what we re doing today in this world and in this country', u'is consciously cultured ', u'but all the rubbish that we do ', u'will become tomorrow s culture and tradition of this land ', u'isn t it so ', u'hello ', u' yes ', u' i m saying  do you believe that people who lived here 1000 years ago', u'were such super human beings ', u'they did everything perfectly and you re doing everything wrong ', u'it s not so ', u'they were also just people like you ', u'we have a way of eulogizing everything', u'with which we have a certain distance of time ', u'but are they of no value ', u'not true ', u'there re a whole lot of things ', u'whole lot of things', u'that we as human beings simply know today ', u'which is thanks to the traditions in which we have grown up ', u'we cannot say no ', u'but if you want to know this life  which is myself ', u'no tradition is ', u'tradition can inspire you ', u'tradition can put you in a direction ', u'tradition cannot take you there ', u'because this has to happen now  to you  only then it s a living reality for you ', u'otherwise you will read in a book and believe it ', u'but how do you know this works ', u'i m saying it should work ', u'people ask me ', u' sadhguru  how do we know whether we have met a real teacher or a guru or not ', u'i just tell them ', u' look at his face  whether it s worked for him  what he s talking  ', u'has it worked for him ', u'that s all the question ', u'if it s worked for him  it doesn t matter what it is ', u'you must go with him because it s worked for him ', u'if it s not worked for him  what is the point ', u'dead tradition ', u' so one of the traditions here in a medical school ', u'in a western medical school ', u'is the tradition of the evidence  ', u'show me ', u'in this tradition ', u'which is only really maybe two or three hundred years old ', u'the randomized controlled trial ', u'the cohort study  the  all of that ', u'and it s good ', u'that s how we ve gotten cures for pneumonia', u'and drugs to help alleviate pain', u'and it s all been done through this pursuit of the evidence ', u'the evidence ', u'and also i m a pastor', u'and i fully embrace the life of the spirit', u'and the truth that we find in our faith traditions ', u'and i love that tradition ', u'but i do recognize a tension ', u'if you will ', u'between the truth that we discover in the lab', u'and the truth that we discover in our spirit ', u'and i love that tension ', u'i think that s a great way to live in a way ', u'that sort of loving and joyful pursuit that is', u'both the truth that i see around me and the love that grows in my heart ', u'but i do recognize the tension ', u'what is your perception of that ', u' see  when we talk about the evidence based approach ', u'it is not a tradition ', u'when it happened ', u'when the renaissance happened  it was breaking of all traditions ', u'till then  because it was written in a book ', u'because a certain authority was espousing it ', u'we said   this is it ', u'when medical science evolved from jenner  to others ', u'the fundamental thing was they broke all tradition ', u'so now if that is becoming a tradition ', u'i m very sorry ', u'because this was an exploration ', u'an exploration cannot be traditional ', u'an exploration means you re constantly trying to step into new terrain ', u'that s what an exploration is ', u'but if that has become traditional ', u'then we are treading the same track and thinking it s exploration ', u'this evidence based approach has done wonders to many many things', u'no question', u'but this entire process is dependent upon human intellect ', u'this is what  we are just coming into', u'we went off little bit', u'human intellect by nature', u'i am just asking you', u'would you like it sharp or blunt', u'if you want sharp', u"if you have a sharp instrument let's say you have a knife in your hand", u'what could you do to this flower', u'with a knife ', u'you could cut it finely if you want but', u'you can cut into pieces', u"that's exactly what the intelligence does", u'whatever you give it it will cut it open and try to see', u'the way of evidence based science is disection fundamentally', u'well  even in the medical school  i m sure', u'we re', u'in the pathology labs we are opening up ', u'fortunately the dead  ', u'but if you really want to know somebody ', u'someone whom you love very much ', u'if you really want to know them ', u'i think you should dissect them to know them ', u'would it work like that ', u'no  obviously ', u'so  there is one dimension of life ', u'which is physical in nature ', u'where dissection will work ', u'but what is physical about you ', u'the body that you carry ', u'is an accumulation that you gathered over a period of time ', u'it s just the food that you ve eaten ', u'it is actually a piece of the planet ', u'most people don t get this when they re walking ', u'but the countless number of people who walked on this planet before you and me ', u'they are all topsoil today ', u'you and me also will be topsoil ', u'unless your friends choose to bury you real deep  ', u'fearing that you may raise from the dead  ', u'this is just the soil  isn t it ', u'hello ', u'tch ', u'this is just the soil that you walk upon ', u'so this is an accumulation ', u'what you gather ', u'what you accumulate ', u'you can claim   it is mine ', u'you cannot say   it s me  isn t it ', u'right now  as i m speaking ', u'i say   this is my glass ', u'you will think ', u' oh  sadhguru seems to have a problem  ', u'but let s listen  everybody says he s wise   ', u'after some time i ll say   this is me ', u'then you will say   let s go home   ', u'because if i claim this is me  you know it is ', u'it qualifies for madness  isn t it ', u'whatever you acquire ', u'you can say   this is mine ', u'but if you say   this is me  this is madness ', u'yes or no ', u'are there any psychiatrists ', u'do i  do this ', u'does this qualify  ', u'it does ', u'so  every day you re doing this ', u'food appeared on your plate  you said   this is my food ', u'you ate it and then you say   it s me ', u'this is madness ', u'but you have enormous company  ', u'and we believe in democracy ', u'whatever the majority says must be right ', u'so  it is going on ', u'but the moment you believe something that is not you as yourself ', u'you kind of lost it ', u'you re derailed from life ', u'so  turning inward does not mean dissection ', u'turning inward does not mean contemplation', u'because the content of your body', u'and the content of your mind is an accumulated substance  isn t it ', u'you gathered it from outside ', u'what you gather from outside can be yours', u'but can never ever be you ', u'so  we re talking about inner engineering ', u'not as twisting and turning the body ', u'not about taking on new attitudes of love or generosity  compassion ', u'whatever great values and emotions that a human being can have ', u'i see all that as a consequence of a certain way of being ', u'rather than looking at it as a means to get somewhere ', u'everywhere  people are talking about whatever ', u'see  if you deprive somebody of something for a period of time ', u'simply qualities will raise to heaven ', u'today  anywhere you go  people are talking ', u' peace of mind is the ultimate goal of human life ', u'why ', u'because they re freaked out in their minds  ', u'why would peace be the highest goal ', u'because you re talking about judeo christian thing ', u'the origin of where it came from', u'i happened to be in tel aviv ', u'i am to ', u'30 in the evening ', u'i was flying in from atlanta ', u'because of some delays in the flights ', u'00 in the evening ', u'so  i m quickly changing in the airport', u'because in these thirty five years ', u'i ve not been late to a single appointment ', u'i don t want to break that ', u'so i m rushing ', u'and i am famished', u'because i m traveling an american airline', u'and there s nothing edible on the plane  ', u'i m super hungry', u'and i rush to the venue ', u'and to my joy ', u'i find the talk is in a fine restaurant ', u'life can t get better  ', u'so as i went in ', u'people are greeting me and one man comes up and says ', u' shalom ', u'i ask him   what does it mean ', u'he says   this is the highest way of greeting ', u'i said   well  that s your opinion  but what does it mean ', u'he said   no  this is the highest way of greeting ', u'i said   that s all right  but what does the word mean ', u'he said   it means peace ', u'i said   why would peace be the highest way of greeting ', u'unless you re born in middle east   ', u'in south india ', u'you come up to me in the morning and say   peace ', u'i ll say   what s wrong with you   ', u' i d like to get back to the practice of medicine', u'just for a question really ', u'i tell my gang ', u'whom i adore', u'my residents ', u'my students are close to my heart ', u'i adore them ', u' all gangs are like that  ', u' and i say ', u'i say medicine is easy ', u'medicine is easy', u'but healing is hard because in medicine ', u'we have our potions and if we don t know an answer ', u'we do a test and if we don t know the ', u'what the test means  we consult somebody ', u'and so medicine  in some ways ', u'we can distill it down ', u'we can make it easy ', u'but healing ', u'healing is really where the art of medicine lies ', u'and healing is where the spirit and the love and the suffering', u'and the treatments and the surgery ', u'that s where it all comes together ', u'how would you propose that we adopt a healing attitude ', u'how do we bring the spirit of healing', u'into the experience of the bedside ', u' please  all of you ', u'don t be offended by what i say', u'but you must look at this properly ', u'if i ', u'i  i don t ', u'but if at any time ', u'if it becomes necessary i must go to a hospital ', u'i just want efficient treatment ', u'i don t want love ', u'because i m not deprived like that ', u'now unfortunately ', u'we are creating a population', u'where everywhere people are talking about love ', u'we are deprived like this because', u'early age deprivation of love will tell right through your life ', u'it is very important ', u'we need to understand', u'that there is something more to this life ', u'than the acquired body ', u'we have a body  which we acquired ', u'there s something more ', u'there is a whole tradition in india', u'unfortunately  it s rapidly vanishing because of variety of changes', u'that are happening in the society ', u'otherwise  how a mother should deal with a child', u'till the child is four and a half years of age ', u'in the ', u'in the vernacular languages ', u'it says that she should wrap herself around the child ', u'in every possible way ', u'not', u'because the food that you give the child ', u'the milk that you give the child is not the only nourishment ', u'the child needs to be wrapped with motherhood ', u'then only this child will grow as a full fledged child ', u'otherwise  it will grow as a deprived child ', u'but modern societies ', u'we are going to a place  which is almost impossible to deliver this ', u'it s simply not possible ', u'in the way we have structured our families ', u'it s simply not possible to do that ', u'so  having said that ', u'when people come to a hospital ', u'they should just look forward to efficient treatment ', u'now we re looking for love ', u'we should have found it somewhere else ', u'at least we should have bought a dog  ', u'if you couldn t find anybody ', u'dog is  you know ', u'if you get yourself a dog  twelve years guaranteed love affair ', u'guaranteed ', u'doesn t matter how badly behaved you are ', u'still it s guaranteed ', u'it ll not work with any human being  ', u'there s a whole lot of management to do with human beings ', u'if you get a dog ', u'however badly behaved you are ', u'you are a drunk  you behave badly ', u'you beat him  do what you do ', u'but the dog still loves you', u'guaranteed love affair ', u'so  those of you who are looking for love wherever you go ', u'dog is a good solution  ', u'when you go to a hospital ', u'you don t expect your doctor to love you ', u'just do what he has to do  ', u' so that is fascinating ', u'because i think patients come to their doctors ', u' this  this is the unfortunate', u'this is the unfortunate reality  that s what i m saying ', u'people come to a hospital and looking for love  ', u'wrong place  ', u' so when i was a', u'when i was a medical student ', u'i was the pastor of a church here in town', u'and i would write my sermons on hospital notepaper ', u'this was before emrs  ', u'so i m writing my sermon at the nurse s station', u'and my attending physician came up to me and he said ', u' doolittle  physicians are the priests of today ', u'i said   what ', u'what do you mean ', u'that s offensi  i wasn t sure what ', u'was he joking', u'was he serious ', u'and he was serious  ', u'in the sense that people come to their doctor and they have pain', u'and maybe it s back pain ', u"may be it's pain in their hearts", u'and i think people come to their physician', u'and they look for absolution', u'acceptance  forgiveness ', u'they look to feel well again ', u'and perhaps the critique of modern medicine is that', u'we are trained to give a pill but people want more ', u'and it s interesting that you bring this up that in modern medicine', u'the expectation should be efficient care  safe care ', u'and that s what we re trying to do too ', u'but i do think ', u' there is a healing', u' maybe the world is becoming more secular', u'and they don t know where to turn', u'and so people look to their healthcare provider', u'for all of it ', u'what do you think ', u' see  it s not about being secular or non secular ', u'a whole lot of human beings are feeling lonely ', u' yes ', u' right from their childhood  they ve suffered loneliness ', u'for variety of reasons ', u'changes have happened in family structure ', u'changes have happened in the social structure ', u'the communities of the past have broken ', u'so  there is a certain loneliness ', u'where even if they go to a  their car mechanic ', u'they want to be loved  ', u'you must go to your physician', u'just the way you went to a car mechanic ', u'somebody who knows how to fix the car ', u'that s important ', u'whether he loves you or not is not your business ', u'but when you talk about healing ', u'there s another dimension ', u'we re preparing people like this ', u'i m bringing up hundreds of people ', u'where we have identified in the yogic culture', u'i mean  in the yogic science  ', u'the fundamental life energy manifests itself in five different ways ', u'five fundamental ways ', u'these five', u'out of these five ', u'this is called as', u'prana vayu ', u'samana vayu ', u'apana ', u'udhana', u'and vyana ', u'in this  there is one dimension called samana vayu ', u'which is very healing ', u'so  before we introduce any kind of medical knowledge to a person ', u'we put them on very serious inner work', u'to generate a certain level of samana vayu ', u'where a physician develops such a level of vitality ', u'if he walks into the room ', u'everything should light up ', u'this is very important ', u'physicians are walking into the patient s room with a grave face ', u'grave is one thing that you should not point at when somebody is sick  ', u'grave is one thing that you don t show a patient ', u'a physician should generate such a level of vitality', u'and life and healthfulness about themselves ', u'anything they touch will get better  naturally', u'not because of love  not because of compassion ', u'people  you know ', u'yesterday i was being interviewed by a young lady', u'and she said ', u' sadhguru  we must  you know ', u'everything should happen out of compassion ', u'i asked her   are you married ', u'she said   yes  my husband is waiting in the reception ', u'i said   suppose when you go there after this interview ', u'you realize', u'that your husband married you on a compassionate basis  ', u'would you like it ', u'she said  no   ', u'then why do you want it for me  ', u'i don t need it too ', u' so can i ask you with ', u'so for the isha foundation ', u'with the thousands of full time volunteers', u'and the millions of part time volunteers ', u'why do you think they come ', u' tools of transformation ', u'the tools are subjective in nature ', u'see  right now ', u'we as human beings are dominating this world', u'only because of our ability to use tools ', u'otherwise  a pack of dogs would take care of you ', u'forget about the tigers and the lions', u'poor tigers and poor lions  who need to be saved right now ', u'only because of our ability to use tools  isn t it ', u'and all the tools that we developed are ', u'now as a doctor ', u'maybe you re using a microscope ', u'we have a microscope  only because we are ability ', u'our ability to see ', u'to enhance that we have a scope ', u'we have a telescope only to enhance our vision in some other way ', u'we have a telephone because we can hear ', u'we have a microphone because we can speak ', u'we have a bicycle because we can walk ', u'if we were made like trees ', u'would we have invented a bicycle  i m asking ', u'every tool that we created is only in  to enhance the already existing faculties to a higher level  isn t it ', u'everything ', u'everything that we invented is just this  all the tools ', u'the tools are very important ', u'when i refer to the spiritual dimension as tools ', u'some of our people will feel offended around me and say ', u' sadhguru  don t say it  it is more than our life ', u'don t use the word tool ', u'then i tell them ', u' you come to the yoga center ', u'three days i will give you plumbing job ', u'no spanner  no wrench  no nothing ', u'you do it with your hands ', u'you can use your teeth  ', u'you will see all your ten nails will be gone ', u'then a few teeth will be gone after three days ', u'then you come to me  i will give you a spanner ', u'will you worship the spanner or no ', u'i m asking you ', u'will you worship the spanner or no ', u'it is the tools ', u'similarly  to turn inward ', u'to extend dimensions which you re you re', u'every one of you have known peace in your life at some moment ', u'hello ', u'you must tell me yes or no ', u' you have known joy in your life ', u' you have known bliss in your life ', u' you have known ecstasy in your life ', u'love in your life ', u'you are capable of all these things ', u'only thing is it s not sustainable ', u'one moment there  one moment here  one moment there  one moment here  ', u'this is the only problem  isn t it ', u'suppose i gave you a tool ', u'subjective tool', u'with which you can remain blissful every moment of your life ', u'is it of great value to you  i m asking ', u' so  these millions of people ', u'they have tasted the tools of transformation ', u'one thing i have done to them is  ', u'i have confused the hell out of them  ', u' so what is that tool of transformation ', u'how would you describe that ', u' this is the first tool ', u'first thing is  you must get confused  ', u'yes  because you are talking about anchoring  that s why i m saying this ', u'confusion means you realize that you do not know  isn t it ', u'i m asking  with all this exploration of science ', u'do we know even one single atom in its entirety ', u'hello ', u'do we ', u'no ', u'then what s our problem in saying we don t know ', u' i do not know  is an immense possibility ', u'now  you re trying to destroy  i do not know ', u'with all kinds of beliefs ', u'why don t you say   i do not know ', u'if you truly realize  i do not know ', u'your intelligence will be in a active and super alert state every moment of your life ', u'the moment you believe  it sleeps ', u'it lets you sleep ', u'but people are not willing to go through this ', u'they want something ', u'tell them something  they want to believe and say   i m fine ', u'i want to sleep tonight ', u'no ', u' i do not know ', u'if you see  i do not know ', u'the longing to know ', u'the wanting to know ', u'the seeking to know will happen to you ', u'everything that you do not know  you just believe', u'because somebody said so ', u'even if it is true', u'right now  i m going to tell you what is the truth ', u'but it s not in your experience ', u'so what is the options that you have ', u'you can believe me or you can disbelieve me  isn t it ', u'if you believe me  you will not get any closer to truth ', u'if you disbelieve me  you will not get any closer to truth ', u'it is just that if you believe me  you will have a positive story to tell ', u'if you disbelieve me  you will have a negative story to tell ', u'but you will not move an inch existentially ', u'psychologically  it will give you comfort ', u'so this is something you must decide ', u'are you looking for solace ', u'or are you looking for a solution ', u'if you re looking for solution  then you need tools to turn inward ', u'if you re looking for solace  believe something ', u' so if the first step is  i don t know ', u'what do you do then ', u'what happens after that  ', u' see  this happened to me when i was just four  four and a half years of age ', u'suddenly one day  i realized i don t know a thing ', u'i was only about four and a half years of age ', u'if somebody gave me a glass of water ', u'i would just sit like this for three four hours at a stretch', u'because i wouldn t know what is water ', u'i m telling you  even today you don t know what is water ', u'it is the only substance  which is in all the three states on the planet ', u'two thirds of your body is water ', u'two thirds of the planet is water ', u'but you don t know what it is ', u'we know how to use it but we don t know what it is ', u'isn t it so ', u'we know how to use this water in so many ways', u'but we do not know what it really is ', u'because we do not know what really anything is for that matter ', u'so if i found a leaf ', u'i would simply sit like this for six seven hours ', u'if i sat up in the bed ', u'entire night i would be staring at the darkness ', u'my dear father  who is a physician  ', u'started thinking i need psychiatric evaluation', u'he started saying   this boy has lost it ', u'he s just staring at something all the time ', u'my problem is  i look at this and i don t know this ', u'i m not able to shift my attention to that ', u'i m just looking here still ', u'he thought he could educate me ', u'he tried ', u'so  there is a rule  strict rule in the house', u'00  dinner time  you ', u'all the children  four of us siblings ', u'we have to sit and read some textbook ', u'i open my textbook like this  ', u'i find a little speck on the paper ', u'i just look at the paper   ', u'this speck keeps me engaged for two hours ', u'i sit like this  absolutely total attention ', u'without reading a word ', u'i went through school like this ', u'i was very consistent ', u'i always got six zeros in every test  ', u' so if  if it s not shalom ', u'or compassion or love  ', u' it is just life ', u'  it s just  what would you  is that what you say the meaning of ', u' it s just life ', u'  the meaning  the purpose ', u' no  no ', u'  your purpose of life  is life  what would you say ', u' the purpose of life is life itself ', u' yeah ', u' is  life itself is a large enough phenomena it doesn t need another meaning ', u'only because human beings have not experienced life ', u'they re just a bundle of thoughts  emotions ', u'ideas  opinions ', u'identities and prejudices ', u' sadhguru ', u' because of this  they re looking for a meaning', u'because they re psychological scape has overshadowed the existential life that they are ', u'right now  all that they re experiencing is a minimalistic mind  not life ', u'if you look at life ', u'what is the nature of life ', u'as you sit there ', u'we are breathing for sure ', u'hello ', u' those who are not will need medical attention  ', u'we re breathing ', u'breathing means in some way  this life  is in communication with the entire atmosphere ', u'in fact  this ', u'this green  you know ', u'project greenhands of planting trees ', u'the entire movement was instigated like this by me ', u'i took a bunch of people ', u'about 3 4000 people came ', u'i said   all of you should come ', u'they came  i arranged a meeting in a village ', u'there was a big tree  a rain tree  a few  three  four trees were there ', u'large trees ', u'but i arranged the meeting around eleven o clock in the hot sun in southern india ', u'so i stood there and i am speaking to them  they are all   sitting like this ', u'slowly as the sun gets hotter  hotter  they re just wilting away ', u'and i m speaking and speaking something  telling them stories', u'and i m watching how they re just wilting away ', u'see  walking in the sun is one thing ', u'if you simply sit there  it ll just burn you down ', u'they re just thinking ', u' what s happened to sadhguru ', u'he s become like this  heartless   ', u'then after about an hour and a half  when they re really going down ', u'then i say   get up all of you  and i  then i walk them under the shade of the tree ', u' ahh ', u'you know what a tree is only if you sit in the sun  in hot sun  for an hour and a half  two ', u'then walk under the tree ', u'it feels like paradise ', u'they all    hahh ', u'i made them sit down and said ', u' see  what you exhale  the trees are inhaling  what the trees exhale  you are inhaling ', u'look at this ', u'one part of your lung is hanging out there ', u'and i created a process with which they could experience this ', u'they just sat there like this with tears in their eyes', u'and that is it  project greenhands  twenty seven million trees they have planted ', u' yeah  very nice ', u' now you can t stop them  ', u'they re planting and planting', u'because now they see it s a part of them ', u'is it not true that you exist here as a part of everything else ', u'it is just that it s a privilege ', u'though you are a speck in the universe ', u'less than a speck ', u'still we are given an intellect ', u'we have been given senses of perception ', u'we can experience this like an individual ', u'but in reality ', u'if you observe yourself ', u'you cannot exist by yourself even for a  a nanosecond  isn t it ', u'the entire universe is supporting you ', u'so the only way life can happen is an inclusive way ', u'so yoga means just this ', u'the word yoga means union ', u'union means the boundaries of what is inward and outward  you took it away ', u'there is no such thing as you and the other ', u'if you sit here ', u'we can do an experiment actually ', u'i don t know if time allows ', u'if you sit here and suppose for one moment ', u'you experienced all these people here as a part of yourself ', u'like you experience the five fingers of your hand ', u'how is that possible ', u'well  what is this body today  yesterday it was not your body  isn t it ', u'it was food ', u'today it s become body ', u'so something that is not you  became you  how ', u'right now  there is water  this is not you ', u'if i drink it  does it become me ', u'definitely does ', u'so what is it that i have done ', u'i included it into the boundaries of my sensations ', u'what is within my boundaries of sensation  i experience as myself ', u'what is outside of my boundaries of sensation is not me ', u'now  the yogic system ', u'we developed a way that if you keep your energies in a certain level of exuberance ', u'now you will see your sensory body will expand ', u'if your sensory body became as large as this hall', u'and you experienced all these people as yourself ', u'after that do i have to tell you ', u' love them ', u'don t hate them ', u'don t kill them ', u'don t harm them ', u'be compassionate ', u'would teachings be necessary for you ', u'if you experience something as a part of yourself ', u'after that you don t need any morality ', u'you don t need any ethic ', u'you don t need any values ', u'what is you  you will always handle it right ', u'what is you  it is of the highest concern to you ', u'if you experienced everyone and everything as yourself ', u'this is what yoga means ', u'if one is in such a state of union ', u'then you call him a yogi ', u'if you turn and twist your body and hang upside down  you are not a yogi ', u'you are just doing circus  ', u'yes  unfortunately  people think by turning and twisting they re doing yoga ', u'no ', u'yoga means you sat here ', u'you experience the entire universe as yourself  ', u'not as a hallucination but as a living experience ', u'not in the firmament of your mind but existentially you know this is you ', u'now you don t need any policy ', u"you don't need any morality ", u'you don t need any scripture ', u'you don t need any guidance from anywhere ', u'you will conduct this  sensibly', u'to the best of your intelligence and capability ', u'and that s all a human being can do ', u' sadhguru ', u'so we ve reached ', u' my question is touching back to the point which you brought up about the belief ', u'can you tell a little bit more about', u'what s the difference between belief and faith  ', u' you re trying to gather more information  ', u' as much as i can in one hour ', u' that is the biggest problem ', u'you can gather as much as you want  you could', u'if you gather a lot  you ll become fat ', u'but you will not feel enhanced ', u'the only thing that every life is seeking is to enhance itself to its fullest possible level ', u'whether you take a worm  or an insect  or a bird or a tree ', u'all of them want to become full fledged life ', u'only problem is ', u'we know what is a full fledged worm ', u'we know what is a full fledged insect ', u'we know what is a full fledged tree ', u'but we don t know what is a full fledged human being ', u'now you think by acquiring more and more ', u"i don't know what information you gathered ", u'but by acquiring more and more ', u'you will not become more ', u'it has not happened  isn t it ', u'people thought by acquiring money ', u'by acquiring wealth ', u'by acquiring knowledge they will become more ', u'they have not become more ', u'they re still hankering for the same things ', u'so  by acquiring more information ', u'you will not become enhanced ', u'it is just that if you approach information sensibly ', u'you will become more hungry ', u'if you approach information as a way of projecting yourself as better than somebody else ', u'then you will think you have attained to something ', u'this is what happens by acquiring information ', u'only in comparison  it s valuable ', u'if you have certain level of information ', u'you need somebody around you who doesn t know it for you to be looking smart ', u'yes  ', u'today  it s become a fashion ', u'before they go to a dinner party  they will google out', u'that galaxy z67  how many million light years is it ', u'so when you go to a dinner party ', u'just like that casually you throw around  ', u' you know the galaxy z67 ', u'it is you know how many light years ', u'this many light years ', u'who the hell cares  ', u'because we don t even know in our experience what is a light year  ', u'it is only a mathematical calculation ', u'it is not really anybody s experience ', u'there is no human being on this planet  past or present ', u'who s ever experienced a light year ', u'there s no such thing ', u'it is only a mathematic calculation', u'to somehow come to terms with the immeasurable dimensions of the existence ', u'we re trying to somehow quantify it ', u'so that it comes into our understanding ', u'but nothing comes into our understanding ', u'as science explores more and more ', u'it is only getting more confounded ', u'the only reason why science is surviving is', u'because it s throwing out useful technologies on the side ', u'if that was not there ', u'science is far more confused in hundred years of exploration than it ever was before ', u'but that s a good sign ', u'if they had made stupid conclusions ', u'they would be a one more religion ', u'science is confounded today ', u'the top physicists in the world are saying ', u' we not only do not know ', u'we know we will never know ', u'  this is a good sign because', u'this means your intelligence will remain on an explorative mode all the time  ', u'on an active mode ', u'not in a sleep mode ', u'so  when', u'when the top scientists declare ', u' we will not know ', u'it is not a hopeless situation ', u'it is a great situation that people have come to this ', u'that they understand if you go through physical means ', u'it doesn t matter how much you explore  it ll go on endlessly ', u'how much information you have  you will not get any better ', u'you will get only more burdened by this ', u'things will happen on the side  technologies will come ', u'iphone will become seven  eight  twelve  all right ', u'but still  the way you talk to people is not going to change  ', u'what you say will not change ', u'your relationships will not change ', u'technology can go through the ceiling', u'but nothing of you will be enhanced ', u'so  more information ', u'more information is not going to help ', u'all i want you to take  ', u'the takeaway for you', u'because you want to take away something   ', u'the takeaway for you is', u'if you truly  genuinely  ', u'it s not simply a thought  ', u'allow this to sink into you in the next few days ', u'that if you pay attention to anything ', u'a leaf ', u'a flower ', u'water ', u'people ', u'dog ', u'animals ', u'anything  anything ', u'if you pay enough attention to anything around you ', u'even the closest people around you ', u'if you pay enough attention to them ', u'you will see you don t know a damn thing about anything ', u'on the surface  you seem to know everything ', u'but if you pay sufficient attention ', u"you don't know a thing about anything ", u'knowledge is a very limited sphere of life ', u'ignorance is boundless ', u'enjoy that  ', u' so  in the spirit of boundless ignorance ', u'does anyone else have any questions ', u'there s a lot ', u'maybe someone', u' she has the microphone  yeah  ', u' yeah  you got the mike  go ahead ', u' hello ', u'thank you very much for a wonderful lecture', u'and you re definitely very smart man  ', u'my question is ', u' that s the worst insult anybody has thrown at me  ', u' he started by saying he doesn t know anything ', u'that was his whole ', u' maybe this is the main sign of a smart person ', u'so my question is that you mentioned before that', u'just belief without clarity is not a good thing ', u'and i m absolutely impressed by amount of volunteers ', u'like millions of the volunteers ', u'i cannot even imagine how many people come flown in and not volunteer', u'and so it s a lot ', u'do you think they are all driven by clarity and search for clarity ', u'or they believe that once they will do inner engineering ', u'they will work on the process of gaining joy', u'and eventually they will have a positive story with you', u'or the positive story  as you mentioned before ', u'thank you ', u' see  if ', u'for any human being to do something ', u'either it should have worked for them ', u'or it should have worked for somebody around them ', u'if you want to buy a car ', u'either you will test drive it and see whether it works for you', u'or you ll ask the opinion of your friend who is driving that particular car ', u' is this been good for you ', u'yes or no ', u'so i must tell you  a  as a rule ', u'for the first twenty  twenty one years of my existence as a teacher ', u'as a rule ', u'i never appeared in the media  ', u'never once   ', u'to a point  where media started writing about me ', u' he s running some kind of a secret school  ', u'because i refused to meet the media ', u'no advertisement ', u'no any kind of posters ', u'not even a brochure ', u'only by word of mouth  millions of people came ', u'because once it works for somebody ', u'they want it to work for their family ', u'their friends and things ', u'that s how it happened ', u'in the last fifteen years or sixteen years now  ', u'fifteen actually  ', u'from 2001 is when you have heard about me all over', u'because we re making a lot of noise in the last fifteen years ', u'because these projects ', u'which we started as small endeavors in the local area ', u'caught on so well and they became such major projects of planting trees ', u'education  health', u'we are active in 53 000 villages ', u'so  it needs enormous support ', u"otherwise this can't be done ", u'for a  a non religious movement ', u'which doesn t offer any miracles like this', u'never before  as i know  in the last two hundred  three hundred years ', u'never before  a spiritual movement has caught on this kind of following ', u'where no ticket to heaven ', u'no miracles ', u'no any kind of stuff ', u'only thing i m telling them is ', u'badgering them that you are the source of all your troubles  ', u'nobody else but you ', u'but millions are gathering ', u'which is very  fantastic because', u'i must tell you this ', u'about thirty years ago  when i conducted programs ', u'over eighty five percent of the people came because of health reasons  ', u'physical  mental ailments ', u'today  on an average ', u'only about twelve percent of the people are coming for health reasons ', u'the rest are coming because they re seeking ', u'they want to know ', u'they want to experience ', u'they want their lives to be touched in a deeper way than the way it is touched right now ', u'this is a phenomenal change that you re seeing in the world ', u'it s never before  i think ', u'only twelve percent are coming for health reasons ', u'but at one time ', u'over eighty percent were coming for health reasons ', u'which is a big shift ', u' any other question ', u'maybe someone from up above there ', u'you re right there in the front ', u'can you shout your question out ', u' i was wondering if physical ailments or health related physical ailments', u'can be cured by or at least helped by yoga ', u' there are ', u'we must understand  there are two kinds of ailments ', u'in the yogic system  we look at health issues as two ways ', u'one is caused by external organisms ', u'which i think modern medicine has handled in a phenomenal way ', u'in fact  the birth of modern medicine happened mainly', u'because of the epidemics and pandemics  which were happening at that time ', u'where it would wipe out populations ', u'it is that which inspired people to experiment', u'and do the things that they did ', u'and when they found solutions  that is when suddenly the ', u'the trust of the population shifted from one to another ', u'simply because they could eliminate epidemics', u'and these were caused by external organisms ', u'but seventy percent of human ailments are on self help ', u'that is  they cause it to themselves in so many ways ', u'for whatever reasons  knowingly  unknowingly ', u'they do it to themselves ', u'this seventy percent of ailments that people cause to themselves', u'can be undone from within ', u'but if you have an infection ', u'you must go to the doctor ', u'if you have pneumonia  you must immediately go to the doctor  ', u'don t try to do yoga  ', u'now  are there instances ', u'we have thousands and thousands of people ', u'i would say hundreds and thousands of people ', u'who walked out of their ailments', u'without ever being treated for them ', u'we don t treat people for yoga ', u'i must tell you this because we are in a medical institution ', u'a bunch of doctors from united states came to our yoga center ', u'we were ', u'we have a yogic hospital ', u'so  about twelve of them ', u'largely from this michigan area ', u'and they came and stayed for three days ', u'and on the fourth day  they were very upset and they wanted to leave ', u'i was very busy  i couldn t meet them', u'and somebody came and told me ', u' sadhguru  all these doctors are very upset  they want to go ', u'i said   what happened ', u' they are just very upset that there is no yogic hospital here ', u'you told them there is yogic hospital  they think there is no yogic hospital ', u'then i said   okay  let me see them   ', u'then i saw them ', u'they were really upset ', u'they were angry  they were f ', u'they felt cheated that there is no yogic hospital here ', u'where are the patients ', u'where are the uniformed nurses and doctors walking up and down ', u'i said   see ', u'at that time  on that day  maybe there were over seventy patients ', u'but i said   i thought i ll put them to good use', u'and i was making them work in the gardens   ', u'nobody should ever understand sickness is a reward ', u'they must want to get out of it as quickly as possible ', u'right now  we re treating patients in such a way ', u'people would want to be sick', u'whenever they want attention ', u'not just that ', u'one important part of the yogic treatment is ', u'what is called as bhuta shuddhi ', u'this means syncing and purifying the elements within you ', u'water ', u'earth  water  air  fire and space ', u'these five dimensions you can work on ', u'this is the fundamentals of yoga ', u'so one of the most important thing is ', u'i want them barefoot  with open hands  to work in the garden ', u'to just get in touch with the earth ', u'be outside ', u'get in touch with the air  water  earth ', u'half their ailments are gone ', u'treatment is there little bit ', u'rest is all just connection with the world around', u'because this  is a composite of all these things ', u'you remove yourself and keep yourself in a completely alien atmosphere ', u'where you re not in touch ', u'you re four inches above the ground all the time  ', u'you will lose contact with what makes your life ', u'it s the very soil  which you re carrying as your body ', u'is it not important that it needs to be touched', u'with its origins ', u'no  you re looking up ', u'no  your life happens from this planet ', u'there are other dimensions to it  of course ', u'but physical health and the physical nature around you', u'are very closely related ', u'if you don t

unheard of till then ', u'predating all religion ', u'predating all ideologies ', u'for the first time ', u'he brought this possibility into human life that', u'if you are willing to strive ', u'if you are willing to strive ', u'you can cross all the limitations that have been set upon you', u'by your own means or by nature ', u'you can transcend all this if you are willing to strive ', u'he not only said this ', u'he not only opened up this possibility ', u'he expounded the entire science and technologies', u'and various methods and practices', u'through which an individual human being can rise beyond all limitations ', u'the idea of transcendence', u'only happened on this day ', u'the idea of transcendence was first brought into', u'to the human race only on this day ', u'so this day has always been celebrated', u'as one of the most significant days', u'for those who are aspiring to be something more than who they are right now ', u'tell me one person', u'who is not aspiring to be something more than what he or she is right now ', u'it is just that', u'each person is aspiring to be something more', u'within the limitations of what they know ', u'one person s idea of something more may be money ', u'another person s idea of something more may be wealth ', u'another person s idea of something more may be knowledge ', u'love ', u'pleasure ', u'but there is no human being', u'who is not aspiring to be something more than what they are right now ', u'the aspiration is universal ', u'the currency employed for this aspiration may be of various kinds ', u'now the question is  ', u'how many who aspire for this something more ', u'realize that more is not going to fulfill this being  ', u'if you get that something more that you are aspiring for today ', u'tomorrow you will aspire for something more ', u'if that happens  something more', u'because this  is not aspiring for more ', u'this is aspiring for all ', u'so he brought this awareness to start with ', u'with the seven sages who gathered around him ', u'today  they are celebrated in this country as sapta rishis', u'and they in turn brought it to humanity in so many different ways ', u'the significance of the day is that ', u'that it is a shift', u'it is the first full moon day after the shifting of the solstice ', u'this time ', u'certain calendar adjustments have moved it to the second ', u'but normally it is the first full moon day ', u'it is also a time when the sun begins to move southward in relation', u'with this planet on which we are ', u'so  it is also a time ', u'which is a time', u'which is best for receiving grace for variety of reasons ', u'so  this day was one day ', u'which was universally celebrated in this part of the world at one time ', u'this system of celebrating guru poornima', u'and becoming available to grace', u'got dislocated only after the british took over', u'and made sure that you have to go to office on that day  ', u'so  this grand celebration that used to happen across the country', u'in this entire region  not just in india', u'kind of got little dislocated', u'because it is a day when you have to go to work ', u'so things got disturbed ', u'but still ', u'in this country at least ', u'still millions and millions of people are conscious that', u'this is a day of grace ', u'this is a day they can easily become available to grace', u'and hence it s lived on ', u'a time has come in the history of humanity ', u'where our ability to do things in the outside world', u'has almost become superhuman ', u'when i say superhuman ', u'i want you to understand ', u'a thousand years ago or even a hundred years ago ', u'what an individual human being could do', u'and what an individual human being can do today ', u'simply because of the aid of science and technology ', u'is literally superhuman ', u'i am sure a hundred years ago ', u'if you pulled out something from your pocket and spoke to somebody in america right now ', u'people would definitely think you are superhuman or more ', u'believe me ', u'if you had a cellphone hundred years ago ', u'you could have claimed you re god', u'and they would have believed it ', u'you just got your phones too late  ', u'so  once humanity is empowered like this on various levels ', u'it s extremely important that', u'raising of human consciousness becomes of paramount importance ', u'and raising of human consciousness essentially means this ', u'that your longing to expand ', u'wanting to be something more', u'you find a vehicle through which you can expand limitlessly ', u'so  adiyogi on this day transmitted', u'one hundred and twelve ways', u'in which one can expand limitlessly ', u'hundred and twelve ways  ', u'enough variety for you  ', u'if you don t like one  you can pick the other  ', u'one hundred and twelve ways in which you can attain to a limitless expansion ', u'so  here we are on this day', u'and i am supposed to hang out  ', u'when we generally say hangout we mean just ', u'it s a gossipy session ', u'so no problem ', u'because when it comes to inner dimensions ', u'you can only gossip because ', u'you cannot talk about it ', u'you can only talk around it ', u'so  we can only gossip ', u'so  it s appropriate  we just hanging out with you ', u'please', u' the very first question in our google hangout session is', u'from an online participant called cyrus from maryland  usa ', u'and cyrus  question sadhguru is', u'that many people firmly believe that people do not require a guru to become enlightened ', u'rather  they believe that the power to become enlightened lies within us', u'and is within our control ', u'is it realistic to think that we can achieve enlightenment without a guru ', u' in maryland ', u'now ', u'if we have to learn something as simple as abc  alphabets ', u'twenty six only in english language  ', u'samskrit  has fifty four ', u'tamil has two hundred odd ', u'twenty six only ', u'twenty six alphabets ', u'how many of you believe that', u'if you did not have a teacher ', u'you would have learnt these twenty six alphabets ', u'that s the answer   ', u'and especially if you want to walk an uncharted path ', u'new terrain ', u'if you go into new terrain ', u'it is sensible to take instructions  believe me ', u'otherwise ', u'you could try an adventure', u'but even those who adventure ', u'these days use a gps ', u'earlier  they used maps or they listened to the locals ', u'those who do not want to listen to another human being who has already walked the terrain', u'and think they can do it by themselves', u'nothing wrong ', u'i am not saying they cannot  they can  why not ', u'after all  you are only trying to walk the inner territory ', u'it s just that', u'what you could do in a short span of time ', u'you may do it in a million years ', u'if i ask you', u'i think almost all of you are wearing a watch ', u'this is not some rocket science ', u'just a watch ', u'they have been ticking around for hundreds of years now ', u'i will give you all the parts of this watch ', u'dismantle and give it to you ', u'put it together  let me see ', u'no  no ', u'i am not asking you to manufacture a watch ', u'it s all there ', u'we ll dismantle it and give it to you ', u'put it together let me see ', u'we will give you a manual  how to do it ', u'please do it and see  let me see ', u'you will have a watch but you won t tick  ', u'similarly on the spiritual path ', u'without guidance you want to go  ', u'all the best  ', u'no problem ', u'it s just that unnecessary ', u'unnecessary hardship you will create for yourself ', u'if you like it the hard way   fine ', u'what s the problem ', u'some people like suffering ', u'they think nothing good can come out of life unless you suffer ', u'if you are', u'if you are that kind  it s all right ', u'but my intention', u'my intention is people should walk this path blissfully ', u'joyfully  ', u'ecstatic if it s possible  ', u'if you want to go on a tour joyfully ', u'better to go on a guided tour ', u'believe me  ', u'please ', u' our next question is from the international cricketing legend', u'and well loved indian batsman virender sehwag  ', u' oh  he speaks with his bat  ', u'it s a technology issue ', u'it s not him  okay  ', u' i m afraid i will have to read the question while we sort out the audio issue ', u'the question is  ', u'why don t people just share their knowledge sadhguru ', u'why do they withhold it ', u'why don t they share it the way you do ', u' oh ', u'this is the age of intellectual property  ', u'somebody even wants to patent yogasanas ', u'you can patent the asana', u'but still you can t get into it  ', u'you may have patented all the difficult asanas', u'but can you get into it   that s the question ', u'so  we have come to a place in the world ', u'where everything is monetized ', u'everything has a commercial angle to it ', u'so  because of that ', u'as people have been miserly with money ', u'now they are miserly with knowledge ', u'because you know  knowledge is money ', u'so they are miserly with that because it s money in some way ', u'so  this monetizing of everything can really destroy many things in this world ', u'in this culture  we always fixed it like this  ', u'spiritual process ', u'health related things', u'and education ', u'these three things should never be commercialized ', u'everything else can be commercialized ', u'these three things should always be offered  ', u'the question is only about the qualification of the recipient ', u'all kinds of people come and say ', u' i want to go ', u'i want to do this ', u'i want to do that ', u"two days later  they won't be here ", u'so  the question is only about the qualifications of the recipient ', u'if that one thing is ensured ', u'knowledge should be offered', u'irrespective of commercial interests that are involved in it ', u'but today  everything is commercialized', u'and in many ways  you can t help it', u'because the whole momentum is in that direction ', u'virender may be willing to share his knowledge ', u'he may teach ten different people', u'how to hold the bat ', u'how to hit the ball ', u'how to stand ', u'how to do this ', u'how to do that ', u'but how many will go about scoring double centuries after double centuries  ', u'because to get a qualified recipient is not easy ', u'it s not easy ', u'knowledge may be there ', u'when it comes to experiential knowing ', u'how many people are willing to receive it ', u'everybody says   yes ', u'i every day meet people  ', u' all the way  sadhguru  i want to go all the way   ', u'tomorrow morning ', u'they are crying because somebody said something ', u'they want to leave ', u'day after tomorrow morning ', u'their uncle s daughter s birthday they want to go  ', u'i am not saying there s anything wrong with your uncle s daughter  ', u'all i am saying is your interests are many ', u'that means you are not going anywhere ', u'you can dabble with many but there must be one direction to life ', u'otherwise you are not going far ', u'you re going to wander around here ', u'if you want to go  penetrate through something and go a distance ', u'you need some one pointedness ', u'people come here ', u'they say   sadhguru  you give me any kind of sadhana ', u'i am willing to die  sadhguru   ', u'i say   don t die  hold it  ', u'i am willing to offer anything  but hold it ', u'we will see  we will go step by step ', u'three days later  they come and say', u' sadhguru  you know sadhguru  i have', u'i have found somebody sadhguru ', u'i think for lifetimes this person must have been waiting for me ', u'i saw this girl and phoo   ', u'now  now there is a spiritual angle to it ', u' it looks like for lifetimes we have known each other   ', u'if you have known somebody for lifetimes', u'and you didn t make it ', u'it s best you keep away from them ', u'because for most people ', u'their direction of life keeps changing every other day ', u'it s hard to offer anything ', u'it s all bits and pieces ', u'of course  there are also people who think ', u'see knowledge is not something that you own because', u'knowledge is not about you ', u'knowledge is about the creation ', u'about the nature of the creation ', u'what is already there is what you have absorbed ', u'you didn t invent it ', u'you didn t come up with it ', u'you only saw it ', u'this is why the language in this country is very clear ', u'when it comes to any kind of spiritual dimension ', u'we are only talking about realization ', u'realizing means something that was always there ', u'always right here ', u'but you were so stupid you didn t see it ', u'today you saw it ', u'i realized ', u'i did not attain ', u'i did not arise ', u'i did not climb somewhere ', u'i just realized ', u'but the thing was always here ', u'so  what is here all the time as truth', u'cannot belong to somebody ', u'nobody can stop you from it', u'but those who have access  ', u'if they have truly accessed  ', u'they will never block you ', u'they will never hold back ', u'only those who have accumulated from books and stuff ', u'they will hold back', u'because any accumulated stuff is limited', u'and it will get over ', u'if you give away everything  it will get over', u'tomorrow morning  you won t know what to do ', u'so  you will hold it and be miserly because you have gathered it ', u'what is gathered you can hold back ', u'what you have realized you cannot hold back because it s an endless run ', u'you only constantly wishing', u'there is somebody here  who can soak it up as fast as you can give it ', u'that is the problem ', u'the problem is of lack of receptivity  not of holding back   ', u'if you really know ', u'but if you have acquired knowledge', u'you will be miserly', u'because you can only acquire that much ', u'you don t want it  don t want it to get over ', u'knowledge is like money again  ', u'it can get over  ', u' our next question comes from bryn ', u'who is a circus performer and teacher based in france ', u'i m afraid i have to read this question as well', u'while the technical difficulties are being sorted out ', u'bryn s question is  ', u'people living in western societies have many distractions at every corner ', u'how do we maintain a focus in our daily lives', u'to best receive what you have to offer ', u' oh  the distraction is not only in the west  ', u'for those who want to be distracted  there is distractions everywhere ', u'not only in the west ', u'and not just today  even a thousand years ago', u'people were still distracted  believe me ', u'don t think thousand years ago ', u'everybody was focused and fantastic  ', u'no ', u'they were just as good as you or as bad as you  ', u'they were also hanging out in small groups  ', u'now we are hanging out globally  ', u'so  what is that one thing i have to do', u'to be focused or to be able to receive what is offered ', u'very simple  ', u'just remind yourself ', u'tomorrow morning  when you wake up in the morning ', u'just check  ', u'still alive ', u'because every day over a million people die on this planet ', u'you woke up tomorrow morning ', u'over a million people did not wake up tomorrow morning', u'will not wake up tomorrow morning  believe me ', u'you woke up  just check   you re still there  ', u'great  isn t it ', u'you re still alive ', u'can you at least smile ', u' oh i am still alive   great ', u'just check those three four five people who really matter in your life ', u'check if all of them are alive', u'because if one million people die ', u"at least ten million people lost somebody who is dear to them  isn't it ", u'so all those who are  who really matter for you ', u'you are alive  they are alive   fantastic today ', u"it s a great day  isn't it  ", u'don t take this lightly  this s not a joke', u'because ', u'i am reminding you of this', u'because most of you think ', u' other people die  ', u'ah  not me ', u'it s only others who die ', u'no  no  you and me will die ', u' sadhguru  i am asking a spiritual question ', u'you re reminding me of morbid things ', u'  no  nothing morbid about it ', u"death is the one common denominator among all of us  isn't it ", u'yes ', u'one thing common about us ', u'whether you are black  white  blue  yellow ', u'whatever kind you are ', u'man  woman or other six genders  ', u'whatever you may be ', u'one common denominator among all of us is ', u'we will die one day ', u'tch  look at the universality of death  ', u'only when you remind yourself that you are mortal ', u'wanting to know something beyond the physicality of who you are', u'becomes an active process ', u'you will become receptive', u'only when you know the body that you carry ', u'the psychological drama that you are going through ', u'all this is going on ', u'but  one day  pup  it will end ', u'very easily  it will end  believe me ', u'you just have to wait  ', u'see  you don t have to do anything to achieve death ', u'just have to wait ', u'both for yours and others ', u'people come and say ', u' sadhguru this guy  my enemy i can t bear it ', u'i say   just wait  ', u'you don t have to take the trouble  just wait   ', u'one way or the other you will get rid of him ', u'either he will die or you will die laughter applause ', u'so  do this every hour  tch', u'30 ', u'oh  i am still alive  great   ', u'30 ', u'you know how many people died on the planet ', u' but it s not me  right now ', u'now  if you are continuously conscious of your mortal nature ', u'you will become one hundred percent alive', u'to the spiritual dimension of who you are ', u'only because somewhere ', u'it s not that intellectually you do not know ', u'but experientially you are immortal  you know ', u'because when i look at the number of shoes you have bought  ', u'it looks like you are going to live for 10 000 years  ', u'number of clothes and shoes  when i look at them ', u'it looks like lot of people are planning for 1 000  10 000 years of life ', u'no  no  no  it s a brief life ', u'if you know it s a brief life', u'and you are definitely mortal', u'we will try to stretch it with yoga ', u'tch  hmm ', u'we will try to stretch it and make it little longer  but ', u'anyway  you will die ', u'if you are conscious of this every moment of your life', u'initially  because you are in europe ', u'because particularly you are in europe', u'and you have always believed you are immortal  ', u'it may be little struggle in  in the beginning ', u'but still  remind yourself every minute that  i am mortal ', u'i ll die someday and maybe it s today ', u'come to ease with death ', u'then the longing to know what is beyond this physical nature', u'will burst forth within you ', u'once this longing comes ', u'you are one hundred percent receptive to everything that i represent  ', u' the next question comes from divya bharathi ramaswamy ', u'who is doing an ma in computer science in zurich  switzerland ', u' is she talking kind or no   ', u'  namaskaram sadhguru  my question is  ', u'would marriage be only a hindrance if someone  spiritually     especially women ', u'and also  for someone who has gone through    yourself ', u'what would you say  from your experience  ', u' something about would marriage be a hindrance  something  okay', u' ', u'is marriage a hindrance for one s spiritual journey ', u'see  marriage is not a commodity that you carry on your head ', u'but many people carry it on their head ', u'it s just an arrangement ', u'so that socially  there is some sense to the way', u'you fulfill the needs that you have ', u'a human being has needs  ', u'physical ', u'psychological ', u'emotional ', u'financial ', u'social ', u'various kinds of needs ', u'to fulfill these things in a dignified manner ', u'we came up with something called marriage ', u'so that it is fulfilled within a framework ', u'your desires don t run wild', u'and disturb everything in the society ', u'some kind of a framework', u'so that it can be conducted in a sensible manner ', u'now you have raised this to heaven', u'because somebody told you ', u' marriages are made in heaven   ', u'only the unmarried ones think so  ', u'so it s just two people  all right ', u'now  spiritual process is about turning inward ', u'can i turn inward with somebody else  ', u'marriage is an arrangement to fulfill certain aspect of your life ', u'don t complicate life by thinking ', u' we will walk together on the spiritual path ', u'there is no such thing', u'because spiritual path is not ', u'not the path that you take into the velliangiri mountains ', u'that you want to walk together ', u'even if you go to velliangiri mountains ', u'please don t walk hand in hand  ', u'it s a narrow pathway', u'and it s not an appropriate way to walk in the forest  ', u'you can walk in the park hand in hand ', u'you can go shopping hand in hand ', u'you can sit in a cinema hand in hand ', u'you can t turn inward hand in hand  ', u'now  does it mean to say someone who is married ', u'what it', u'let s understand this ', u'someone who is married means', u'someone who s made an official arrangement for their needs in life ', u'a formal arrangement for simple needs that a human being has ', u'which are biological ', u'which are psychological ', u'which are social  many things ', u'so  these arrangements that you have made ', u'conduct these arrangements gracefully ', u'so there will be time and space for you to turn around ', u'if you pay excess attention to these arrangements ', u'then turning around will not be possible ', u'this does not mean if you are alone  you will do it ', u'if you are alone  you may be always looking out  ', u'you will spend your entire time and life looking out for somebody ', u'that will also not help ', u'if you think your desires ', u'your longings', u'and your needs', u'can be well handled by an arrangement of marriage  ', u'all right ', u'don t try to raise it to heaven ', u'it doesn t happen in heaven  believe me ', u'and if heaven is making so many mistakes  ', u'then we will have to seriously reconsider many things  ', u'so  of course in india ', u'we don t blame it on the heaven ', u'we do our own calculations ', u'of all the arrangements of stars and planets and everything ', u'we match all the planets and stars very well ', u'it s very easy to match stars because', u'they never fought ever  ', u'but to match these two people  ', u'that nobody has managed ', u'except those two people if they are sensible  ', u'if they are sensible  they can manage it ', u'nobody else can match these two people  ', u'priests have tried ', u'gods have tried ', u'ghosts and goblins have tried ', u'it s not worked and not worked and not worked ', u'two sensible people  they can manage ', u'if both of them understand the limitations of the arrangement', u'and the possibilities of the arrangement ', u'they can conduct it sensibly ', u'if you try to raise it to heaven ', u'you will see it will for sure crash ', u'so  your marriage has nothing to do with your spiritual process', u'because your spiritual process is an inward journey ', u'but one dimension of this is  ', u'to walk alone  people falter ', u'actually  this question was asked to gautama the buddha ', u' is it better to walk alone or in company ', u'gautama looked and said ', u' it s better to walk alone than to walk with a fool   ', u'because gautama   not me  okay   ', u'gautama believes only a fool will marry you  ', u'it s him ', u'not me  okay  ', u'please ', u' this is a question that comes from stephanie in malaysia ', u' namaskaram sadhguru ', u' namaskaram  the first one who is speaking clearly  ', u' having been to various international forums and met many great leaders ', u'where do you see the world heading ', u'for the better or worse ', u' oh   let me correct that question a bit ', u'yes  i ve been in international forums  met many leaders ', u'you added  great  leaders  ', u'so  many leaders   not always so great ', u'yes  there are a few great leaders  no question about that ', u'where is the world heading  ', u'there are many possibilities', u'because we have capabilities and technologies ', u'which no other generation could ever dream of ', u'will our capabilities turn against us', u'or will they work for us is the big question ', u'if all the human capabilities ', u'which are so hugely enhanced', u'because of technology', u'everything that an individual human being could do', u'has expanded manifold ', u'in this enhanced state', u'and our numbers have increased tremendously ', u'in the beginning of twentieth century ', u'we were just about 1 5 billion people ', u'today we are 7 3 billion people ', u'the united nations making predictions that by 2050 ', u'we will be 9 7 billion people ', u'if all these people get educated  get technologically empowered ', u'9 7 billion people or nearly 10 billion people on this planet', u'is for sure going to be a disaster ', u'yes ', u'we can make arrangements and arrangements ', u'we can improve the arrangements ', u'we can make more energy saving machines ', u'we can recycle the shit  ', u'yes  ', u'we can do all this', u'but if we don t come to our senses with human populations ', u'there s going to be', u'i want you to just imagine ', u'how the world will be', u'if the population almost goes up by fifty percent tomorrow ', u'just imagine your town  how it will be', u'if fifty percent population increases tomorrow morning ', u'or in other words ', u'no matter what we create ', u'no matter how much we strive ', u'whether', u'whatever we build ', u'everything is going to be insufficient', u'because the planet is going to be insufficient ', u'of course  we are looking at planets', u'which could sustain life outside of this solar system ', u'we ve found two three very promising planets ', u'it s just a little  you know  not in the walking distance   ', u'a few ', u'few thousand or a million light years away ', u'great planets  i believe ', u'but this is the thing ', u'but nobody wants to address this issue ', u'everybody wants to talk about cosmetic solutions ', u'not address the basic problem of expanding human population ', u'i was in a conference and i said ', u' see  unless you ', u'unless you reduce the human footprint on the planet ', u'there is no solution for anything ', u'then they asked me a brilliant question ', u' how do you reduce the human footprint ', u'i said   you have to reduce the number of feet  ', u'that s the only way   ', u'so  right now ', u'it doesn t matter what others think ', u'all of you who are here', u'and those of you who re hanging out with me ', u'we can take it upon ourselves', u'that we will not push the human population ', u'you can have a dog  ', u'she is there   ', u'a husband and wife were having a debate  ', u'whether to have a child or not ', u'the husband wanted a child ', u'the wife hesitating because', u'she will lose the shape of her body and you know ', u'for a husband ', u'having a baby is simple  ', u'but for the woman ', u'it s too many things involved ', u'so  debate was going on', u'and then they came and the debate moved into an area where ', u' should we have a baby or should we get a dog   ', u'then they could not decide ', u'they went to a counselor ', u'they put their problem in front of him ', u'so  he said ', u' you got to just make up your mind ', u'whether you want to ruin the carpets or your life   ', u'i am not saying children are bad  they are wonderful ', u'but it s just too many ', u'we as human beings ', u'we are wonderful but we are too many ', u'we re so many that the insect population is going down  ', u'no  no  it s not a joke  it s very  it s very threatening ', u'if the insect population disappears  the planet will be destroyed ', u'yes ', u'the worms disappear ', u'the planet will be destroyed ', u'if you and me disappear  planet will flourish  ', u'so  leave the leaders alone', u'because in every conference that you meet ', u'very cosmetic solutions are being talked about  ', u'how to adjust the market place  okay  ', u'how to do this  how to do that ', u'i  on immediate scale  yes ', u'those things are necessary ', u'but you are talking about what is the future of this world ', u'if that is so ', u'if we want a future for this world ', u'if we want our children and their children to live well on this planet ', u'the only way is to bring down human population  ', u'not by doing some horrible acts ', u'but if we have', u'see  our life expectancy has improved ', u'this means we have taken death into our hands ', u'when we take death into our hands ', u"it is our business to take birth also into our hands  isn't it  ", u'if we convince the population of this one thing ', u'future is very bright ', u'because tomorrow morning the sun will come up ', u'what s the problem  ', u'please', u' the next question comes from sahil gurung from the united kingdom ', u' namaskaram sadhguruji ', u' namaskaram ', u' sadhguruji  my question is  ', u'is enlightenment a gradual process', u'or it happens when our body  mind and energies comes to a point', u'where it is perfectly satisfied ', u'like making a quantum leap ', u'thank you ', u' are you asking how it happens in uk or in india  ', u'  on planet earth ', u'  so the question is  ', u'is enlightenment a gradual process', u'or when your body  mind  energies align ', u'is it like a quantum leap ', u'is it something that bursts out ', u' yes  ', u' see  the mango season is just getting over ', u'you don t know what it is ', u'sahil  you are in uk ', u'mango season is getting over ', u'in india  it s a big thing ', u'if you looked at the mango tree in the month of october  november  december ', u'you didn t see any sweetness dripping out of it ', u'suddenly in january  february  flowers came ', u'they were not as attractive as jasmine or rose flowers or something ', u'some tiny little flowers came ', u'suppose you do not know this is a mango tree', u'and you tested it ', u'you take a leaf and bite it  it was quite bitter ', u'but suddenly in the month of april  may ', u'huge drops of sweetness ', u'hanging there in the tree  tch', u'sahil  you have not eaten the mango this season  ', u' i got it from the supermarket  that s all  ', u' eh  you are  you are eating mangoes from nigeria  ', u'so  if you did not have prior', u'prior knowledge that this is a mango tree ', u'did you think', u'this tree is actually manufacturing this sweetness ', u'but you think suddenly in april  sweetness came ', u'it has been slowly manufacturing this sweetness', u'and it put it out at a certain season ', u"but it s been on  right through the year  isn't it ", u'mangoes happen only in one season ', u'you notice the sweetness only at a certain time ', u'this does not mean', u'the mango tree was not striving and working to produce that sweetness ', u'you cut any part of the mango tree and taste it  ', u'tch  you will not find  a slightest tinge of sweetness ', u'believe me ', u'but when the mango comes ', u'how much sweetness ', u'where is it coming from ', u'it s been working on it ', u'you couldn t see it ', u'similarly  is it a process ', u'for sure  it is a process ', u'but can everybody see the process ', u'identify the process ', u'no ', u'when somebody is evolving on the spiritual path ', u'others thought he is a nutcase ', u'somebody thought he s vagrant ', u'somebody thought he is a vagabond ', u'somebody thought he is something else ', u'but when the sweetness came ', u'everybody who tasted realized that', u'this is a fantastic thing  ', u'so  nothing in the universe happens bang  bang  bang ', u'everything is a process ', u'can you identify the process ', u'can you recognize the process is the question ', u'generally  anybody who carries', u'generally among human beings ', u'when they are children ', u'any child which carries a certain level of genius within him ', u'which is irrepressible', u'everybody has genius within them but they are repressible ', u'systems in the society ', u'their own fears ', u'their own anxieties ', u'their own need for security represses their genius ', u'every human being has some kind of genius', u'but over ninety percent of the human beings', u'never find expression to it because', u'they give in to other things ', u'things become  other things become more important ', u'when you were twelve  fifteen you thought ', u' i ll do this ', u'i ll do that ', u'i ll go to the moon ', u'but you saw the neighborhood girl ', u'and started calling her the moon  ', u'moon disappeared  ', u'hey  ', u'so  like this ', u'in everybody the possibility is wide open ', u'the thing is', u'can you sustain the process', u'and allow it to become that possibility ', u'between possibility and reality  there is a distance ', u'most people neither have the courage nor the conviction', u'to walk that distance ', u'largely  spiritual process is a kind of an entertainment ', u'go to discourse after discourse  discourse after discourse ', u'read more and more books', u'and debate how your atman  paramatman  your soul is floating here  there', u'and about heaven and hell and everything', u'but do nothing about this   ', u"so  it's largely ", u'it s largely like entertainment ', u'so  there is a process for sure ', u'the process can be approached consciously', u'or it may be an unconscious process', u'but you re doing the right things ', u'this is the beauty of this universe  ', u'whether you know or you do not know ', u'knowingly or unknowingly ', u'with discipline or with indiscipline ', u'with love or with hate ', u'if you do the right things ', u'right things will happen to you ', u'that is the beauty of this universe  ', u'so shankara  adi shankara said ', u' yogarathova bhogarathova ', u'somehow  either through yoga or bhoga ', u'somehow do it ', u'somehow find the truth of your inner nature', u'because what we are considering as truth is simply this  ', u"whatever works on all levels of life must be the truth  isn't it ", u'hmm ', u'whatever really works on all levels of life must be the truth ', u'whatever you know in your life  test it right now  because', u'you have a mind which can project ', u'right now  you are striving for a certain level of income', u'or a certain kind of house', u'or a car', u'or something else or something else ', u'put yourself in different stages of life and see', u'if it still means a lot to you ', u'see  suppose', u'not tomorrow ', u'let s say hundred years later ', u'you are on your deathbed ', u'just see if your jewelry  your make up  your car will mean something to you on that day ', u'this does not mean you must give it up today ', u'it is just that you must keep it in its place ', u'you must not carry it in your heart   ', u'there is a difference', u'between using something and being used by something ', u'most people', u'most people do not know how to use the things that they buy ', u'the things that they buy are using them up ', u'they are enslaving the human being ', u'whatever things you want to use  you can use  that s not an issue ', u'but the problem is', u'you let those things use you ', u'this is not okay ', u'so if you just take care that', u'you are not used by anything ', u'you understand the limited role that everything has in your life  ', u'the limited role of your education ', u'the limited role of your career ', u'the limited role of your marriage ', u'the limited role of your relationships ', u'the limited role of your wealth ', u'the limited role of everything that you are doing  ', u'if you understand', u'where one thing begins and where it ends ', u'then you don t have to do anything ', u'spiritual process is on  ', u'when the season is right ', u'the flowers will bloom and mangoes will come   ', u' the next question  comes from a prominent figure in indian public life ', u'this is the honorable minister of state for culture ', u'tourism and civil aviation  dr  mahesh sharma ', u' thank you sadhguruji ', u'you gave me opportunity to mark this celebration of guru poornima utsav', u'with this much big presence over here ', u'but a big question comes to my mind that we keep ', u'and especially the indians keep after the god and parents ', u'guru at the highest esteem ', u'but we have not been able to make guru poornima celebration utsav in the same spirit of high spirit', u'as we respect the gurus ', u' i kind of addressed this already in the beginning but anyway ', u'the reason why', u'guru poornima and so many other things ', u'which were of great spiritual importance in this country ', u'have slid back into the background of our lives is  ', u'because we have been an occupied nation for a period of time', u'and whatever the framework that the occupying forces set for us ', u'when we got our independence ', u'we should have looked at', u'what kind of framework we want for our nation ', u'we did not do that ', u'we just allowed the same framework to continue ', u'for example ', u'in this country ', u'right from ancient times ', u'even for a farmer who ploughs the land ', u'even today many farmers', u'don t set their plough on their land on monday mornings ', u'yes ', u'in tamil nadu  it s still true ', u'in the north  it s been given up', u'because no', u'no animals being used  all tractors ', u'you have to', u'you have taken a bank loan ', u'the interest is ticking ', u'so you want it to run all the seven days  ', u'all these things ', u'when the british came ', u'they changed these things', u'because they  they knew the strength of this nation was essentially in the culture ', u'so they wanted to break the culture ', u'very systematically  they engineered', u'how to break the culture ', u'they made you sunday holiday ', u'what are you going to do on sunday ', u'watch television and eat potato chips  ', u'what are you going to do on sunday ', u'they had an intention for a sunday morning ', u'what is the intention for the majority of the population in this country on sunday morning ', u'there is nothing for us to do on sunday morning ', u'monday morning  there re lots of things happening ', u'but you have to go to office ', u'for a long time in this country ', u'the monthly holidays were like this  ', u'pournami means', u'every pournami means three days holiday  ', u'one day before  the day and the next day ', u'amavasya means two days holiday  ', u'these', u'these two days of full moon day and new moon day', u'have something to do with our system  ', u'something to do with the planet ', u'something to do with the very way we re born ', u'we are physically here today', u'only because our mothers  bodies were in sync with the cycles of the moon ', u'otherwise we won t be here ', u'so  there are things which are happening in your system ', u'as you know  the very oceans are rising on these days ', u'when such a massive body of water is rising up ', u'this body ', u'which is over seventy percent water ', u'you think nothing is rising in this  ', u'that  the  those days were kept as spiritually significant days ', u'those are not the days to go to work ', u'those are the days to focus upon yourself ', u'so  similarly the guru poornima used to be a huge festival across the', u'this whole region ', u'but it s gone because people have to go to work ', u'so  i request you ', u'being', u'you being a minister in the union cabinet ', u'this is something that you must do  ', u'that', u'i know for you to pitch for every pournima', u'pournami being a holiday is not going to be practical ', u'but at least guru poornima  ', u'if you', u'from the federal government ', u'from the central government ', u'if you declare guru poornima as a holiday ', u'i will make sure guru poornima is celebrated across this country ', u'with great fervor ', u'because', u'because the spirit is still alive ', u'there is no space for expression ', u'there is no space or time for expression ', u'please  if you can do this one thing ', u'and we can make guru poornima a big tourism attraction for this country ', u'as', u'as i have already spoken to you', u'about making', u'india the spiritual gateway ', u'guru poornima can be the day', u'which really draws spiritual tourists from across the world to this country ', u'so  even as a part of your job  ', u'it s a good thing to do   ', u' sadhguru  the next question comes from heena parekh ', u'a twenty year old student from northampton in the united kingdom ', u' sadhguru  what is the significance of initiation ', u' okay ', u'what is the significance of initiation ', u'initiation is not about a bundle of instructions ', u'in fact  in any initiation process ', u'instructions are a kind of disturbance ', u'it s a nuisance ', u'i am saying it s a nuisance because', u'we are still giving instructions', u'because most people', u'because today they have all become educated ', u'everything has to be told  you know ', u'or it must be printed  these days ', u'if you tell them also it s not enough ', u'they wanted a printed sheet ', u'the instructions of the initiation', u'because they are all educated ', u'their brains are full of words ', u'not of life ', u'too many words ', u'so everything has to be verbal ', u'even saying it is not good enough ', u'you have to print it', u'or you have to record it and give it to them', u'so that they can put headphones', u'and listen to the instructions every time ', u'initiation is not a bundle of words ', u'if we have to use an analogy ', u'if you know something about electricity  ', u'in electrical imple  you know  motors and stuff ', u'there is something called as induction ', u'the power is there ', u'the motor is there ', u'everything is there ', u'but without an induction switch it will not go ', u'all the ingredients are there', u'but still it will not happen', u'because there s no induction of energy ', u'so initiation is like an induction ', u'you have all the ingredients to be meditative', u'but it doesn t happen  ', u'why does it not happen ', u'because this is the way the creation itself happened ', u'if you go by the traditional explanation  ', u'one way ', u'if you go by the modern scientific way  ', u'it s the same thing said in a different language ', u'modern science is talking about', u'how everything was empty space ', u'now they are removing the word empty and saying it was space ', u'there is no physicality there', u'but there seems to be something else there ', u'what that something else  we don t know ', u'as per the science ', u'and today they ve made experiments', u'where in vacuum state ', u'if you apply a certain energy around it  ', u'not into it ', u'around it  ', u'suddenly virtual protons and virtual neutrons will spill out ', u'that means creation begins', u'just because there s energy playing around ', u'there is a beautiful story in the yogic tradition ', u'shiva', u'you must understand the word shiva ', u'shiva means  shi va means that which is not ', u'appropriate description for space ', u'that which is  is physical creation ', u'that which is not ', u'is non physical dimension of the existence ', u'so shiva means that which is not ', u'shiva was lying ', u'his body spread across the cosmos ', u'but he is not ', u'he doesn t exist ', u'he doesn t have a physical manifestation ', u'then shakti  a certain dimension of energy ', u'came and danced around him', u'and then he came alive ', u'then he started spitting galaxies out of his mouth ', u'this is the most  appropriate description', u'of how creation happened ', u'still spitting galaxies ', u'new galaxies ', u'it s continuously happening ', u'simply because a certain energy touched it ', u'everything that was needed for creation was already there in him', u'but he needed induction ', u'so  initiation is a kind of an induction process ', u'but unfortunately today ', u'if i just ask people to just sit here ', u'we ll do things for you ', u'they ll     ', u' nothing happening ', u'why is he not doing anything   ', u'you are supposed to say something ', u'so what to do ', u'for modern times  we say a lot of things ', u'we hang out with you  ', u'today if you go and sit in the dhyanalinga temple ', u'without instruction you can become meditative ', u'i can do that to you here now ', u"what's her name ", u'heena ', u'heena  you are in uk ', u'if you re willing to just sit there ', u'i can do it to you now  wherever you are ', u'but right now  you got too', u'you are a student  still educating  ', u'maybe you are a possibility  not fully educated  ', u'too many words in your head ', u'the only thing you understand is words ', u'because of that  instructions have come ', u'otherwise  initiation is not about instruction ', u'there really no instruction in it ', u'initiation is just an induction process ', u'it s an energy process ', u'but we have to talk about energy  tch  you know ', u'we have to talk a lot about energy', u'before they open their mouth and ', u' ohh  appadiya   ', u'tough times for gurus  ', u'too much talking  ', u'if you don t talk  nobody will be here ', u'very few can really understand  ', u'if we simply sit here and reverberate ', u'they will also sit here and reverberate ', u'those numbers are small ', u'well  in isha  those numbers are increasing ', u'i don t have to say much  ', u'but in the larger world  you have to  tch ', u'you have to talk  talk  talk and talk ', u'hang out with people   ', u'global gossip ', u' our next online participant is manj musik ', u'a well known punjabi hip hop singer ', u' ohh ', u' and he prefers to call his input an offering  rather than a question ', u' hope the audio works  ', u' the next question comes from sameer oberoi ', u'an advertising professional in gurgaon ', u'and his question  sadhguru  is  ', u'i hope to visit the ashram for mahashivarathri next year', u'because i have been inspired by your description of shiva', u'as the ultimate outlaw ', u'can you tell us something more about this fascinating figure ', u'  shiva being the ultimate outlaw  ', u'you must understand what is outlaw ', u'many of you have suffered the in laws  ', u'i hope you won t meet too many outlaws ', u'but when we say the ultimate outlaw ', u'you must understand all laws  ', u'all laws  ', u'are of some meaning only in the physical sphere of life ', u'see suppose you did not have a body  ', u'i want you to just imagine yourself ', u'you don t have a body  ', u'what law do you have to follow  ', u'you can go wherever you want ', u'you can do whatever you want ', u'yes ', u'only because you have a body  ', u'where to go ', u'where not to go ', u'what to do  what not to do ', u'only in the physical realm  the laws have a meaning ', u'one who has transcended the physical ', u'he has no laws ', u'so he is a outlaw ', u'he is out of all laws ', u'this is what spiritual process means  ', u'within yourself  you are out of all laws', u'because once you transcend your physical nature ', u'none of the laws bind you ', u'in the society   yes ', u'but within yourself  ', u'no ', u'because you are an outlaw because', u'you are out of the physical nature ', u'so in that context ', u'he is the ultimate outlaw', u'and mahashivarathri is his day ', u'the significance of the day is that on that day ', u'there is a phenomenal upsurge of energy within the human system ', u'this is why on that night ', u'you are not supposed to sleep ', u'you must keep your spine vertical', u'so that you make use of this natural upsurge within you ', u'so on that night  there is a huge festival here ', u'this year  this is going to be a mega festival because', u'we have crossed the twenty one year cycle ', u'this is a new cycle ', u'and it is going to be a phenomenal event ', u'you must  you are in gurgaon  not too far away ', u'you must be here on that day  it s an incredible night', u'and we will have many things happening on that night ', u'we are  already our teams are working to make this into a major possibility for every human being', u'and we will also make it happen across the country', u'and in many parts of the world in various cities ', u'having video feeds and stuff ', u'though there is a time difference in the other countries ', u'and as a precursor to this in a way', u'not really a precursor but this is a special event which happens only once  ', u'only once ', u'that is we don t repeat this ', u'this will happen in december ', u'till now  we have done three special events like this ', u'where they are production quality ', u'entire ashram is done up for this purpose ', u'not like other programs  which are repeated ', u'this is only onetime programs ', u'we did vaibhav shiva ', u'which was about how shiva taught yoga ', u'then we did three years later ', u'leela  ', u'this is about how krishna taught yoga ', u'then about three years ago ', u'we did mahabharat ', u'which is the grandest story that you can imagine ', u'it s a story inside a story inside a story ', u'it s the most phenomenal story ', u'it s the longest story on the planet ', u'so  an eight day event happened like this ', u'hundreds of hours of videos ', u'they are still editing ', u'not released after three years  ', u'so this year ', u'in the month of december  between twenty second and twenty sixth ', u'we will have an event ', u'which is about the devotees of shiva  ', u'we have not', u'there are different types of cultures ', u'which have evolved out of devotion for shiva ', u'they are in different geographical locations in the country  largely ', u'and they have their own practices ', u'they have their own traditions ', u'cultures ', u'their own flavor ', u'their own poetry ', u'their own music ', u'so  this will be a', u'an exquisite event of music  art  poetry', u'and of course the spiritual fundamental ', u'so this will be about the devotees of shiva ', u'this will be a limited number of people ', u'we can t have a crowd like this  ', u'but others can hang out later  ', u'okay ', u'we will make it available to you in some way ', u'so this will be a four  five day event in the month of december ', u'starting on the winter solstice ', u'which is twenty second of december', u'twenty first of december ', u'it s an event to look forward to', u'because it s an onetime event ', u'we will not repeat those events again ', u'those of you who can afford to be there in terms of time and whatever else ', u'please make sure you are there ', u'i am excited ', u' and the last question of this evening s sathsang', u'comes from carmen dragomir ', u'a journalist and writer from romania ', u' she s not a gymnast   ', u'

u'in some way  ', u'if you want to really make a gift  ', u'in some way you offer something that is you ', u'not some material that you can get rid of ', u'give away the nastiest part of you today  to me  okay ', u'i am not asking for the beautiful things that are there in you ', u'i am not even asking for your love ', u'i am asking ', u'whatever is the nastiest part of you  ', u'your prejudice ',

 please take   ', u'something that s a part of you ', u'if you think you want to give something ', u'because i am telling you ', u'because many questions were asked in this direction ', u'the greatest thing or the most important thing that needs to happen on this planet is', u'an inward movement within human beings ', u'this hugely empowered humanity ', u'without the necessary inner balance  is a potential danger to everybody ', u'to everything ', u'to every other life ', u'to every other creature  we are a danger ', u'so  more and more people should commit themselves', u'to turn the world inward ', u'if you are already deeply entangled in life ', u'at least send your children in that direction ', u'something that is very precious to you ', u"that s what you must give  isn't it ", u'if you want to give ', u'send your children in that direction ', u'that they will strive to turn the world inward', u'because this is the most important thing that needs to happen', u'if human beings and

welcome', u'you are most welcome ', u'if you want to give something beautiful ', u'you must give yourself  your time  your life ', u'if that s not possible ', u'anyway the future generation ', u'at

ref = [u'you', u'danone so good  huh murder no', u'milana mother', u'murder none karuna', u'lever shoddy', u'circle um karuna', u'samaya dipper and aquila', u'good afternoon everybody the excellencies and ladies and gentlemen thank you for being good', u'afternoon sorrow and good afternoon to your excellencies and distinguished guests and', u'to all the meditators who are watching on the internet right now ', u"i'm so grateful to be here and and it's such a privilege really to be here  my name is maxwell kennedy and", u"i've been i learned how to meditate from sadhguru a few years ago  so we're here at the united nations and", u'their forts maybe 40 or 60 ambassadors here in 70 different countries and', u"7 000 people and we're here to talk about sustainable development", u'so why did you start with a chant ', u'the chant is an invocation an invocation means', u'to perform different types of activities', u'we need to have our energies in different ways', u'otherwise', u'most people have become competent in one way or the other but if you ask them to do something totally different', u'they will find themselves totally at loss', u'this is simply because their energies get', u'directed in one way only an invocation means', u'you kind of make yourself malleable in such a way that for every different type of action you need your energies in different', u'parts of your system  and you are able to graduate that', u'calibrate that in such a way to perform that specific activity', u'so when i sit here what we need to do is different from what i was doing when i was walking down here', u"so this is just calibration using sounds if we have to know the meaning it's", u'talking about how birth is sweetness  but death is compassion so relief', u'we may think that is a terrible thing but', u"aren't we glad that some day  we will die suppose  we could not die that would be terrible isn't it ", u"suppose we can't die at all and", u'above all it is talking about yoga in the sense', u'the chant is describing yoga as a way of transcending time when we said transcending time', u'right now we have a sense of time only because we are so identified with our physical nature', u'suppose we did not have a body we would would not have any sense of time our bodies keeping time', u'everything that is time is cyclical', u'but yoga is a dimension which wants to transcend which helps you to transcend these cycles and make a journey beyond', u'cyclically nature of life  which is the nature of physical existence ', u'thank you um i', u'had a teacher at harvard who was a medical doctor', u'and he told me a story that when he was a young doctor he went down to mississippi', u'and he saw children there in the united states as in the', u'mid 1960s who were starving and', u'after that trip he went to washington dc and', u'he had he tried to meet a group of senators', u'and he went to one after the other and none of them would talk to him and', u"on sunday afternoon  he got my father's phone number at home", u"my father is senator robert f kennedy and my sister carrie who runs the robert f kennedy memorial he's here right now in my wife", u"vicki so but he got my dad's number and he called and", u"and it was sunday my dad's with the children and and and he said to him are well alright", u"why don't you come over and we'll talk and", u'after they spoke my dad went to mississippi', u'to where this doctor had gone  and when he came back', u'he wrote this  he said these words and there are others on', u'the backroads of mississippi where thousands of children slowly starved their lives away', u'their minds damaged beyond repair by the age of four or five in the camps of the migrant workers a', u"half million nomads virtually unprotected by collective bargaining or social security minimum wage or workman's compensation", u"exposed to the capra's of fate and the crew of their fellow  man alike and", u"on indian reservations where the unemployment rate is 80  and where suicide is not a philosopher's question", u'but the leading cause of death among young people', u'so after that trip my father went back to the senate', u'and he worked with a group of others and they created the first food stamps program in the united states', u"and that is kind of the development model that i'm used to so when i look at the", u'sustainable development goals of the united nations my immediate reaction is to think are the addis ababa', u'accords going to fund this or not', u'but you have a different approach  can you talk about yoga in that context ', u'so when we say sustainable', u'development goals  we are talking about ', u'human wellbeing', u'addressing human wellbeing as', u'17 different issues which concerns poverty', u"nourishment health women's issues environment this kind of things", u"essentially  we're talking about him and well being", u'how can you transform the world without transforming individual human beings ', u"this is the effort that's going on in the world for a long time  we want to transform the world", u'but we are not aiming at individual human beings', u'the world is just a word', u'it is just you and me if there is no transformation in you and me if there is no change in the way we perceive', u'experience  and we think feel and act in this world  how can you change the world ', u'so we can pump in money  we can have projects', u'they will all go up and go down', u'but only if we transform individual human beings on a large scale only then there will be true transformation', u'this is why yoga becomes a significant thing today ', u'the united nations taking this taking up this international yoga day is a very important step', u"i would say it's a revolutionary approach", u'because without', u'transforming individual human beings you cannot really transform the world because there is no such thing as', u'in reality in reality', u"there's just you me and someone else if all of us change the world has changed if we refuse to change", u'we will be only talking about it', u"i've been to any number of international peace conferences and everybody is talking about world peace in one of these", u'conferences where there were 17', u'nobel laureates  i asked him a simple question', u'is it is it true that all of you are ', u'truly peaceful human beings can you put your hand on your heart and say i am peaceful ', u"they admitted no sadhguru  we don't know how to be peaceful  but we want the world peaceful  how is it possible ", u'what what you see is the world is just a larger manifestation of who we are ', u'sadhguru you can see all around the world in brazil in the united states in la where i live people are doing yoga and', u"when we're doing it  we're i'm stretching out my body and", u'trying to control my breathing', u'can can you explain what yoga really is and how that can help ', u'attain the sdgs', u'so this fundamental human longing', u'for health for', u'wellbeing for', u'fulfillment of life', u'when you find a', u'logically correct and scientifically ascertainable way  then we say this is yoga', u'yoga means', u"in search in pursuit of human wellbeing we've been doing all kinds of things we've been looking up for a long time", u'which has led to', u'humanity being divided in the name of', u'religion scarce creeds in so many different ways', u'now in the last 50 years i would say we are looking out seriously and', u'we are ripping the planet apart', u'all the environmental degradation that we are talking about is just in pursuit of human wellbeing', u'in the last hundred years', u'definitely  we are the most comfortable generation ever', u'but we cannot say we are well', u'because we hit not really well people are not happy people are not peaceful', u'that is not happening because we have not at rest in nature  so when it when you address it in a scientific manner', u'rather than by belief by philosophy by', u'ideologies you address human well being in a scientific way  this is yoga', u"the word yoga literally means union when we say union what we're talking about is we are talking about a", u'scientific way of obliterating your the boundaries of your individuality', u'when i say a scientific way of obliterating the boundaries of your individual nature what this means is', u'right now as we sit here  this is me that is you distinctly clear  but we are breathing the same air', u'we are we are a product of the same earth', u'what you call as myself is just a pop up on this planet and it will pop out', u"but in this little bit of time  we have divided this in such a way that we can't meet", u'yoga means you obliterate', u'this individual boundaries not intellectually not by belief not by ideology  but as a living experience', u'will be launched  i mean this was there in the video  we launched a very large scale', u'environmental project in southern india', u'the fundamental for this came from this', u'this happened to me when i was in the university and', u'recently about eight years ago when i when i happened to be in my hometown and', u'after a very long time one of my english teachers came up to me and said now', u"i understand why you would not let me teach robert frost i said ma'am", u'why would i not let you teach robert frost i like robert frost', u"she said don't you remember you didn't let me teach frost then i remembered", u'she came one day till then we were reading only english poets', u'she came and introduced the american poet and she said robert frost is a great man  and then she started off woods are lovely dark', u'and deep i said stop i', u"said a man who calls a tree a wood i don't want to listen to this guy", u'she', u"she said no  no this is a very great point  i said i don't care how great  he is he calls tree a wood i", u"don't want to listen to him", u'then when we wanted to start this', u'process in southern india when we found that rivers were going dry and the groundwater was sinking very rapidly', u'when i decided we will plant 114 million trees in tamil  nadu', u'the simple thing that we did was i took thousands of people made them sit in the trees', u'and we set up a yogic process with which they experienced that what they are breathing out', u"the trees are inhaling what the trees are exhaling they're inhaling and they realized one half of the lungs is hanging out there", u'once they realize this there is no stopping', u'even today millions of trees are being planted on a yearly basis all done by common people', u'simply because we brought this yogic experience to them that they truly', u'realized that one half of their breathing apparatus is actually out there not here', u'so bringing this experience into people that what you think as myself is not', u'within the boundaries of your physical nature it goes well beyond that if this becomes a living reality', u'then fulfilling these goals that united nations has for the world is', u'becomes much more possible than the way it is right now where we are trying to push in one way', u"but a whole lot of people are pushing in the opposite direction because they don't even see it as  ", u'thank you  sir  guru i wanted to', u'point out this incredible thing about the tree planting project is that sud guru ', u'insisted that the trees be planted on small plots of land less than half an acre and', u'half of the trees are fruit trees', u'and then half of them can be used for firewood so that the people who live on these lands are', u'benefited from them they take care of the trees and those trees actually really grow and', u"one of the things that that's really working on is is poverty and", u'when i look at the world today  and i see', u'especially in the united states this', u"incredible gap between people who have capital and people who don't and", u"i it's a it's a very disturbing sign to me that this the gap between rich and poor", u'can you talk a little bit about how yoga would address that in terms of sustainable development ', u'civilians to understand this that we have chosen it cannot an economic model  which is all about everybody for himself or herself', u'there is no larger commitment to humanity as such because that is market economy', u'everybody does according to their own', u"capabilities and skills and grab what they can grab it's literally", u'shootings good economy  but we have gone for this simply because', u'the', u'socialistic communistic', u"ideas have unfortunately failed not necessarily because they're bad because human beings are not ready for it yet", u'that is', u'poor people who had nothing wanted to share the rich never wanted to share', u'so it became a joke in the world if the rich had to if rich had the consciousness to share', u'communism would have been a great idea', u"but the poor want to share rich don't want to share so that is the same situation here", u'and this is the same situation building up everywhere else in the world', u'this is the best way to run the world no  but do we have a better idea', u'no  so who because right now  we are in that place  so the only thing that we can truly do is', u'that we bring  what is this what we are referring to as yoga as a living experience', u'yoga does not mean twisting your body', u'yoga does not mean standing on your head yoga does not mean holding your breath', u'yoga means in some way you have transcended the limitations of your physical nature you are beginning to experience life as a', u'larger possibility not just this physical form that you are once this becomes a living experience', u'sharing and living together we become a common experience everywhere', u'does it mean we are going to start communes and everybody will live together no we can run', u'businesses in a more inclusive way we can create a more inclusive', u'economic model and this need not be done by government policy this can be done by private individuals', u'because there are companies which are almost as large as nations today', u'there are companies which budgets which are bigger than nations  so it is very much possible', u'that business can be run in a more inclusive way right now', u'we are thinking only of profit our idea of profit is very', u'short term kind of idea', u'if you really want to run your company if you are thinking in terms of your company prospering in the next 100', u'200 500 years continuously', u"then it's very important that you make your customer your partner that you make everybody else in the society your partner", u"whatever you are manufacturing or whatever you're selling or whatever the business sees", u"whether you're selling a safety pin or a computer or a spacecraft", u'essentially the business is about human well being', u'if this is', u'this comes into the consciousness of every business person if this comes into the consciousness of building every business that', u'essentially this is about human wellbeing  we do it in so many ways  but fundamentally', u"it's about that if this awareness and consciousness is instilled in the businesses on the planet", u'then you can find the capitalistic way of living need not mean disparity can mean well being to everybody', u'sadhguru i read the other day that', u'that for every dollar in government investment', u"that in developing countries that there's  7 00 now in private investment", u'so', u'how do we use yoga to ', u'yoke in the the private corporations that are looking just at their bottom line to end up really having development', u"that's fair and just", u'in the last 20 years i have', u'largely focused on the business leaders because', u'there was a time a few hundred years ago where the most influential leadership on the planet was religious leadership ', u'later on when the military machines', u'built up in a big way the military leaders dominated the world in the last hundred years', u'democratically elected leaders have become the most dominant force in the next 15 to 25 years', u'you will see the business leaders will be the most important or influential leadership on the planet', u'the good thing about business is that a', u'businessman is willing to make a deal if the deal is good no matter who you are', u"i'm saying the old prejudice of i cannot make a deal with somebody is going away  and they're willing to make a deal now", u'anything is sustainable only if it is beneficial to both the parties', u"nothing can be sustained either in the marketplace or in marriage unless it's beneficial to both the parties", u"only when it's truly beneficial to both the parties this can be sustained", u'this is slowly sinking into the business leadership  i have seen in the last 20 years', u'prominent business leaders their way of thinking is very very different than what it was', u'my essential work has been to move individual leaders from their personal ambitions to a larger vision', u'because a larger vision means', u'then the business is', u"sustainable for a long period of time if it's just your personal ambition the world will work against you if you have a larger vision", u'the world will work with you  this is a big difference', u'so this is something that is slowly sinking and you will see if you see annual meetings of major', u"businesses what they're talking if you look at the world economic forum if you look at various economic", u"you know assemblies on the planet you will see they're all", u'beginning to talk about a larger vision how to make a difference rather than how to make a profit', u'this is become the language of the business these days it still has to manifest in a big way', u'but at least the language has changed from profit to making a difference', u"thank you  sadhguru when you look at societies all across the world there  there's a huge gap between", u"what's available to women and what's available to men ", u'the', u'sustainable development goals address this how', u"what's the role of gender equality in yoga ", u'the yoga means transcending your physical nature on one level', u'if you transcend your physical nature where is the question of being a male or a female ', u'you being a male or a female is relevant only in a few spaces in your life in bathrooms and bedrooms', u"rest of the places i don't see why you should recognize somebody as a man or a woman", u'why are we identifying people with reproductive organs if you must use a body part at least use the brain', u'i', u'think a', u'small gender difference that is there between us to fulfill a certain aspect of our life is being stretched too far i', u'think this is from another period where it was not possible for a woman to participate ', u'because of variety of physical situations in the world', u"and that is largely leveled today in most parts of the world and it's rapidly changing everywhere  i would say", u'i think a more active effort is needed at least by law in most nations it is 100 percent equal', u'by practice there is still', u"discrepancies which has to be worked at i feel it's a generational thing", u'once the older generation moves out the anger generation is not looking at it that way anymore at least i see that in all the', u'asian countries it is only people beyond 60 years of age who think on in this mode the', u'younger people are not thinking that way anymore', u'so grow', u"i'm just going to ask you one more question because i want to save time for the audience", u"who've been waiting to talk to you and i ", u'can you', u'tell about how you conceived the world in 30 years', u'what i see is for the first time for the very first time in the history of humanity', u'human intellect is sparking like never before', u'more people in the planet today can think for themselves than ever before in the history of this', u'human existence', u'so once human intellect begins to spark like this', u'unless something is logically correct and scientifically verifiable', u'it will fail in future you may be willing to listen to a few things', u'but your children are not going to listen to anything that does not make sense to them it does not matter', u'from what authority it comes from or in other words  we are moving into an era', u'where', u'authority cannot be the truth', u'truth will be the only authority in future  we are getting there because ever buddy is beginning to ask', u'questions  and people are not afraid to ask questions anymore  so this is bound to happen once this happens', u'human', u'aspiration for wellbeing has to have a logically correct and scientifically ascertainable', u"methodology  and it's a matter of tremendous", u'importance that today the international yoga day has been', u'declared in the last one year it was mooted by the prime minister', u'but it was almost like the world was waiting for it as they mentioned', u'177 countries never before', u'in the history of united nations all of them agreed upon one thing as they agreed upon yoga', u'it looked like they were waiting for it  yes  the world has been waiting for a scientific and a logically correct', u'solution for human wellbeing the aspiration for human wellbeing will not stop', u'unless we provide a proper scientifically structured', u'methodology', u'than people in terms of well being will move towards chemicals', u'this is a deep a grave concern in the world the number of people moving towards alcohol and drugs in the last 25 years', u'must be maybe 500 2 000 percent more than what it was 25 years ago', u'this is mainly because in pursuit of human wellbeing', u'there are no logically correct answers to their questions', u'that is the reason why human beings are seeking these kind of solutions', u'unless we provide this', u'this is a natural progression  i see in the next 30 years to 50 years there will be a big moment towards a', u'scientific process for inner well being and this is the right time to be here at this', u'forum and', u'this yoga becoming a worldwide thing we must understand yoga is not an indian thing', u'if you want to call yoga  indian  then you must call gravity european  okay ', u'because yes it it originated from that place because', u'india is one place where for a few  millennia  we had', u'uninterrupted time to look deep in words and', u'to look at the human mechanism in at most profoundness as to how this functions  what is the ultimate ', u'possibility within this human mechanism  this is taken a few', u'millennia to understand and arrive at this possibility and', u'yoga i want this message to go the science of yoga is not just about health', u"it's not just about fitness it is an ultimate solution for every aspect of human existence", u"there is different types of yoga's yoga can be taught in different", u'dimensions the ultimate possibility of', u'raising beyond our physical nature the ultimate possibility of knowing life in its fullest way', u'the word yoga means union the word yoga means', u'one who has', u'experienced this union  we', u"need not 1 to 5 yogi's we need millions of them who have a sense of union with the rest of the universe", u'particularly those who hold', u'responsible positions in the world they must come to this experience because leadership', u"essentially means you have the privilege of touching other people's lives", u'what you think what you feel when what you do every single thought emotion and action', u"either makes or breaks people's lives  that's what leadership means", u'when you are given such a privilege', u"it's very very important that you are in a state of yoga that you experience life around you as yourself", u'if we if any of us feel the work', u'that we are doing is important the first and foremost thing is we must work upon ourselves', u'it gives me deep honor and pleasure to first give the floor to', u'undersecretary general', u'ambassador bejoy  nambiar who will also be delivering a message on behalf of the secretary general  mr  ban ki moon', u'i shall just be delivering the message of the secretary general', u"on tomorrow's international day of yoga", u'yoga is an ancient physical mental and spiritual practice that', u'originated in india and is now practiced in various forms around the world', u'the word yoga derives from sanskrit and means to join to or to unite', u'symbolizing the union of body and consciousness', u'yoga balances body and soul physical health and mental well being it promotes', u'how many among people and between ourselves in the natural world ', u'recognizing its universal appeal the united nations general assembly proclaimed', u'21st june as the international day of yoga', u"this year's observance of the international day of yoga highlights the important role", u'healthy living plays in the realization of the sustainable development goals', u'adopted last year by all 193', u'united nations member states as', u'exercise yoga has multiple benefits', u'physical inactivity is linked with a number of non communicable diseases such as cancer diabetes and', u'cardiovascular diseases which are among the leading causes of illness and death worldwide by improving fitness', u'teaching us how to breathe correctly and working to diminish stress yoga can help to cultivate ', u'healthier', u'lifestyles', u'practicing yoga can also help raise awareness of our role as', u"consumers of the planet's resources and as individuals with a duty to respect and live in peace with our neighbors", u'all these elements are essential to building a sustainable future of dignity and opportunity', u'for all on', u'the international day of yoga tomorrow  i urge everyone to embrace healthier choices and lifestyles', u'to commit to unity with our fellow human beings regardless of ethnicity', u'faith age gender identity or sexual orientation', u'let us celebrate this day and every day as members of one human family sharing one common', u'precious home', u'thank you', u'may i now give the floor to the permanent representative of bangladesh sir ', u"we deeply appreciate the indian government's initiative to have the international day of yoga", u'we have learnt a lot from the yoga masters', u'especially the perspective as to how yoga can contribute in the attainment of global peace', u'sustainable future and in turn the realization of the sdgs', u'what i understand without peace of mind and harmony in the body  how can we think we can change the world ', u'first we have to change our own world', u'by which what i mean is how we leave ', u'breathe eat', u'think and aspire if we are not fit for the purpose of contributing to sustainable peace in the world', u'we will remain as bystanders and not as active', u'agents of change i can share my own story with my colleagues and others present here', u'i had been suffering from a very bad bout of sciatica problem for the last two months at times the pain was', u'debilitating i have gone through serious pain medication followed by physical therapy and acupuncture', u'in fact i am just coming here from my sixth session of acupuncture treatment i', u'realized that i suffered this problem', u'because of accumulated lifestyle related problems which included long hours of sitting standing', u'stress from the work and also from the family for the constant change of places of postings etc', u'during the last eight weeks of my ordeal i reflected on my life and future course of action', u'i read a lot and search the internet for answers', u'and i finally came to the conclusion that yoga is the answer to my situation', u'although i did some yoga in my college days my biggest mistake was i that i discontinued that', u'perhaps if i continued i would have never faced my present predicament', u'now the bhujangasana or cobra position', u'which is also known as mckenzie something is critical for the health of my spine there are many other essence or', u'positions which can help me get my strength back as i feel a little better and able to practice those', u'the essence will not only help gain my physical strength', u'but it will contribute to my mental strength through the meditational aspects of yoga', u"i thought i'll share my most recent experience", u'so that others like me in similar lifestyle situations can also learn and prevent the situation that i am in', u"let's do yoga every day and not just one day in the year  thank you", u'may i no offer the floor to the distinguished permanent representative of georgia excellency  i was thinking about asking', u"questions  but in fact it's not as much as asking questions", u'but how what you told us echoes in in all of us and', u'it really does it really does because what we what we take from here', u'from all this wonderful conversation that that we just had is how', u'complex things are indeed very simple', u'if we', u'indeed try to', u'as a', u'person who is really honored and humbled to be here as a representative of my country who was one of the', u'177 who co sponsored', u'yoga international day', u"i'm an also a practitioner rather a very bad student to the school that i'm", u'attending', u'that school is called yoga in daily life  which is in united states in many parts of eastern europe particularly', u'headquartered in rajasthan in katou', u'led by vishwa guru sri swami maharaja nanda ji and what i learned from my', u'personal experience because after all the oneness is sharing this personal experiences also is', u"what patanjali said that it's about ", u'having your mind free of disturbances  and if we indeed attain to be free of disturbances', u'we find peace with our mind that can really transcend and', u'somehow start this chain reaction of', u'peacefulness and oneness that we all long for particularly in in this', u'organization', u"i'm glad that we have so many colleagues by now or calling from", u'bangladesh my good friend who sits next to me is also', u'avid yoga', u'practitioner and many and it is indeed', u'probably high time what you just mentioned when prime minister of india ', u'said that we needed', u"international day of yoga it came in date on the right right time and i'm glad that i was here on the right moment and", u'right time thank you for your presence here', u'thank you for your blessing and indeed if we try to i think we can really attain that', u'we are without disturbance', u'and we find this oneness and unity and we take those', u"17 goals one by one and i really hope to and i'm looking forward to that day where we will no longer have this beautiful", u'poster', u'behind you because we will have that', u'completed because sdg is in a way to me is', u'somehow', u"manifestation of our common failure too that we have to talk about as dg's", u"but it's good that we are starting to talk about it", u'and we are making it happen hopefully and i believe in that yoga will create that', u'that will permeate our work in this organization in this chamber and other words  thank you very much on shanti', u'okay  now open the floor to the distinguished permanent', u'representative of liechtenstein excellency you have the floor i came from the probably most non', u'spiritual angle possible to yoga i was essentially dragged against my will 17 years ago', u'by a den girlfriend into yoga class and', u'you know i viewed myself as this', u'big soccer player and cyclist and all these other things and thought really this is not for me and', u'to my credit i had to say already after the class well  there is something there', u"and that is something that is worth exploring  i've been doing yoga ever since and", u"if there's one thing that i believe i will be doing until the end of my life  it is yoga because everyone can do it", u'every person of every age of every state of health really', u'yoga is for everyone which is i think one of its wonderful', u'qualities', u'the other thing is even if you come from that non spiritual place that i came from', u"you realize over time that something happens with you  and that there isn't it there is for me today", u'no  other way of', u'connecting with myself with my mind', u'with my body', u'the way i can in yoga sometimes i find out in when i do yoga that i before i did it', u"i didn't know how i was that day at the moment  i do it", u"i do i feel how i am and i'm able to connect to myself and that's also", u'i think really the precondition for being able to connect to connect', u'with others i', u'you know in looking at the theme and in thinking about this', u'for me the connection is very simple', u'the sdg agenda', u'you know tells us  we know what the problems are', u'we know what the solutions are ', u'we have to simply change our ways to get there  and then we can do this together', u'and i think this is ryoga can make a huge contribution', u"if you think it's not for you try it one time and", u'i think it will be for many of you actually i think it is for everybody and', u'one of my you know small moments of happiness in life today is to take a person to yoga', u'because that just makes you happy', u"and this is why i'm offering a class tomorrow morning to some of your permit to some of you in the room", u"and you're going to come say it with many others  and i really look forward to that  thank you so much", u'for now i have the honor to recognize another yoga master', u'we have with us in fact yoga matta keiko  i cover has joined us for this event all the way from japan', u'she not been a sama', u'in da state distinguished guests your excellencies ladies and gentlemen', u'spiritually i come from a tradition and lineage that from the time immemorial', u'have kept and shared with humanity the teachings of yoga', u'yoga is a science that especially with meditation', u'facilitates the harmony of the body the emotions in the mind', u'when these elements are in harmony the individual becomes calm and peaceful in his heart if', u'the individual is calm and peaceful in his heart this permeates in the community and thus in the world i', u'can attest from my own experience that by learning ', u'these practices it is possible for everyone to awaken your own energies and achieve peace love and harmony i', u'deeply believe that if that if we as individuals feel peace and harmony in ourselves that', u'this will lead to love and peace being spread throughout the world  i thank you very much for enabling me to be present today', u'thank you', u'yoga matter for that message of love may i now offer the floor to the distinguished permanent representative of nepal i', u'come from nepal from the eastern hills of nepal a place in an environment', u'which is extremely conducive for yoga  and i also come from a family and community', u"practicing yoga  but then i'm always worried about this question of accessibility", u'it has to do with the commercialization of yoga today', u'the commercialization and hundreds and thousands of the different types of yoga', u"getting into the heads of young minds and and different easy's of people", u'mostly also in terms of fashion in the forms of fashion', u'what would be you wise guidance to us ', u'to deal with the perhaps unnecessary or over', u'commercialization of', u'yoga', u'whatever becomes reasonably popular there will be enterprise around that', u"you shouldn't be surprised when you step out on the", u'time square people will be selling yoga t shirts and yoga whatever whatever  okay ', u"we shouldn't be distracted or disturbed by these things this is a part of a social thing it happens", u'at the same time the core of yoga is not disturbed in any way on the surface there are', u'small distortions here and there i', u'would say for the larger public to start with', u'like this year when you know about four months ago', u'when i came to know that over 9 000 children below 18 years of age committed suicide in india and', u'all', u'1 700 below 13 years of age committed suicide', u'it i just thought', u'if our children start committing suicide we are doing something fundamentally wrong a', u'child is a fresh life a child is an exuberant life a', u'child should be a bundle of joy', u"instead of that they're deciding to take their own life which is deeply disturbing", u'this is not a statement about the child who took his life  but this is a statement about all of us', u'what are we doing with our societies ', u"so after cough i said let's touch 10 000 schools", u'but today with the cooperation of various state governments  we are touching nearly 30 000 schools over 20 million children', u"why i'm saying this is why this has become possible is", u'because we are offering what is called as oppa yoga ', u"oopah yoga means pre yoga or sub yoga why this effort towards opu giri's ", u'if you offer yoga however  innocuous the practice may look to start with it has a spiritual dimension to it', u"transmitting spiritual dimension to an unconscious population  we're not ready for it and", u'without a certain level of expertise in the teachers could be responsible over a period of time  so', u'we are teaching oppa yoga which has mainly', u'physiological and psychological benefits and', u"here you can't do anything wrong", u"it's on the video all the teacher has to do is make corrections and make sure people are not doing it wrong i", u"think it's a good way to spread yoga in the world is true yoga", u'oopah yoga the word for yoga in indian languages today has acquired the meaning of being useful', u"but actually it originates from this that it's a pre yoga or sub yoga or a", u"start up start up yoga it is and it's best to start that way with large populations because when you start off an", u'unconscious spiritual process for people', u'many of them may not be ready for it', u"even if it's a good thing even if good thing happens to you when you're not ready for it things may not work very well", u'so', u'oopah yoga is a very', u'distinct way and a safe way to take yoga to the world', u'large scale after this happens once they feel the benefits once they experience  what difference', u'it makes they will naturally seek yoga in a more', u'serious manner and that is when yoga should come into their lives this could saw the concern that you expressed', u'but at the same time somebody is doing something funny in the name of yoga', u"it doesn't concern me because those things will always happen", u"but it's good that even commercial establishments are talking yoga  this means  it's really on i", u'will now call upon mr  herman bravo who is the president of the yoga club right here at the un mr ', u'bravo you have the floor', u'yoga is more than an instrument of personal transformation', u'yoga has as many of the speakers have mentioned', u'particularly sadhguru a', u'social dimension all that because the word yoga as tao remember us yoga means union', u'union between the body and the mind', u'union between us and other human beings', u'union between human beings and nature and it is because of that', u'interdependence and that', u'interconnection that', u'we are able to solve many of the problems  we have many problems  but we have to be optimistic because the solution is', u'by changing ourselves', u'many of these strategies organized by the un they have a political', u'meaning they have a technology access to technologies', u'and they have the will at the political level', u'but all that is not going to work unless we go at the individual level', u'yoga means personal transformation and because of that', u'the international day of yoga should be a wonderful opportunity', u'to remind all of us that every day in our life should be a yoga day namaste  thank', u'you i now give the floor to mr ', u'nate erman of the who is the executive director of the office of the world health organization here at the united nations', u'miss barrat  do you have the flow ', u"it's a great pleasure and an honor to attend", u'celebration today and indeed this is a very unusual event for the united nations because it is deeply reflective', u"and it's not", u'composed of a prayer', u'prepared speeches that people deliver in a more formal way', u'it actually moves all of us here to think deeply of what is being said  what is being done ', u'what is being conveyed by you here ', u'and how we can individually and collectively respond to this poll of the international yoga day  i', u"have spent five years of my life in india before coming here in new york  and of course for me  it's something very", u'special to be here today at this day and', u"it's special because i", u'you mentioned', u'sadhguru that we cannot call or', u'compare and say that yoga is indian', u"but it comes from india and indeed it is india's gift to the", u'humankind to all over the world and it is very special because of that and i could see', u'the', u'impact of yoga practice on', u'communities in india so it makes a different', u'difference  and this is why this is such a great gift of civilization', u'the whole country in india every quarter of it breathes essence of yoga and it is the civilization', u'calm of yoga that has moved me when i was there', u'in my work  we are dealing with health issues  it is no news now that yoga is very good for health', u'but we also know now that health is no longer standalone', u'one of the sustainable development goals it is actually determinant for any other goal to to be achieved', u'therefore yoga has a very different meaning and different indeed interconnecting nature because it does', u'help people to feel better', u'you better breathe better act better', u'unite better come into', u'interconnectedness which is indeed essential for sustaining our planet and connects planet to people ', u'so therefore of course', u'we know today ', u'proven through many clinical trials that', u'yoga helps in many conditions mental health conditions', u'depression heart conditions many other conditions joint and and so on so this is not new but', u'there has been', u'traditional resistance to integrate yoga practice and other perhaps', u'traditional medicine practices which are of course available worldwide but known also in india', u'to integrate them to the allopathic', u'medicine and', u'this resistance is slowly being overcome we as w cho are trying to put our', u'our', u'support into this process', u'recently this year in may in fact', u'india has signed and i would say landmark agreement with the world health organization to promote traditional', u'medicine yoga included and to ensure quality and safety of these traditional practices', u'but more so to', u'integrate these practices into our', u'health services', u'primary health care and all other services that we know so it is now', u'deeply understood that as all of human beings need some or another kind of health services', u'be it vaccination if if they are very healthy or any other more serious', u'services they also need to practice yoga because it prevents many illnesses it also gives peace of mind', u'it', u'teaches us how to cope with all those ', u'different things that modern life', u'stress puts on human brain and therefore  we', u'stand forward and we want to support promotion and include version of yoga into', u'medical practice all over the world we will collaborate with india on that', u'but my question to to you would be is there any good secret beyond of what you have said ', u'how we can bring these different dimensions of health together integrate them in a better way and', u'make sure that yoga is no longer seen as something separate from', u'from what we do in health services traditionally  thank you  thank you very much for being here today', u'when', u'our commitment has to shift to health not to a particular system', u'people are married to a particular system most of the time and they defend that system at any cost no matter what ', u'every system in the world has something to contribute', u'but in so being committed to health we are committed to those systems because of this there has been a lot of', u'dislocation in how health can come about', u'so in southern india in the rural part of', u'tamil  nadu we brought this about', u'these five dimensions', u'allopathy', u'sita', u'ayurveda unani and yoga together', u'practice along with the naturopathy way of doing things it is done miraculous things to the populations', u'we were the first pilot project by the irish', u'project when it started 10 years ago now  i should become a ministry', u'i think yesterday or in the last week they have declared a eyes university which means ayurveda yoga', u'sit down and all these things put together', u'this we started almost 15 years ago on today', u'it is an active part what we have done is we have medical vans which go with a an', u'aliphatic doctor  and i sit the doctor plus  we have created over', u'one hundred and twelve  or thirteen', u'village gardens where we grow herbs over 100 and odd ', u'different types of herbs in a common piece of land where people are taught how to make use of it for small things like', u'stomachache headache fever for the children diarrhea these kind of things all our grandmothers knew how to treat this', u'unfortunately even for these people are going to the doctors today and', u'the way it is being treated with elaborate medication', u'generally in rural  india', u'the cost of the medicine if you fall sick for 15 days it takes a year for you to recover', u'with the economics of the family gets hit for almost a year', u"if 15 days somebody's down and they visit the doctor and the volume of medication and treatment that happens kind of", u'economically sets them back quite a bit  so we our', u'commitment is to health not to a particular system and', u'right now the government of india is doing serious efforts to integrate this thing and', u"we've been doing this for over 15 years very effectively", u'i must tell you a simple thing in rural  india which can be i was just last one week', u'i was in africa even there  i thought this is something that will work  we created  what is called as a wave of health', u'about simple things how health can be created with within the family for every family', u'one of the things that was done', u"i won't go into all the details one simple thing with it was", u'every home should have a papaya tree a banana tree a moringa  tree and a patch of greens', u'this transformed health situations in such a big way', u"you won't believe such a small initiative such a simple initiative  what a difference", u"it is done to people's lives like this small initiative can be brought because", u"considering the economics of those families  it's very important  we need to come up with solutions", u'that works for them in this yoga practice has a significant role because', u'creating a vibrant', u'healthy vibrant and effervescent', u"population is very very important to fulfill the sustainable goals if we don't create that kind of population", u'we will be only talking about sustainability  it will not happen  we need to create this and the goal is', u'the tools of self transformation should not be in the hands of a guru or an', u"organization or some other authority the idea is to bring this into everybody's life like today", u'everybody owns a toothbrush which is created oral health just like that everybody should have', u'some tools for self transformation it is with this kind of', u'commitment that we are going ahead and', u'there is a big support now in the world wherever we go in the remotest parts of africa', u'that i was there in the last one week it was incredible to see that all of them know about yoga', u'i know this twenty five years ago when i went into rural india in a big way', u'they knew what is coca cola  but they did not know  what is yoga ', u'but today in the remotest part of africa people know  what is yoga  this is transformation in many ways', u'thank you said gucci  and how would you like to reflect on this questions like to thank you all you ', u"there's been so much beauty in this room and so much intelligence that of", u"what the world is all about and what we are all about and what we're going to do about it and", u'i think that', u"it's so it's", u'absolutely fantastic to sit here and listen', u'to all of the things that i pondered for so many years and wondered about', u'not always finding the answers', u'but today was a revelation and a very special thing to happen to the whole world in', u"this room you've started something", u"that we've needed for a long time  it's out in the open now", u'yoga is beautiful', u"but yoga's only beautiful if we use it and we make it part of our lives", u'i want to thank your i', u'now give the floor to mr  rajeev leela  who has joined us all the way from texas', u'if you could help us understand the role of a guru of a teacher not in the true academy sense where', u'stem', u'professor teaches me science and technology  but rather', u'coming from humanity and that you know that that union among all of us', u"when you say i said guru you're saying an uneducated guru", u"that's what it means", u'because', u"you don't come to set the guru to know about the scriptures you don't come to set the guru to know about rituals", u'because the only thing that i know is i know this piece of life from its origin to its ultimate and this all i know', u'by knowing this by inference  you know just about everything because', u'everything is made the same way', u"today there is something called as a constructional theory where they're talking about how the atom and the cosmos are essentially", u'fundamentally same design only the sophistication and complexity is multiplying', u'so there may be on the you and me are made the same way only the complexity has multiplied', u'having said that', u'in what way is a guru relevant means ', u'you trying to walk an uncharted terrain ', u'every year i trek in the himalayas in nepal and tibet', u'once you go into the mountains', u'that illiterate sherpa who is there who has not been to school ', u"but who if he says right you turn right  if he says left you turn left you better do that otherwise you won't come back", u'you do that because he knows the terrain', u'the same goes for this', u"this is just an inner terrain  it's best to walk with somebody who's already walked the path", u'otherwise', u'simple things will become complicated  what is next door you will go around the world and come back to it ', u'all this complication about for example', u'today if you are to the word meditation people think something very difficult to do', u'to put it simply first of all the word meditation english word meditation does not describe anything in particular', u"if you sit with your eyes closed  they're saying you're meditating", u'with your eyes closed you can do japeth aparna dhyana samadhi junya', u'there are any number of things you could do or you might have just mastered the art of sleeping in vertical postures', u'it happens', u'so', u"when we say meditation we must understand it's not an act  it is a quality", u'it is like you want flowers in your garden if you want flowers in your garden', u"you don't have to sit there and do flower meditation", u"you don't have to think flowers you have to think soil  men your water sunlight", u"have nothing to do with flowers  but if you do those things flowers will happen because it's a consequence right now because", u'we have gotten into this madness of being a goal oriented society  we are interested in the flower', u'we are not interested in the plant', u'this is the fundamental that the yoga will change within you you understand that you have to handle the process', u'right for a consequence to happen so in yoga there is a saying', u"that if you're goal oriented your one eye will be on the goal that", u'means you will find your way only with one eye', u"which is an inefficient way of doing things if you use both your eyes to find your way it's much more efficient  so", u'why is a guru needed it can be done without it', u"i'm asking you a simple question", u'even to learn abc the alphabet you needed a teacher', u'but you could have learnt it by yourself', u"maybe you don't take in a lifetime  but the teacher taught it to you in a month or two  that's a big difference", u'so like somebody was talking to me and they asked what is this guru about i said this is the gps a', u'living gps a guru positioning system  you know', u"if you want to find your way  it's best in uncharted terrain", u'unknown terrain', u"it's best to walk with somebody who's already done the terrain once or many times", u'otherwise simple things will become very complex', u'my pleasure to recognize', u'miss denise quatro', u'who is the chair of the international yoga day committee at the united nations and an executive board member of the united nations ', u'stop recreation council enlightenment society denise you have the floor the international day of yoga committee at the un', u'came into existence last year in the summer after the first international day of yoga', u'sri  chinmoy years ago his vision was to have peace meditations with the staff and he started the yoga club which', u'german is the president of how do you see the un system ', u'meaning the secretarial staff who work here the diplomats from the different countries', u'business and the ngos civil society who tried to implement the sdgs', u'how do you see yoga bringing us all together  thank you so much', u'this is being said again and again about peace so we need to look at this', u'when we say peace or mental peace as people are talking about it ', u"today even so called spiritual leaders are talking about peace being the highest goal in one's life  but", u'i would like to ask you please look at your life  and see if you want to enjoy your dinner tonight', u'even if you are not ecstatic at least you must be peaceful', u'to enjoy your dinner if', u'you want to enjoy the people around you at least you must be peaceful and happy if you want to enjoy a walk on the', u"street you must be peaceful and happy otherwise  it's not possible", u'so what is very fundamental to a fundamental requirement in our life ', u'unfortunately  we are pushing it as an ultimate goal of our life to be peaceful is not the highest thing it is the most basic', u'requirement if a human being cannot even be peaceful there is really nothing that they can do', u"this means that you're not even able to harness", u'your body and mind the way you should', u'to look at it from one perspective', u'all human experience has a chemical basis to it what you call as peace is a certain kind of chemistry', u'what you call as joy is another kind of chemistry', u'blissfulness another ecstasy another agony and the kind', u'anxiety fear tests rest tension  whatever  you call it every human experience', u'has a chemical basis to it', u'we have not been thought about how to deal with this when i say how to deal with this as is as a', u'technology if you want to look at this as a machine', u'this is the most sophisticated piece of technology on the planet the question is', u"to deal with this high level of technology have you read even the user's manual that's a question", u'yoga means it is the users manual of how to conduct this one', u'i would say when you ask this question how to bring all these diverse people together in this organization', u"it's best to start with the simplest process", u'which does not even need a specific allotment of time ', u'this is where opa yoga will become useful people can sit in their work', u'spaces and right there they can do it three minutes', u'anytime they feel like it  he does not need a specific condition', u'he does not need a specific time if they see the benefit which they definitely will in a matter of two weeks time', u'they will see a distinct benefit doing it wherever they are it does not need any kind of specific discipline or time or', u'other conditions required for normal', u'proper yoga to be done  i think this would be a good way to integrate them because', u'this predates all religion  this is not about you versus me', u'this is why i said this is not indian because a science cannot be indian yes it originated from india as', u'indians we are proud of it', u'but it does not belong to india the very fact that united nations has declared an international yoga day me', u'india has gifted it to the world it does not belong to india anymore  we', u"it's it's not something that we have to possess and identify with", u'the significant aspect of my personal work has been', u'to remove all the frills of culture that yoga had acquired through this  millennia of transmission', u'slowly whatever you do in a particular culture it will acquire cultural frills', u'so one thing is to take off all the cultural frills and present it as an absolute science and the technology for well being', u'this is an important thing in an organization like this where there are people from every nation', u'there are people from every kind of denominations every kind of faith every kind of beliefs every kind of ideologies', u"it's very very important that yoga is brought as a proper science", u"not as a cultural thing not as an indian thing  it's very important to do that", u'you']

have already claimed the mantle of being a good student  ', u'so i think i am free to claim the mantle of being a good guru', u' ', u'i think it s a deal  ', u'now  for a good student ', u'a good student will not look for a good guru because ', u'if you re a good student ', u'you learn from everything ', u'you re not looking for a good guru ', u'even if you meet a very bad one ', u'you will learn a lot from that ', u'how you should not be ', u'that is also important  ', u' yes ', u' in a way ', u'this is what happened to me ', u'when my longing came  i looked ', u'i met so many people

it s a very big thing ', u' like  as a director ', u'i always tell my technician what not to do ', u'i never tell them what to do  ', u' so  for a good student  there is no problem ', u'wherever he

that heroine', u'film heroine', u' film heroine ', u'   you fell in love in your younger age ', u' me  oh no ', u' now you love human being ', u' no ', u'they were enough girls around in my town  ', u'i didn t have to look to mumbai  ', u' now let s come to his sphere now  please ', u'is that guruji has been talking very fondly about his chamundi hills ', u'and i m fortunate enough to have visited chamundi hills', u'and i shot one of my film called krodhi on chamundi hills ', u' oh really  ', u' yes sir ', u'so  i m very fond of mysore locations and all of those ', u'i made pardes and all that ', u'so i remember i was making film called krodhi in 1978', u'and there was a scene i shot', u'because i thought that was the right location for this scene ', u'can i explain you one minute the scene part of it ', u' mhmm  ', u' it was a dharmendra and pran scene ', u'that one criminal has entered into the team of saints in disguise ', u'the guruji of that team accept him as ', u' there re lot of saints who don t need any help from outside  ', u' so there was a scene', u'when the criminal asked guru ', u' don t teach me about this god and destiny  and all this ', u'i know it all  he said that ', u'i wrote the  i wrote dialogues ', u'he says ', u' there must be a very smart and very shrewd guy 1000 years back ', u'who created these two worlds called god', u'and the other world called fate ', u'he created world god because he wanted his children to follow what he said ', u'what he wants them to believe ', u'so he made them a fear of god ', u'and fate he created the world', u'because when he child fails in following all the principles laid down by him ', u'he says it is your destiny ', u'it is your bhagya  ', u'so i know it all ', u'and this was a question he put it to guru ', u'and guru answered him that', u'there was one shila in chamundi hill we created', u'and there was some writings on the stones ', u'he says   look at it    referring to hindi phrase  ', u'devotion is nothing but a power ', u'god is nothing but a man who is great ', u'love is nothing but bliss that you and me have to find in one another ', u'you have got a wisdom', u'but there is a layer on you of the worldly pollution ', u'so you are a man of intellect', u'but you do not realize the importance of it ', u'so this is why i remember chamundi hills ', u'because i wrote this scene there while sitting on the stone ', u' oh  hope not the same rock as me  ', u' so i thought that is how you become sadhguru', u'because you belong to chamundi hill  ', u'thank you  sir ', u'now  my short questions in my mind since my childhood is ', u'what is the difference between a rich man and a wealthy man ', u'who s really rich man ', u' ahh  one who has the new currency is a rich man  ', u' so ', u'you mean to say the man with the old currency has gone poor  ', u'poorer ', u' see  unfortunately  we have brought the world to a place  where', u'the words like rich or wealth', u'have become purely economic descriptions ', u'there was a time when people would talk about wealth of knowledge or', u'wealth of wisdom ', u'that s gone ', u'today  if you say wealthy ', u'people will only understand it as an economic wealth', u'because in many ways  today ', u'society is driven by economics ', u'there was a time  when we were overly influenced by the british ', u'at least we would discuss the weather  ', u'of course  mumbai weather ', u'there s nothing much to discuss  ', u'but today ', u'all conversations are around economy ', u'everywhere in the world ', u'everybody is behaving like an economist these days', u'because it is the economic engine ', u'which is driving people s minds ', u'it is the economic engine ', u'which is determining the nature of choices that we make in the world ', u'it is the economic opportunities  which determine', u'what  what kind of education people go through ', u'people are not studying what they want to know ', u'people are studying that which will fetch them the maximum money ', u'yes or no ', u' so  maybe a few are still marrying for love  ', u'everything has become economic ', u'in united states  a whole lot of people ', u'before marriage they re signing a contract', u'in case we divorce  what s the deal  ', u'how can two people become one when this calculation is on ', u'but the  even the idea of becoming one has been given up ', u'it s always two ', u'the idea and the dream of two people becoming one has been completely given up', u'because when economic calculation comes ', u'you become exclusive ', u'you can t be inclusive ', u'so economics are ruling us in every way ', u'so when you say richness ', u'when you say wealth ', u'we re only talking about money ', u'not just richness and wealth ', u'if you say   he s a big man in the town ', u'it doesn t mean that he has a big brain ', u'it doesn t mean that he has a big heart ', u'it means he has a big pocket ', u'nothing else ', u'this is a very poor way to exist ', u'when we do this  ', u'the ladies must know this  ', u'when economics become the main crux of everything that we do ', u'the feminine will vanish from the world ', u'or feminine will be subjugated ', u'if women have to succeed ', u'they have to become like men ', u'there is no other way ', u'masculine will be everything ', u'that means world will become utilitarian ', u'there ll be no aesthetic ', u'there ll be no beauty ', u'there ll be no gentleness ', u'everything will be a calculation  ', u'what is useful ', u'what is not useful ', u'what do i get ', u'what do you get ', u'there will be no home ', u'there will be only a marketplace everywhere ', u'in the marketplace ', u'the rules of the marketplace are like this  ', u'if i give less and take more  that means i m smart ', u'yes or no ', u'if you buy ', u'you go to the share market  you buy for less and sell it for more ', u'that is smart ', u'but life doesn t work like that ', u'life becomes beautiful', u'only when you re willing to give it all', u'and you don t care what you get  ', u'unfortunately  economics means', u'an organized approach to survival ', u'now  we ve made survival ', u'when we were in the caves  survival was a big issue ', u'we organized civilization with so much effort', u'because we thought we could leave survival behind', u'and focus on higher dimensions of life ', u'but once again  we have brought ourselves to a place ', u'or bringing ourselves to a place ', u'where survival is supreme ', u'nothing else matters now ', u'only thing is', u'we ve raised the bar of survival in such a way', u'that it doesn t matter what you have ', u'you re still trying to survive ', u'affluent nations in the world ', u'the western countries  where', u'almost every citizen has everything that is needed ', u'they re still fighting for survival  ', u'fighting for survival like nobody else  ', u'i keep asking the american people ', u' you guys  all the time talking about freedom ', u'where is freedom in your life ', u'because even if the most significant dimension appears in your life ', u'you can t take a turn ', u'i keep joking with them  ', u' you know  some time ago  2000 years ago ', u'jesus came and said   come  follow me ', u'a few people followed him ', u'but today ', u'if your jesus comes back and says   come follow me ', u'where can you follow him ', u'you have a thirty five year mortgage on your house  ', u'you have still a student loan at the age of forty five ', u'you have a car loan  you have insurance ', u'you have this ', u'you re not going to follow ', u'you got a bank to go to  ', u'you re not going to follow anything ', u'it doesn t matter even if a divine entity arrives ', u'you cannot change the direction of your life ', u'this is not freedom ', u'freedom means you should be able to change and alter your life', u'according to the opportunities that come  isn t it ', u'if something truly significant comes ', u'you should be able to turn around and do something else ', u'because we have enshrined economics as the highest value ', u'all these things are gone ', u'everything is about money ', u'and wealth means just money again ', u'most of the wealth that we have today in the world', u'is just made up in people s minds ', u'in 2008 ', u'when recession was setting in the western countries ', u'i happened to be at davos at the economic forum ', u'at that year ', u'india was running a campaign in switzerland ', u'the campaign was', u' india everywhere ', u'all the american and european business leaders were all looking very depressed because', u'recession was coming ', u'that means they had a few billion dollars less than what they had ', u'and they were all very depressed', u'so depressed means you', u'very touchy and angry with everything ', u'indian people were rubbing it in their face  ', u'i get down in switzerland ', u'huge hoardings  india everywhere ', u'on the buses   india everywhere ', u'inside the train   india everywhere ', u'so it was irritating everybody  ', u'so they asked me to handle a session called ', u'recession and depression  ', u'i said   recession is bad enough ', u'depression is worse ', u'all of you have always been complaining you don t have enough free time ', u'this is the time to walk on the beach  ', u'what are you complaining about ', u'what is it that we re complaining about ', u'so  there was a chinese bureaucrat ', u'see  the way we have structured the economic engine is such ', u'it is like that panchatantra story ', u'where a monkey is sitting on the wrong end of the branch', u'and chopping the branch ', u'if it succeeds  it will fall ', u'that s how we are right now ', u'so  i said ', u' see  the way you have s  structured this is', u'if we succeed  we shall fail ', u'that s how we are right now because', u'if you fail  you will be depressed ', u'if we succeed  the world will be damned ', u'yes ', u'the way we re going ', u'so i said ', u' it s better you re depressed', u'because  if your ambitions are fulfilled ', u'there ll be no planet left ', u'that s where we re going ', u'so this chinese bureaucrat did a wonderful thing ', u'he ', u'there was a big mirror ', u'he put one chair and he said ', u' see  there are two chairs  ', u'one chair here  one chair in the mirror ', u'they all said yes ', u'then he covered up the mirror and he said ', u' see  now there s only one chair ', u'they said yes ', u'then he said ', u' always there was only one chair  ', u'you made it up with a mirror that there are two chairs ', u'the wealth on the planet is not gone anywhere ', u'it is just distributing itself a little bit ', u'every time it slips out of your hands', u'and goes to somebody  you will get depressed ', u'he was saying it s moving to china  ', u' thank you  thank you ', u'thank you for sharing the chair also with us  ', u' here  there are two  ', u' two chairs ', u'thank you very much for saving two chairs ', u'now  the other question comes in my mind  sir ', u'about the education to children ', u'there is a slogan going on in our country  ', u'right to educate ', u'right to education ', u'and i always feel that more than right to education ', u'there has to be a right kind of education ', u'because educating c a t cat is a bat ', u'it s not a right education ', u'right kind of educations is more important ', u'that s what i feel and i say ', u'where do we lack', u'the whole process of education for the so many years ', u'see  rather century or eighty years', u'that we have not been living with the intellectual power till now ', u'we face that ', u'i say india is not intellect ', u'is economically poor ', u'india is intellectually poor at the moment', u'because there has been a big gap of the whole process of education ', u'the right kind of educations to all of our children ', u'what is your take on it  sadhguru ', u' see  india is not  definitely not poor on intellect ', u'i would say ', u' you are one ', u'we are thousands ', u' no  ', u'i speak to all kinds of people around the world  ', u'business leaders ', u'academics ', u'scientists ', u'but still i would say ', u' when i say  it means ignorance ', u' no  at random ', u'if you pick up hundred people from the street just like that ', u'either in mumbai', u'or chennai', u'or bangalore ', u'i would say they are way smarter than', u'most people that you can pick up anywhere in the world  ', u'only ', u'hey  you shouldn t clap for yourself like this  ', u'i should have left out mumbai  ', u'it is just that we do not have an organization', u'for this intellect to find expression ', u'because there is no necessary structures to find expression ', u'each person operates ', u'this is one thing about india ', u'everybody thinks he s a genius  ', u' that s our education  ', u' and you will see ', u'everybody is an expert on everything ', u'it s like ', u'if you go to a local tea shop ', u'he will tell you how virat kohli s strokes are not perfect  ', u'how he should do like this  like that ', u'he will say how narendra modi does not know', u'how to be a prime minister  ', u'what he should do ', u' we face every time ', u'a paanwala tells me how to make a story  ', u' he knows everything in the world', u'but it s just that he can t make good tea  ', u'it s just one little lacuna ', u'otherwise everything else he s an expert  ', u'we have this as a little bit of an issue in the country ', u'this is mainly because there is no outlet ', u'for this enormous intellect that country has ', u'there is no structures for people to find expression to that ', u'you just see', u'take indian people and put them anywhere ', u'they re just on the tops ', u' survivors ', u' it s not about surviving  they re thriving ', u'because once they find proper structures and they understand the structure ', u'you can t stop them', u'because there is a necessary intellect ', u'this is a consequence of a very huge history ', u'a cultural history that we have ', u'today  there are experiments to show ', u'like for example if you ', u'let us say you put the smell of this flower on some food substance', u'and keep it in front of a rat', u'or a mouse', u'and when it goes and touches it ', u'it ll get an electric shock ', u'if you do this a few times ', u'next seven generations ', u'those rats will not go towards that smell ', u'all of them understand ', u'this is their learning ', u'so similarly  within the human being ', u'a lot that was done in the past ', u'which is  which we call as samskara ', u'that means intrinsic learning that we have ', u'is still paying off ', u'or in other words  we still surviving on old food ', u'it is time that this generation gets the right stuff ', u'but that s not happened yet', u'because our education systems', u'and every system that we had', u'has been disrupted badly in a systematic way', u'because we ve been an occupied nation for nearly a 1000 years ', u'some came and just ravaged everything ', u'others came and systematically destroyed everything ', u'and they created an education system ', u'which was mainly towards obedience', u'and clerical kind of work to serve', u'her majesty s service ', u'in 1947  when we got our independence ', u'we should have seriously thought about', u'what kind of education does india need ', u'we must understand this  ', u'without any infrastructure ', u'literally without infrastructure ', u'without any kind of education ', u'our farmers are producing food for 1 25 billion people  ', u'this is knowledge ', u'why is this not knowledge  i m asking ', u'why is this not knowledge ', u'why is this not competence  i ', u'i was talking to a group of ceos ', u'i was just telling them ', u' see  i ll give you ten acres of very fertile land ', u'you do one thing ', u'i ll give you a couple of two different crops ', u'you take out the harvest  let me see ', u'all of you are mba  mba  whatever ', u'you take out a crop  let me see ', u'it ll freak the hell out of you  i m telling you ', u'it s not easy ', u'i ve personally farmed  i know what it takes ', u'it is ', u'the more educated you are  the more difficult it becomes   ', u'really', u'because it takes a very  a very  a close sense of involvement', u'with what you re doing ', u'and from this ', u'from ploughing the land to the seed to taking the crop out ', u'it is not a easy process ', u'but our farmers are just doing it like that', u'as if it s just part of their life ', u'something that they just inherited ', u'this is a nation with over 12 000 years of agricultural history ', u'the only land like that on the planet ', u'in southern india ', u'they re farming the same land for over 12 000 years ', u'there are certain records  which show this ', u'so  there is knowledge like this on various levels ', u'but we have tried to push everything aside', u'and reinvent the wheel ', u'once again  we want to learn abc', u'and do it like this ', u'so  there is a disruption in the intrinsic learning that we have', u'and the school learning that is coming to us ', u'i m saying  just read a book ', u'however educated you may be ', u'read a book and make one good sambar  let me see  ', u'it won t come ', u' yeah  that s exactly question is  yeah ', u' because we are thinking only what is written in the book ', u'a   b   c is only knowledge ', u'why is not making a wonderful sambar knowledge ', u'why is not growing a crop knowledge ', u'why is not making a pot knowledge ', u'we have very constipated sense of what is knowledge ', u'because ', u' the school system ', u'  because this has come from elsewhere ', u'some indian student in oxford  ', u'i was just ', u'not even a month ', u'three weeks ago i was speaking at the oxford union in oxford university  ', u'one of the indian students has filed a court petition', u'that he should be compensated for the boring classes', u'that they re teaching in oxford university  ', u'i was very happy  ', u'that s why i never went  ', u'that s why i never went to the university  ', u' that amazes me ', u'that is why the school system  the textbook ', u'the six answers to the exam ', u'six questions in the exam ', u'after studying whole year ', u'it really amazes me ', u'that is why i always feel ', u'what not the internal enlightenment to the children ', u' see  the problem is ', u'why we re talking about right to education is ', u'we have ', u'for example   i don t know the exact number all over the country  ', u'in tamil nadu itself ', u'we have 9 6 million children in the government schools alone  okay ', u'9 6 million children ', u'when you have such vast numbers ', u'then you have to do something ', u'what you do for the mass is never the best ', u'but what to do ', u'you have to include everybody ', u'so  some rudimentary sense of education is happening', u'because at least they must learn to ', u'if you don t know this ', u'seventies and eighties  the objective was ', u'everybody should know how to write their name ', u'a campaign was ', u'literacy means you must know how to write your name ', u'this is all ', u'that is  they were trying to move them', u'from thumb imprint to something written ', u'it did not change life in any way', u'but it was a forward movement in a sense ', u'but we must know this ', u'when the british came  around two hundred and seventy to three hundred years ago ', u'there was not a single illiterate person in this country ', u'they were amazed because', u'there were no schoolrooms anywhere ', u'there was no school infrastructure', u'but there was no illiterate ', u'everybody could read and write ', u' vidhwan  everybody was vidhwan ', u' so they wondered  how does this happen ', u'then they realized the system is so organic', u'that it is simply happening from within ', u'so the first thing they decided was ', u' we must destroy this education system', u'because if you educate them like this ', u'they will never become english ', u'see  i m the only indian left in this hall  ', u'so  this system of education that we have inherited', u'from those who occupied this nation ', u'see  we must understand this  ', u'you never take advice from your enemy  isn t it ', u'if you have some sense  i m saying  ', u'so   when they leave your country and go ', u'first things to overhaul is your political system ', u'your education system ', u'your administrative system ', u'these are things must be overhauled immediately', u'because they were created for a certain purpose ', u'for example  even today   the terminology we re using  i m saying  ', u'the district administrators in many states including tamil nadu are referred to as collectors ', u'in the british time  they were just tax collectors ', u'their only administration was to collect tax', u'and take it back home ', u'even today  our administrators are called collectors ', u'what are they supposed to collect from us  ', u'i m saying we didn t change anything ', u'we  we were just lazy ', u'we were just happy that we ve become free ', u'but freedom is a terrible thing ', u'if you do not understand the responsibility of being free ', u'freedom is a terrible thing ', u'if somebody is managing our life  it is better ', u'when we are not responsible ', u'only if we re truly responsible  freedom is a wonderful thing ', u'otherwise  freedom is a terrible thing  ', u' maturity ', u'freedom must come with the maturity  that s true  guruji ', u'i belong to middle class  brought up by middle class family ', u'and most of us are middle class people ', u'what is this middle class  ', u'i m doing well ', u'i m educated ', u'i m graduate ', u'still they call me   you re middle class   ', u'and we  most of us run the country ', u' see  this is an aspirational thing ', u'when large segments of the country were in extreme poverty ', u'the aspiration was to become middle class ', u'middle class means you have college education ', u'you may not be very rich ', u'but you re college educated  you have a job and ', u'you have a regular job ', u'usually  government employees were middle class at one time ', u'slowly  others joined up ', u'now middle class people are driving mercedes benz   okay ', u' is it in the terms of the economic development ', u'or the knowledge or the enlightenment ', u'what is  ', u'in which term they are middle class ', u' oh  it was definitely an economic description ', u'and there was a big goof up with this middle class ', u'i think it was in nineties ', u'a certain us firm came  which was ', u'i forget the name of the firm ', u'they came to do a market survey for ford motor company ', u'and they came here and they said some hundred million ', u'two hundred million whatever number of middle class families in india ', u'so ford can go to india ', u'no problem', u'because it has the largest middle class ', u'so  ford came and set up the plant at that time ', u'and they couldn t sell ten cars  ', u'then they found out ', u'a middle class in india is earning 10 000 rupees a month', u'and he can only cycle to his office ', u'no question of he buying a car ', u'it took them a while to understand ', u'everybody have their own idea of middle class  ', u'they thought middle class means', u'in america  middle class means somebody who s earning', u'somewhere between 60 000  i mean  30 000 dollars to 100 000 dollars is middle class ', u'here  at that time ', u'india s middle class is ', u'if they earn approximately 10 15 000 rupees per month ', u'they were middle class  which is just three hundred dollars ', u'so  ', u'everybody has their own idea of middle class ', u'but we can take this to another place ', u'now you are claiming you re middle class  ', u' because it always  i wonder ', u'middle class means naa idhar ke  na udhar ke ', u'neither this side nor that side ', u'neither i ve an identity  whether it s poor or rich ', u'they are clear about themselves ', u'i am poor guy  he is clear', u'i m a rich guy ', u'the middle class is neither this way nor that way  in what terms ', u'that was bothering me but you answered ', u' aspiring to be rich but haven t made it  ', u' you look at it like that', u'i a m taking all the  this golden opportunity to ask you  ', u'the question which bothers me at times', u'is about the world called democracy ', u'what is democracy', u'and what should be the relationship between the leaders and the people ', u'the government and the people ', u'and in growing democracy ', u'who gets corrupt first ', u'the leader or the people ', u'that s my question  ', u' see  the  in tamil  the word for democracy is jananayakam ', u'that means people are the leaders ', u' by the people  for the people  of the people ', u' that means there is no leader and there are no people ', u'people are the leaders ', u'that s what democracy means ', u'unfortunately  people have forgotten that they are the leaders ', u'i hear ', u'even today morning or yesterday an  evening  i was being interviewed ', u'today morning  i was being interviewed by a journalist in lucknow ', u'so  he said ', u' these politicians ', u'i said   there are no politicians ', u'they didn t fall from the sky ', u'they re just you and me ', u'somebody who s willing to do the dirty job for you ', u'what you think is dirty and you don t want you yourself or your children to get into ', u'somebody got into it for you ', u'yes  ', u'and once you get there ', u'the entire game is such that it just dirties your hands  you can t help it ', u'it s become like that  the system ', u'so in democracy  there is no leader and people ', u'it s people and people ', u' but obviously  there are leaders and there are people today ', u' that is because we have allowed it ', u'otherwise  every five years  you could stand up and become a leader ', u'that s how it should be ', u'we have not kept it mobile enough because', u'we have this tendency of', u'giving responsibility to somebody and forget about it ', u' and forget it for five years ', u' only when something goes wrong  we will scream ', u'otherwise  we don t care a damn  ', u'no  if you ', u' when it is essential', u' if you re making a movie', u'or somebody is running a business ', u'not after something goes wrong you ll attend to it as a director ', u'you are on it every moment to see it goes right ', u' yes  sir ', u' so  i am saying ', u'once you live in a democracy ', u'you must be an active participant ', u'it is not a spectator sport  to sit back and forget about it', u'and then cry when something goes wrong ', u'i m telling you  even your home will not run right', u'if you don t pay enough attention ', u'forget about the nation ', u'yes or no ', u'even your home ', u'your own family will become corrupt', u'if you re not paying attention to many things ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' you don t like it but it s true  isn t it ', u'if you don t pay  constant attention ', u'even your home will go bad and corrupt ', u'so  when this is the thing ', u'such a large nation ', u'if everybody doesn t pay attention to what needs to happen  it will go bad ', u'then we cry ', u'we have this problem  ', u'when small things go wrong  we have somebody here ', u'when big things go wrong  we have somebody there  ', u'this guy  ', u' is free  free  ', u' he is never responsible for anything  ', u'this has to change  ', u' yes  but we  i', u' see  the most beautiful thing about democracy is', u'power can change hands without blood flowing ', u'never before it s happened in human history ', u'whenever power changes  blood will flow ', u'now  power can shift from one group of people', u'to another group', u'without blood spilling ', u'which is a huge achievement  ', u' but we as individual need to understand that', u'i am the part of the democracy', u'and i m equally responsible as my leaders are ', u' see  i think one mistake we have done is ', u'in our education systems  in our homes ', u'there is no awareness about this ', u'that there are instruments in a democratic process through which', u'all of us can participate in some way   on a daily basis  if we wish ', u'this has  this awareness has not been brought to people ', u'they think if they cast vote once in ten years ', u'because one election they ll miss  you know  ', u'then the election day they went to goa  ', u'one they will miss ', u'one they will vote and they think they are very responsible citizens', u'because they voted once in ten years ', u'that s not how it works  you need an active participation ', u'then only democracy will work the way it has to work ', u'right now  our idea of leadership is', u'if we find a good leader  we will start worshipping them ', u'a good leader does not need worship ', u'what a leader needs ', u'if somebody is ', u'a competent leader comes at the top  what he needs is ', u'he needs many layers of leadership ', u'so that he will find traction to what he wishes to do ', u'but you will see  if a good leader comes ', u'he will spin on the spot because there is no traction down the line ', u'either there are worshipping people or those who re busy with their own stuff ', u'so  we need to understand ', u'democracy means we have taken the nation into our hands ', u'we need to make it happen ', u'somebody will guide it ', u'somebody will make policies ', u'somebody will take some decisions ', u'but the nation is run by the people ', u'if we don t get it  then we will always be just complaining ', u'we will not have a great nation ', u'if we want a great nation ', u'we have to stand up and take charge of this country ', u'taking charge of the country does not mean', u'usurping power tomorrow morning ', u'no ', u'where we are  what roles we have to play ', u'we should be doing our best ', u'people are always talking about politicians being corrupt ', u'but i m asking you ', u'if there is no policeman on the street ', u'how many people will stop at the red light ', u'i think about ten percent ', u'i m being generous  i know  ', u'about ten percent ', u'the rest ', u'if you elect any one of them as a chief minister or the prime minister  what do you think they will do ', u'because they re law breakers anyway ', u'i see  you know  normally i land in coimbatore late in the night ', u'ten o clock  eleven o clock  one o clock  whatever time ', u'and i m driving from the airport ', u'red light  i stop ', u'there is one little tvs moped guy who s parked behind me ', u'kee kee he will do  ', u'then i don t go till the green light comes ', u'he comes next to me and says like this   ', u' what s wrong with you ', u'he thinks i m a fool  all right ', u' exactly ', u'exactly ', u'   his thing is ', u' no policeman  what are you doing here ', u'go ', u'so  if you make these people into ', u'if you put these people into positions of power  what ', u'people who re on positions of power are on spotlight ', u'so everything that they do is seen ', u'but corruption is all pervading  isn t it ', u'within the house ', u'between a girl child and a boy ', u'there is a distinction ', u'this is corruption ', u'between a right hand and left hand ', u'one is superior   one is inferior  this is corruption ', u'so  corruption is not just up there taking money or whatever ', u'corruption is on all levels  isn t it ', u'there is no evenhandedness about life ', u'we ve brought this to everything ', u'this has to go means', u'spiritual process is needed ', u'if i can  share something', u'i think i must have shared already ', u'i ll leave it  ', u' spiritual process is important ', u' because an inclusiveness is needed ', u'you must transcend looking at things as superior and inferior ', u'one is higher  one is lower ', u'you learn to look at everything ', u'this is one thing that happened to me very early ', u'i realized i don t know anything ', u'so i started paying attention', u'to just about anything ', u'one thing i discovered with people around me was ', u'they could pay attention', u'or they would pay attention', u'only to those things that they thought is important ', u'rest of it ', u'they learned to ignore ', u'i couldn t do this', u'because i couldn t decide what is important ', u'i found the ant crawling on my ', u'on the floor was far more important to me', u'by  than my father  who was asking me to do something at that moment ', u'i m saying  ', u'yes  it was ', u'it is so for your child also  isn t it so ', u'your child is looking at the ant ', u'is he not', u'does he not think the ant is more important than you at that moment  ', u'yes  he does ', u'because it s more interesting than you  ', u'it is  ', u'it is the finest piece of mechanics that you can find on the planet ', u'if you could build an automobile like an ant ', u'whoa ', u'it would just go anywhere  you know ', u'so  i got into this mode of paying attention to just about anything', u'because it never occurred to me something is more important ', u'something is less important ', u'my father believed that he s a very  he s a disciplinarian  ', u'tch  so he thought  ', u'so evening  seven o clock to nine o clock in the evening ', u'me and my siblings must study something  textbook ', u'and he will be sitting there reading some magazine or newspaper ', u'so that we study ', u'i ve no issues about all that ', u'if i just open my book', u'i just open somewhere  ', u'i never had the habit  ', u'even today  i don t have the habit  ', u'i always open somewhere ', u'if i read one page ', u'i know the author s mind through and through ', u'so i don t read beyond that  ', u'so i open somewhere and on the page  i find a small speck of something ', u'you know ', u'some flaw in the page ', u'if i just look at it ', u'it held my attention ', u'entire two hours  i was like this  ', u'looking at the spot ', u'i never read a single word ', u'nor did i look up anywhere ', u'i just got absorbed into this little spot ', u'there was enough in that little spot to keep me engaged for two hours ', u'why i m saying this is ', u'this is the biggest mistake we re making with life ', u'we are setting this up in our children s minds  ', u'this is god ', u'this is devil ', u'this is superior ', u'this is inferior ', u'this is mine ', u'this is not mine ', u'in this  you re causing corruption ', u'you re bringing corruption to the infant', u'to recognize one thing as high ', u'one thing as low ', u'one thing as mine ', u'one thing as not mine ', u'here  corruption has started ', u'if you make this child that you brought him up like this into a prime minister ', u'of course he will be corrupt ', u'whatever  if you ', u'by getting into a position of responsibility and power ', u'it only gets magnified ', u'somebody doesn t just get corrupt the moment they get there ', u'they ve been corrupt all their life ', u'they ve been trained in corruption by their parents', u'and their society ', u'now  it got magnified because the opportunity is magnified ', u'so  corruption is not up there ', u'corruption is everywhere ', u'if you are concerned about corruption ', u'just sit at home', u'and see how many things are there in your life ', u'which you need to iron out ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' if you don t take this out ', u'you have no right to complain about corruption', u'because corruption is in your home ', u'corruption is in your mind ', u'corruption is all around you ', u'it is just that those who re in positions of power ', u'you expect them to be clean ', u'i also do ', u'but i don t believe that will happen', u'unless down the line also we aspire for that in our lives ', u'because the kind of people we are ', u'that s the kind of leaders we elect  isn t it ', u'we have some aspiration to change it', u'but we are not determined to change it ', u'something that is negative ', u'something that is rotting in a society will not go away', u'unless we re determined to change it ', u'strong determination to change it ', u'otherwise it will just go on ', u'rot is not something that you can simply get rid of', u'because rot spreads by itself ', u'it is cleanliness  which is ', u'which doesn t spread by itself ', u'you have to do the cleaning ', u'but rot spreads by itself ', u'so corruption spreads by itself ', u'if you want to bring cleanliness ', u'you have to strive ', u'first of all  bringing it into your life ', u'otherwise it s not going to work ', u'we ll only talk about it ', u' sadhguru  you re a master of knowledge and history  mythology  everything', u'and i feel that i m a child of ancient india ', u'and i know indian 1000 years back ', u'indian hundred years back', u'and indian today', u' 1000 years ago  this s how they looked  ', u' not to the getup ', u'how i have changed from 1000 to hundred to today', u'and why i have changed ', u'is it a better', u'or need to be better ', u' what is the change  you re asking ', u' yes ', u'what s the change as an indian ', u'how much we have changed ', u' when we talk about india ', u'1000 means we re talking about recent times ', u' ancient times ', u' recent ', u' recent  1000 years  yeah ', u'i say 4000 5000 years ', u' so  india as a culture exists for over 12 15 000 years ', u'at one time  we became a nation with enormous intellect ', u'enormous capabilities ', u'very crucible of science  mathematics  astronomy ', u'the greatest scientists in the world have acknowledged ', u'modern science could not have taken a single step', u'without the mathematic that came from india ', u'so  there were tremendous minds that we evolved because', u'we had what is called as samskriti ', u'today  we have isha samskriti school  which is on these lines ', u'samskriti means  ', u'sam means equanimous and exuberant ', u'kriti means way of doing it ', u'that is  getting life to a place  where it is exuberant and equanimous ', u'if you keep your life exuberant and equanimous ', u'now this life will be full fledged life ', u'this is the aspiration of every life ', u'whether it is an earthworm ', u'or a bird', u'or a tree ', u'all of them are aspiring to become full fledged life ', u'so  is a human being ', u'only thing is we know what is a full fledged earthworm ', u'we know what is a full fledged bird ', u'we know what is a full fledged tree', u'but we do not know what is a full fledged human being ', u'no matter what you become ', u'still you feel it s not enough ', u'it doesn t matter what you have become ', u'in somebody else s eyes  you might have become big ', u'but within you  you know this is not enough', u'because what is human is a limitless possibility ', u' expansion ', u' because for every other creature  nature has set two lines ', u'between these two lines  they live and die ', u'for a human being  there is only bottom line ', u'there s no top line ', u'so most human beings are suffering their freedom ', u'if you re suffering your bondage  understandable ', u'but if you re suffering your freedom  that s a bad thing ', u'but that s what is happening ', u'human problem is ', u' what to do with myself ', u'whatever you do  it s not enough ', u'whatever you do  it s not enough ', u'if you had come like any other creature ', u'your survival taken care of  everything is fine with you  isn t it ', u'eating  sleeping  reproduction  if it happens ', u'you were fulfilled ', u'but that is not the thing with human ', u'when these things are in question  they are big ', u'once they happen  they are nothing ', u'so  this transition  what you re talking about ', u'historical movement of human beings in this country ', u'there was a time when we hit a peak ', u'but we became so absorbed in finer aspects of life ', u'what  that we did not have fighting men ', u'our biggest strength was ', u'we were placed in a geographical crucible  where we were well protected ', u'we called this hindustan ', u'not after a religion  as people think it is today ', u'or some people think it s after a language ', u'no ', u'a land which lies between himalayas and the indu sagara or the indian ocean  this is hindu ', u'why we worship these two geographical features is ', u'we knew our well being comes from these two features ', u'the himalayan ranges and the indian ocean protected us ', u'so we could focus on the development of the human being ', u'when every other society was constantly ravaged by external forces ', u'we remained untouched for a long period of time ', u'but when people came ', u'they did not come as invaders ', u'they just came in few hundreds  ', u'hundred  two hundred people ', u'they were actually bandits ', u'they wanted to rape  loot and run ', u'but then they found ', u'people were so docile ', u'people were deeply involved in spirituality ', u'mathematics ', u'music ', u'astronomy ', u'somebody who s looking at the stars can t fight ', u'someone who is singing music cannot fight  ', u'somebody who s into  you know  counting numbers', u'or doing mathematics cannot fight ', u'they found this was such an easy land ', u'bandits became emperors ', u' they stayed there only ', u' they stayed back ', u'why run  ', u'they decided to stay back and they became emperors ', u'and these are not people with any administrative skills ', u'they were barbarians ', u'so  they ruled that way ', u'so immense suffering happened ', u'but we had an evolved sense of intellect and philosophy and ideology', u'through which we survived ', u'it doesn t matter how you beat them ', u'they didn t fight back but they survived ', u'they not only survived ', u'they kept their culture ', u'they kept their samskriti ', u'they kept their tradition', u'to whatever extent they could and survived and survived and survived ', u'after over a 1000 years of invasions and all kinds of rules over us ', u'still this is the only culture on the planet ', u'which still has a flavor of its indigenous origins ', u'everybody else is totally wiped out  ', u'but it has not been easy ', u'it has not been the best of times ', u'what was the greatest economic power on the planet', u'just three hundred years ago ', u'we became one of the poorest nations in a matter of two hundred and fifty to three hundred years ', u'i think at about two hundred and seventy years ', u'we became the poorest nation', u'because everything was shipped out ', u'but still  we re coming back once again ', u'we have an intellect ', u'we need a determined leadership to wake us up a little bit ', u'we re little sleepy  you know ', u'because for generations ', u'ten fifteen generations ', u'our mothers have taught us  never confront a problem on the street ', u'if you see a problem  come home  ', u'yes ', u'this is what our mothers have taught us', u'because this is the mentality of an occupied nation  ', u'don t raise your head ', u'put it down and come home', u'because if you raise your head you may lose it ', u'but if we want to generate leaders in the nation ', u'we need people who seek problems and confront problems on a daily basis', u' ', u'the moment you seek and confront a problem ', u'half the nation resists ', u'it doesn t matter what s the problem  ', u'see  everybody was talking about black money  all right  ', u'it was one of the conversations always going on ', u'when they don t have money ', u'they would say somebody else has black money ', u' the money that i have is white ', u'what you have must be black    ', u'this has been the mindset ', u'but when you try to take some action ', u'just look at the voices all over ', u'is it the best action ', u'is it the wrong action ', u'that s not the point ', u'we can debate it endlessly ', u'but the thing is ', u'it is some action in that direction  ', u' we talk about sanskriti ', u'you said about sanskriti ', u'and i wonder since my childhood', u'that in my home and other places also ', u'i always find pundits chanting sanskrit mantra ', u'we get married ', u'the mantras are all in sanskrit ', u'whether we understand them or not ', u' you re not supposed to understand all that  ', u' that is what i was told ', u'and everywhere ', u'i find mantras and pundits ', u'on all auspicious occasion ', u'or whatever the occasion is ', u'and we respect somewhere ', u'like the back of our mind  we respect our language ', u'ancient language sanskrit ', u'but when it comes to our kids to learn sanskrit ', u'we tell them ', u' learn that language  which gives you a job ', u'this will not give you a job ', u'and we are very shy', u'to allow them to learn sanskrit ', u'why it is so  sadhguru ', u' see  this is  as i said ', u'we have experienced ten  twelve  almost fifteen generations of abject poverty ', u'so  when we re in such a state of poverty ', u'our only concern is our children should somehow survive ', u'somehow get one degree ', u'get a job  ', u'this used to be the mantra in sixties and seventies ', u'get a government job somehow ', u'or become a doctor ', u'that s the best thing ', u'your life is made ', u'somebody else gets sick but your life is made  ', u'this is coming from a certain fear', u'that your children may not survive ', u'if they don t pass this  this  this examination ', u'they may end up on the street ', u'because that s all the options there were ', u'they ', u'it was not a false fear ', u'if your chi  child did not get educated ', u'unless he was super talented with something ', u'most probably he ll end up as a street bum ', u'that was a fact ', u'but slowly things have changed ', u'our economic situation has changed dramatically ', u'whether we want to recognize it or not ', u'in seventies how you were living and how you are living today ', u'there is a phenomenal different in the material wealth ', u'so today  our children have many more options ', u'we can little go slow on this job oriented education ', u'still  there is a large segment of india ', u'which still has to go that way ', u'but we ', u'those who re reasonably well to do', u'can go little slow on their children ', u'i created three different dimensions of education ', u'one is rural education ', u'which is called isha vidhya ', u'to bring awareness to this ', u'tomorrow we re golfing at wellingdon  ', u'to bring awareness to rural education ', u'this education is designed purely to get these children', u'out of their economic and social pit they re in ', u'this is ', u'from the age of six  they re learning english language ', u'within one year  they become fluent in english language', u'and they start working on the computers ', u'this english language and computer is their passport out of the village ', u'this is the goal ', u'this is run in a certain way ', u'we have another school called isha home school ', u'this is for the affluent ', u'this is run in a completely different way', u'with an enormous inclusion of sport  art  theater ', u'all kinds of music ', u'every kind of thing that you can add to aesthetics to it ', u'the school itself is created in a very aesthetic way ', u'so the children experience a different dimension of life ', u'and these children live in groups of twenty in a household', u'with a dedicated couple ', u'who are parents for these children for the first five years ', u'and the next five years  they ll have another set of parents ', u'they move into a different house ', u'these children grow up with enormous exposure to all kinds of talents ', u'for example  now i made their eleventh and twelfth ', u'which is two years  into three years ', u'i said   in our school  it s three years ', u'because we have invested so much', u'on music  art  dance  theater  all these things ', u'the moment they come to eleventh standard ', u'many parents go marks mad ', u'suddenly  marks  marks  marks will come ', u'they want to drop the music ', u'they want to drop every other art they ve learnt ', u'so i said three years ', u'so extra this one year ', u'whatever they are good at ', u'they will become much more proficient in that ', u'if they are good musicians  they will go into that ', u'if they re good in theater  they ll go into art ', u'we re exposing them to leadership  management  business ', u'variety of things ', u'but your children will get out of the school one year late ', u'i think you can afford it because you re well to do ', u'you have only one child or maybe two children ', u'it s all right ', u'your child gets to work one year later ', u'it s perfectly okay ', u'initially  everybody thought it s crazy ', u'now everybody wants to be there ', u'another dimension of education ', u'here there is no formal education ', u'there are only six things that they learn ', u'they start with yoga ', u'kalari payattu  which is the mother of all martial arts ', u'classical music ', u'classical dance ', u'sanskrit language ', u'english language ', u'this is all they study ', u'first four years  these six subjects ', u'after four years  they will drop any two of them and keep that four ', u'and after another two and a half to three years  time ', u'they ll drop two more ', u'and the next five years to six years ', u'they will do only two subjects ', u'they will become experts in that ', u'you must come and see these children ', u'you won t believe how they are ', u'they are incredible because this is focused towards building the human body', u'and the human brain to its fullest ', u'if you want something to perform ', u'first thing is you must build the machine ', u'you must build the machine to a higher level of capability ', u'then only it ll perform ', u'right now  the biggest problem with the modern world is', u'we are too goal oriented ', u'we want to enhance our activity without enhancing who we are ', u'this is why everybody is talking about stress ', u'whatever simple jobs they re doing  they re stressful', u'because they have enhanced their activity without enhancing themselves ', u'it s like you take your maruti 800 on a racetrack ', u'it will fall apart  ', u'it s not built for that  i m saying ', u'it s okay to go to your office ', u'if you race it  it ll  it ll break up ', u'so similarly  if you want to enhance your activity ', u'you don t worry about the activity ', u'if you enhance the human being ', u'he will perform the activity according to his capability ', u'so  this is focused on just developing the human being ', u'these children are in another zone altogether ', u'fantastic ', u'i', u'you won t believe it ', u'i must tell you this ', u'the first batch  i was to initiate them about five years ago ', u'when they become fifteen years of age', u'they stay with us from the age of six to eighteen ', u'when they become fifteen ', u'three years they take brahmacharya ', u'it is three year period they must take', u'and at eighteen  they must go off ', u'it is not compulsory beyond that  ', u'till that point because we want them to focus ', u'when i had to initiate them at the age of fifteen ', u'they go for a sixty days of silence  okay ', u'total silence   ', u'i have to initiate them ', u'i want to see how the children are doing ', u'about three four days before the initiation ', u'i go there to see them ', u'30 in the evening ', u'okay ', u'in a day  at least six hours ', u'they are sitting with their eyes closed', u'doing sadhana ', u'and all kinds of sadhana  ', u'at least about eleven to twelve hours of sadhana ', u'in this  at least six hours  they re sitting with eyes closed ', u'30 in the morning ', u'the first batch was only fourteen ', u'today its grown into big number ', u'i go there and sit with them ', u'nearly half of them are girls and the rest are boys ', u'i went and sat ', u'i  i just looked at these children ', u'they were literally glowing ', u'i sat there and wept', u'because i was not like this when i was fifteen ', u'i know that very well ', u'these children are literally glowing like lights ', u'they re just sitting like this ', u'unmoving ', u'i just sat there for over two hours ', u'they didn t move a bit ', u'they just sat like stone ', u'i just bowed down to them and came that ', u'this is fantastic   ', u'they are only fifteen  fifteen year old children  ', u' that is exactly when i said', u'the right kind of education ', u'this is the right kind of education ', u' yes  but at the same time ', u'as i said  we are a huge population ', u'if we want to improve our education', u' it has to grow ', u' if we want to improve our education ', u'if we want to improve nourishment ', u'if we want to improve the traffic situation ', u'if we want to improve anything in this country ', u'we have to reduce our population ', u'there is no other way  ', u' one very interesting question in my mind i ve been facing since my childhood', u'we are talking', u'all due respect to the belief of every guru and', u' no  you don t have to respect my belief', u'because i don t have any  ', u' when you are talking about the adiyogi', u'the great lord shiva ', u'i remember my mother used to go to lord shiva s temple', u'and i used to accompany her ', u'and she would tell me that lord shiva belongs to the three lokas  ', u'dharti ', u'akash ', u'pataal ', u'so my father brought one globe showing the geography of the earth', u'and i asked my mother ', u' is lord shiva', u'you re talking about the three worlds   ', u'i turned the globe ', u'i said  ', u' does these americans know lord shiva ', u'so is lord shiva territorial or universal ', u'that still question lies in me  ', u' let s understand this in the right context ', u'the word shiva  ', u'shi va means that which is not ', u'that which is  is physical creation ', u'that which is not  is that which is not physical ', u'that which is not  where can it be ', u'in india or america  ', u'or on this planet or in another galaxy ', u'where can it be ', u'it s everywhere ', u'so  there is a dimensionless existence ', u'so we called it appropriately  ', u'shi va  that means that which is not ', u'today  modern scientists are saying', u'that nearly ninety nine percent of the cosmos is empty ', u'but not that there is nothing  ', u'there is something but it is not something ', u'because our idea of something is', u'we should be able to perceive through five senses ', u'see right now ', u'what you can see and what you cannot see is this ', u'you can see my hand because it is stopping light ', u'anything that is not stopping light  you don t see  isn t it ', u'right now  there is air here  which you re breathing ', u'which is most vital from your  for your existence ', u'but you don t see it ', u'you don t see the air unless you live in delhi  ', u'that s the privilege of being in the capital city  ', u'now  if you look up in the sky  you see the stars ', u'but stars are a small happening ', u'the real thing is the vast emptiness ', u'so this we referred to as shi va  that which is not ', u'today  modern scientists are saying', u'this vast space has a tremendous amount of energy ', u'but it is not any of the energies that are measurable by us ', u'like electromagnetic waves ', u'or weak nuclear energy ', u'or strong nuclear energy ', u'or electrical systems ', u'or microwaves ', u'none of these things ', u'it is none of the measurable energies ', u'but there is no denying it is tremendously powerful ', u'so we said shi va means that which is not ', u'and we said it is in the lap of shiva that creation happens ', u'at the same time ', u'we called adiyogi also the shiva', u'because he perceived that which is not ', u'you are who you are', u'people call you a director  a film producer  why ', u'because you perceived something ', u'if you did not perceive that  they would not recognize you as that ', u'so we recognized adiyogi as shiva', u'because he perceived that which is not ', u'because he perceived that  we called him also shiva ', u'then maybe there are any number of people', u'at least in southern india ', u'almost ninety percent of the males are named after shiva ', u'we call that man also shiva', u'because we know if he does the right things ', u'he can also realize that he is shiva ', u'we named our dog also shiva ', u'yes ', u'because we know he is also made of the same stuff ', u'but he does not know ', u'but we must remind him by naming him shiva  ', u'we ll call the dog also shiva  shiva  no problem ', u'in another country  in another religion ', u'they would be very insulted if you named your dog by their god s name ', u'but you ll see in the villages ', u'dogs in', u'only in the cities  they have this problem  ', u'all their dogs have english names  ', u'this is because', u'this pet dog business came from the english people ', u'for us  dogs were there on the street', u'and we never taught of taking dogs and fondling them like this   ', u'only the english were doing it', u'because they were away from home', u'and they must have been feeling lonely  ', u' that s the reason  yes ', u' now you see in india ', u'every so called middle class family  ', u'all their dogs have english names ', u'so  we will call the ultimate reality as shiva ', u'the one who realized that ', u'the adiyogi  as shiva ', u'one who did not realize that but has the possibility ', u'we ll call him shiva ', u'we ll call the dog also shiva', u'because he is also made of the same stuff ', u'but he cannot know ', u'but we want him to hear that sound ', u'so every time we call him shiva  shiva  shiva ', u'we hope that we will evolve one day  ', u' thank you very much for enlightening us ', u'about the real meaning of shiva  so much', u' and for those of you who do not know ', u'now  on this twenty fourth of february ', u'we are unveiling a  a face of adiyogi ', u'which is hundred and twelve feet tall', u'because  adiyogi', u'adiyogi offered one hundred and twelve ways', u'in which a human being can realize his ultimate potential ', u'hundred and twelve ways to do it ', u'so as a way of honoring him', u'and also to bring back this dimension ', u'that your well being is not in looking up or looking down', u'but looking inward ', u'when we looked up in search of our well being ', u'we became hallucinatory ', u'then as modern societies ', u'as science and technology came ', u'we started looking out for our well being ', u'once we started looking out for our well being ', u'in pursuit of human well being', u'we have ripped the planet apart ', u'true well being will happen to a human being', u'only when they turn inward ', u'to bring this revolution back into the world ', u'for the next generation of people particularly ', u'we built this iconic face ', u'and a book is also ready now ', u'the idea is to move people inward ', u'not up ', u'not out ', u'in  ', u'in is the only way out  ', u' sadhguru  i', u' can we show the image of adiyogi  is it possible ', u' yes ', u' on the screen ', u' but i must say', u' this is the largest face on the planet ', u' yes ', u'i ve gone through your book ', u'it s amazing amazing book and so much enlightenment in it ', u'but the best line which i found was', u'that you said in your book ', u' your joy  your miseries  your love  your agony  your bliss ', u'all lie in your hand ', u'some are suffering their failures ', u'some are suffering their consequences of their success ', u'some are suffering their limitation', u'and some are suffering their freedom ', u'what s the way out  ', u' in is the way out ', u'because all human experience is caused from within us ', u' it s within us ', u' everything that ever happens to you happens within you ', u'what happens within you must happen your way  isn t it ', u'right now  we are trying to fix the world to fix this one  ', u'it s not going to work like that ', u'if you fix this one  ', u'then we can create a world the way we want it ', u'but right now  we think by fixing the world ', u'this is going to be all right ', u'it s not gonna happen like that ', u' great  great enlightenment ']

an individual human being is capable of seeking ', u'a crowd cannot seek anything ', u'so in many ways when you get identified with a particular belief system ', u'you have become a crowd ', u'you are no more an individual ', u'if you ask anybody  they will say', u'okay  for example  reincarnation ', u'they ll say reincarnation  ', u'if i say this is all rubbish ', u'they will say   but gita says this ', u'so  you have an authority which said it ', u'because krishna said it  it must be true ', u'in future ', u'somebody will say  sadhguru said it ', u'it doesn t matter who said it ', u'the question is  ', u'do you want authority to be the truth', u'or do you want the truth to be the authority ', u'if you want the truth to be the authority in your life  ', u'because that s the only thing

know ', u'wanting to know ', u'longing to know ', u'seeking to know ', u'and the possibility of knowing becomes a living reality ', u'otherwise  you believe one thing ', u'i believe one thing ', u'i

comes to the crunch ', u'we will hack each other ', u'not once ', u'thousands of times we ve been doing the same thing ', u"won't we ever learn ", u'so  what you re asking is not about reincarnation ', u'or in a way', u'you re asking what happens beyond death ', u'tch  some things you know best only by experience  ', u'now ', u'essentially what you re asking is  ', u' what is the nature of my existence ', u'it gets clothed in so many things ', u'just now ', u'some time ago i was in conversation with harsh ', u'he burst car tires ', u'he', u'what ', u'he took me to middle east ', u'he made me cross pakistan border  many things ', u'but fundamentally what you re asking is  ', u' what is the nature of my existence ', u'if you want to know the nature of your existence ', u'you just have to pay attention to this one  right now ', u'tch  you said a word which i keep on demolishing wherever i go ', u'you said  corporate world ', u'there is no corporate world  ', u'there is just one world  ', u'so  the moment you belong to one world ', u'i belong to another world ', u'intergalactic fight will happen  ', u'so  we are just in this world ', u'if you pay attention  how you have happened', u'right now  when you and me sit here ', u'well ', u'i have my physical presence ', u'you have your physical presence ', u'and everybody else has their physical boundaries  ', u'this is my boundary ', u'that is your boundary ', u'that is somebody else s boundary ', u'this physical body which is defining your boundary right now ', u'how did it happen ', u'in bengal ', u"maybe it's just fish and rice  ", u'what else do you eat  hmm ', u'what else ', u' that s not your diet  ', u' rasagulla ', u' yeah  maybe ', u'so fish  rice  and rasagulla in the head  ', u'no  i m saying you re sweet ', u'so  fundamentally ', u'we accumulated this body by ingesting food ', u'what we call as food is just actually a piece of the planet ', u"it's good to get it now ", u'if you experience this now ', u'if this becomes a living reality  ', u'you understand this is just a piece of the planet ', u'little bit of topsoil i picked up', u'and i m walking around ', u'well  you can carry your topsoil in style', u'or in a clumsy manner  ', u"it's up to you ", u'but it is just topsoil ', u'if you don t get it now ', u'one day you will anyway get it from the maggots ', u'yes  ', u'one day when they bury you or burn you ', u"anyway you will get it  isn't it ", u'so what you accumulate ', u'whatever you accumulate can be yours at the most for now ', u"but cannot be you  isn't it ", u'anything that you accumulate you can claim ', u' is mine ', u'but if you say   it is me ', u'it amounts to', u'even by medical definition', u'you are psychologically off  ', u'yes  that s what it means ', u'suppose i say ', u' i m this furniture ', u'people know i have lost it ', u'this is happening every day ', u'food appears in your plate ', u'you say   this is my food ', u'you eat it and immediately say ', u' this is me ', u'so if you want to know the nature of your existence ', u'one simple thing you can do is ', u'tonight before you fall asleep', u'if this is a genuine question', u'is it a question or is it entertainment ', u'is it a genuine question ', u'it will become a genuine question', u'when your bones start creaking', u'and you know mortality starts knocking on your doors ', u'oh  am i saying something wrong ', u'do you know all of you are mortal ', u'i am saying  do you know', u'even if you re in the upper regions you will die one day ', u'that s all i m asking  ', u'hello ', u' yes ', u' is it okay ', u' yes ', u' this is not my wish ', u'i ll bless you with a long life ', u'but with or without me ', u'you ll anyway die ', u'lot of people believe other people die  ', u'no ', u'you and me will die  ', u'you and me will die ', u'not today ', u'we don t want it today', u"but when it's time we will die ", u'so everything that you have accumulated', u'will become meaningless on that day ', u'right now if you learn ', u'tonight before you go to bed ', u'if you can sit on your bed ', u'everything that you are not ', u'everything that you have accumulated ', u'for two minutes you keep it aside', u'and just go to bed', u'go to sleep ', u'if you sleep with this much awareness every day ', u'one day you may wake up enlightened ', u'yes   ', u'you will know the nature of your existence ', u'because right now if i tell you ', u' sanjiv ', u'the nature of your existence ', u'your atma', u'you know how atma came ', u'it is a drop of paramatma   ', u'i can tell you many things ', u'but till it becomes a living experience for you ', u"it is just a story  isn't it ", u'stories will add color to our life', u'but will not bring truth and liberation to our life ', u'you re talking about salvation ', u'if the longing for salvation is genuine ', u'then stories are only entertainment ', u'it doesn t matter whether the story came from ancient scripture', u'or story came from a contemporary guru ', u'it is just entertainment ', u'but there are methods ', u'i m ', u'i m not known to be an entertainer ', u'i do brutal things in a pleasant manner  ', u'very brutal things but in a pleasant manner ', u'people like it ultimately because it works  ', u'ultimately all that matters in this life is', u"what works and what doesn t work  isn't it ", u'yes ', u"whether it's in business ", u'in your world and my world  ', u'in every damn world ', u"what works is ultimately matters  isn't it ", u'what doesn t work  however pretty it is ', u'doesn t jell after sometime ', u'so if we are seeking salvation ', u'if', u'don t seek salvation ', u'just ', u'instead of waiting for that day', u'when you will sit on your death bed and wonder', u'what is this all about ', u'tonight you sit on your bed and wonder', u'what is this all about ', u'let', u'you come down to reality ', u'right now you re running away with your psychological drama to such an extent ', u'the existential is completely missing ', u'if you pay attention ', u'you will see', u'and you will constantly be aware of your mortal nature ', u'that means you know you shall also die ', u'this is not a negative thought ', u'this means your time will get organized in a most sensible manner ', u'when you know you re on a limited leash of time ', u'your time will get organized in a most sensible manner ', u'if you re conscious that you will also die', u'and it could be any day', u'okay  we are planning for this many years ', u'but nobody here has come with a guarantee card ', u'have you ', u' no ', u' so it could be today ', u'if you re conscious of this ', u'do you have time to do anything that doesn t truly matter to you ', u'you will do only what really matters to you ', u'when every human being is doing only what truly  truly matters to them ', u'this is a beautiful world ', u'right now they re doing too much rubbish  ', u' being a very deep cricket enthusiast', u'and now somewhat involved with the sport ', u'i see with admiration ', u'the rise and rise and rise of virat kohli  ', u'i see his energy on the field ', u'i see his energy off the field ', u'i see the way he s transforming and rewriting the rules of the game ', u'the t20 format', u'140 to 160 was par score ', u'he s redefined it ', u'now 190 is a par ', u' 250', u' 250  240 ', u'there is something within him that propels him more than others ', u'there are many people who are talented ', u'there are many people who have this ability ', u'but there are few who realize this ability ', u'what is it that takes one to realize', u'that he can do a little more ', u'he can inspire more ', u'he can create more ', u'he can create new standards ', u'is there something from within', u'or is it something from outside ', u'what is it ', u' i have also been watching virat kohli with interest', u'because', u'i have seen every great batsman in the last forty  forty five years ', u'very few have hit the ball the way he s hitting it ', u'probably the only other person that i can think of is vivian richards  ', u'who used to hit the ball like this ', u'but he did not have the sane', u'same sense of mission that this boy has  ', u'he just played for fun and you know  an island  caribbean culture ', u'and he kind of didn t take it so seriously ', u'or did not go at it with a certain zeal', u'with which this boy is going ', u'but i think he was the only one who was striking the ball', u'the way this boy is striking today  which is very rare ', u'most people  who have watched only cricket on the television ', u'don t understand this probably ', u"it's one of the most dangerous games on the planet ", u'a hard ball is coming at you over hundred and thirty  hundred and forty kilometers per hour', u'and this is the only sport where the ball is pitched', u'and it swings this way  that way ', u'which gives you a fraction of a second to make your decision', u'how to handle that ball ', u"it's  it's a very dangerous game ", u'you must  you know  there re bowling machines ', u'they may be there in kolkata ', u'yes ', u'the bowling machines are there ', u'young men  i m telling you ', u'don t try hundred and forty kilometers ', u'at eighty or ninety kilometers ', u'just  make', u'set the bowling machine at ninety kilometers', u'and stand there and see how the ball comes at you ', u"it's crazy  okay ", u"so  every ball is different  the way it's coming at you ", u'so it needs to be handled ', u'everybody who is there we must understand is very good  ', u'they may look clumsy  they may get out for zero', u'but they re very good with what they re doing ', u'but somebody stands out like this ', u'this reminds me of', u'there was a motorcycle rider who is known as', u'whose name was kenny roberts ', u'who won the world championships five times in a row ', u'people couldn t believe it because', u'you have to win sixteen races across the country to get to the championship ', u'all the machines are prepared by the top companies', u'and the talent is at the highest level ', u'but winning five in a row was considered unprecedented and impossible ', u'so they asked him ', u' how do you do this ', u'so he said ', u' i go out of control with control   ', u'i understand that very well  ', u'i live every step of my life like that  ', u'always out of control  but with control  ', u'this is what everybody is seeking ', u'they want little madness in their life ', u'but they don t want to go insane ', u'but their longing for safety and security', u'makes them insulate themselves from that little madness ', u'then they wonder', u" what's happened to my life ", u"it's becoming boring and no good ", u'they try to step out ', u'then they get hit by something ', u'they again build walls around them ', u'this process is going on ', u'so when you take an example like this  ', u'one thing is the zeal ', u'another thing is loving what you re doing ', u'really loving what you re doing ', u'that s what you want to do ', u'this once happened ', u'i was just walking into the chennai airport', u'and the indian hockey team was leaving for germany for champions trophy that year ', u'a few years ago the indian hockey team came and spent', u'a week or ten days in the yoga center', u'and we had helped the previous team', u'but this was a new team ', u'so when i walked in  kps gill   was there', u'and he saw me and said ', u' sadhguru  you must come and speak to the boys ', u'we have a psychologist who is speaking to them right now   ', u'in the airport just before they leave for germany ', u'many of these boys have never  gone out of the country ', u'for the first time  they re going ', u'at that time  half the team was from the tribal belt', u'because they all came off the tata academy ', u'so they', u'i went there to see what they re talking ', u'so this psychologist is trying to pep them up ', u'he is telling them', u"i can't repeat this in hindi ", u'but he s telling them ', u' your parents have brought you up ', u'you have to bring pride to them ', u'one billion people ', u'full bharat is watching you ', u'you cannot disappoint them ', u'these boys  ', u'these are all eighteen  nineteen year old boys from the tribal belt ', u'one billion people  their expectations', u'and their parents  honor ', u'they re just dazed like this   ', u'so they asked me to speak ', u'i said   see ', u'i asked them   do you guys know how to play hockey ', u'i asked them to bring the sticks and the', u'i played hockey right through my school and college ', u'so i said ', u' you guys ', u'do you know how to play hockey ', u'they said   yes ', u'i said   no ', u'you guys don t know how to play hockey ', u'they said   no ', u'suddenly they became ', u' no  no  we know how to play hockey ', u' then if you know how to play hockey ', u'this is all you do ', u'those seventy minutes ', u'the ball must be continuously in the goal ', u'that s your goal ', u'you want the ball to be constantly in the opposite goal ', u'don t try to beat germany and pakistan and somebody and somebody ', u'just put the ball in the goal ', u"you like to do it  isn't it ", u' yes  we like to do it ', u'said   just do that ', u'forget about bharat and your parents and everybody ', u'for some time ', u'and last', u'one of these conversations i had in hyderabad ', u'one of the film actors ', u'his final question is ', u' sadhguru  all this is okay ', u'but in cricket ', u'how to beat pakistan   ', u'i said ', u' you should not try to beat pakistan ', u'you should just learn to hit the ball ', u'there is no pakistan in the ball  all right ', u'you just have to hit the ball ', u'you don t have to beat pakistan ', u'if you try to beat pakistan with your stupid emotions ', u'you will do something stupid ', u'which has been happening continuously ', u'now ', u'i think recently virat kohli came on the television and said ', u' my only problem is i get angry ', u'i want to be like a monk  something he said ', u'whatever his own version of being', u'wanting to calm ', u'i think he needs balance ', u'with the kind of talent he has ', u'if he learns to become balanced ', u'he is going to be a phenomena ', u'he s going to be a', u'a new cricketing story on the planet ', u'not just one more player ', u'he has the necessary ingredients ', u'i said this when he was seventeen ', u'i saw him playing in singapore', u'for the under eighteen team or something ', u'he was captaining that team at that time ', u'i saw this boy playing and then only i said ', u' this guy will go far ', u'and then he vanished out of my radar for almost five  six years', u'and then he surfaced suddenly one day in the test ', u'in the indian team', u'and now he s going the way he s going ', u'he needs to balance himself ', u'if he learns to be a cool fire ', u'not a fire that burns him up ', u'then he will do things which probably has not been done for a long time ', u'i think we can give him those tools of self transformation', u'which will not take away the fire ', u'see  there are two ways to fire yourself ', u'if i get angry i can propel myself', u'this is one way ', u'but all of you know', u'whenever you re angry it propels you ', u'at the same time ', u'it takes away your sense in many ways ', u'it takes away your capabilities ', u'we can show you scientifically', u'medically  we can show you', u'how your system is getting poisoned when you are angry ', u'instead of being that way ', u'with sheer pleasantness you can drive yourself ', u'you do not know how to', u'see  there is  there ', u'we have been driving internal combustion engines for a long time', u'which have been smoking and polluting and killing us', u'in many ways but they ve been propelling us ', u'now  we are coming to engines ', u'which has no internal combustion', u'which smoothly drives', u'without a noise ', u'without smoke ', u'without nothing', u'we re just coming to that ', u'we re just coming of age with automobiles ', u"similarly  it's time humanity comes of age that", u'you learn to propel yourself', u'in a very pleasant manner ', u'i am also on twenty hours a day ', u'i m just fooling around   ', u'why do you need anger and this and that ', u'if out of sense  you can drive yourself ', u'it is not necessary you have to drive yourself with anger or hatred ', u'yes ', u'those things give you energy in a certain way ', u'but they take away your competence in many levels ', u'this boy needs tools for self transformation ', u'i think we should deliver that to him  ', u'i would like to do that to him', u'because he is a phenomena in waiting ', u' yes  yes ', u'if already not made', u'i mean he can be a much bigger phenomena', u'but he s already a phenomena not in the making', u' see  a one season phenomena will be forgotten ', u' forgotten ', u' he needs to become a', u'yes  ', u' in cricket you deal with lots of celebrities ', u'lots of kids who over a period of time become celebrities', u'and develop huge egos ', u'and when you see the game from within ', u'you see how large the egos are', u'and to the outside ', u'the ego doesn t overtake the interests of the team', u'but sometimes it does ', u'how does one  as an owner ', u'draw a line between balancing the ego', u'and the interest of the team ', u'so  if you', u'if you were to pull up a celebrity ', u'he s not used to it ', u'he sulks  ', u'then your team loses out ', u'if you don t ', u'because of his ego ', u'sometimes wrong decisions are taken ', u'so  how does one balance this ', u' this is not just in cricket ', u'this is everywhere  ', u' absolutely ', u' you give somebody to do something ', u'if they do it for three days ', u'they have reached stratosphere   you know ', u'if they do something  get little recognition ', u'if five people clap their hands ', u'they will rise ', u'so till they fall  they don t realize', u'this is not the way to play cricket  ', u"up in the air you can't play cricket ", u'you got to be on the ground ', u'so  how to deal with it ', u'there are many ways', u'but the best way is not that we don t deal with it ', u'when we  when i say we don t deal with it ', u'they need tools for self transformation ', u'what has happened with them is just this  ', u'they are still driving themselves', u'because of the euphoria of the crowds ', u'what is written in the newspaper ', u'what other people are saying about you ', u'or in other words ', u'you have not found anything about yourself  ', u'you are a product of other people s opinion ', u'everybody is saying you re great', u'and you start believing you re great ', u'no ', u'you don t have to believe anything ', u'if you re good at something ', u'you just have to keep on seeing how to enhance that ', u'it is', u'this is the problem with people  ', u'they think', u'they become ambitious ', u'ambition means you re tweaking your desire ', u'instead of tweaking your competence ', u'you re tweaking your desire ', u'which is just the wrong way to do life ', u'you don t need to be ambitious ', u'you don t need to think  i have to score hundred runs ', u'you don t need to think  i have to become a champion ', u'you just have to hit the ball that s coming at you right now ', u'that s all you need to do ', u'for this ', u'you of course need training   that s a different aspect ', u'without that you wouldn t have come here ', u'you just need the necessary alertness and presence of mind', u'to do what you have to do at that moment ', u'instead of that  they ve become stars ', u'your reputation will not play ', u"it's only which", u'your competence which plays  ', u'your reputation cannot play ', u'so  by the time they realize this ', u'many of them are flushed down', u'because there is a younger crop coming up doing things ', u'i think these boys ', u'you know  because without other exposure ', u'without  generally with education they re just coming straight into the game', u'and they fully give themselves to the game ', u"before they know what's happening ", u'they re quite lost   many of them ', u'not all of them ', u'many have matured with the game ', u'others have gotten lost with the game ', u'if they are given little education about how to handle themselves ', u'i think they ll come out on the tops ', u' greed', u'i don t know how to define greed', u'but i would ', u'in my own silly  stupid way i would define greed as', u'unlimited  irrational desire ', u' no ', u'generally greed is like this  ', u'what i want is need ', u'what you want is greed  ', u'generally  that s how it is defined  ', u'greed is a strong word ', u'we don t have to go to this ', u'why', u'greed is a consequence of a certain unfulfilled state ', u'when i say a consequence of a certain unfulfilled state  ', u'what is a human being longing for  every human being ', u'all of you ', u'wherever you are right now ', u'you would like to be little more than what you are right now ', u"isn't it so ", u'hello ', u' yes ', u' yes ', u'if that little more happens  what ', u' little more ', u' little more ', u'if that happens  what ', u' little more ', u' so  it looks like ', u'in installments  you re going towards something ', u'how much more would settle you for good ', u"let's look at it right now ", u'why go at it in installments ', u'how much more would settle you ', u'hello ', u'if i make you the king or queen of this solar system  ', u'don t look at me with hope  ', u'i ve not known to commit such blunders  ', u'even if you become the king or queen of this solar system ', u'you will not be fulfilled ', u'you will look at the stars', u'because this is the nature of the human being ', u'there is something within you', u'always longing to expand in a boundless way ', u'because you have gotten so very identified with your physical form ', u'you re trying to find this boundless way', u'through physical means ', u'when we say physical ', u"let's understand this  ", u'physicality can exist only because of a defined boundary ', u'if there is no boundary ', u'there is no physicality possible ', u'you can say something is physical', u'only if it has a defined boundary ', u'otherwise it cannot be physical ', u'so  through something which is', u'physical is the world of boundaries ', u'through the world of boundaries ', u'you re trying to reach towards boundlessness ', u'this is like you re driving your ambassador car  i', u'unfortunately  i don t see too many on the kolkata roads anymore ', u'you re driving your ambassador car', u'but you want to go to the moon ', u'you may go beyond the moon sometimes  ', u'if you try hard ', u'but you will not go to the moon', u'because to go to the moon you need a different kind of vehicle  altogether ', u'so you re seeking boundlessness unconsciously ', u'so you re trying to go towards boundlessness through physical means ', u'when it finds very basic physical expression ', u'you wanting to be more than yourself ', u'we call this sexuality ', u'all you re trying to do is ', u'something that is not you ', u'you re trying to make it a part of yourself for a few moments ', u'if it finds emotional expression ', u'we call this love  ', u'something that is not you ', u'you want to include as a part of yourself ', u'if it finds a mental expression ', u'it gets labeled as greed ', u'ambition ', u'conquest ', u'or simply shopping  ', u'if it finds a conscious expression ', u'we call this yoga ', u'yoga means union ', u'yoga means you successfully erased', u'the boundaries of your individuality ', u'because the boundaries of your individual nature are essentially your making ', u"when i say it's essentially your making  ", u'right now  let us say you re sitting here ', u'unfortunately ', u'somebody that you don t like ', u'your enemy  happened to settle down in the chair next to you', u'or in front of you ', u"you can't stand them ", u'you re sweating sitting there', u'because this horrible person is sitting next to you ', u'what usha ', u'no  no  no  ', u'your mind cannot take it ', u'but your body has no issue ', u'what they exhale you re inhaling unconsciously but no problem  ', u'yes  ', u'yes or no ', u'your body has no problem ', u'this life has no problem ', u'only your mind has problem', u'because your mind recognizes the boundary ', u'your body doesn t recognize the boundary ', u'you sit here and breathe  ', u'what you exhale  the trees are inhaling ', u'what the trees exhale  you re inhaling ', u'really if you look at it ', u'one half of your lungs is hanging out there  ', u'yes ', u'your life is not happening separately ', u'it is happening as a one whole thing ', u'you re just a pop up from this planet  you know ', u'you have seen those pop ups on your screen ', u'on your computer screen  ', u'if they ve paid only for two seconds ad ', u'it just pops up for two seconds and pup ', u'in the life of this planet ', u'you re just a two second pop up', u'and you will pop out ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' so ', u"this pop up doesn t understand it's just a pop up ", u'it thinks it s eternal ', u'its boundaries are eternal ', u'you must get this now  ', u'these boundaries are all made by you ', u'if you really fix the boundary', u"you can't breathe and you will die right now ", u'it is a transaction which is keeping you alive ', u'so this sense of boundary ', u'is wanting you to expand ', u'because you know only physicality ', u'you re trying to expand physically ', u'if somebody expands faster than you ', u'you say he is greedy ', u'if they', u'if you are expanding faster than somebody ', u'then you think you are successful  ', u' what stimulates or motivates a leader ', u'you ve got there ', u'a mahendra singh dhoni is there ', u'right at the top ', u'what motivates them to achieve more ', u' you re essentially asking what drives them ', u' yes ', u' if they re driven by something ', u'they shouldn t be leading anything in my opinion ', u'when you drive ', u'you re not driven ', u'you are driving ', u'then you re a leader ', u'if you re driven by something ', u'then you re also a slave', u'but you have a bunch of slaves behind you ', u'whether your ambition drives you ', u'or your god given mission drives you ', u'or your greed drives you ', u'or whatever drives you ', u'if something is driving you ', u'in my opinion ', u'i wouldn t call that person a leader ', u'nothing drives you ', u'i m made like this ', u'i really have no need for action ', u'if i close my eyes and sit here ', u'i can sit here till i fall dead ', u'really ', u'i can simply sit ', u'i ve simply no need for action ', u'but all the time i m on ', u'people think i have a mission ', u'there is no mission ', u'i see an enormous longing in people around me ', u"i see it's needed ", u'so i do what i can do ', u'people call this all kinds of things ', u' oh  sadhguru is twenty hours a day ', u'seven days ', u'how can he do this ', u'he must be having god talking to him every day  ', u'no ', u'this is just this  ', u'if you just pay attention to this  ', u'every human being is capable of knowing this  ', u'the very body that you carry ', u'you created from inside ', u'there is an intelligence here  ', u'there is a competence here  ', u'which is capable of transforming a piece of bread into a complex machine called human mechanism ', u'this  is the most complex piece of technology on the planet ', u'you agree with me ', u' yes ', u' those of you who re engrossed with your phones  i m asking you  ', u'this is the most complex piece of technology ', u'this  you re capable of making', u'with a piece of bread  or a mango  or a fish  or whatever you eat ', u'now  if you can tap into this intelligence ', u'even if a drop of this intelligence ', u'which can make bread into body ', u'came into conscious access ', u'suddenly life would become magical ', u'this is what every human being has to do', u'because the highest form of intelligence is right here ', u'not here   ', u"it's right across ", u'right now we re mistaking intellect for intelligence ', u'intellect is like a knife ', u'it cuts through a few things ', u'it helps you with survival', u'but it doesn t show you the nature of life ', u'it doesn t give you access to life ', u'in fact  it chops off everything ', u'if you apply your intellect too much to anything and everything ', u'everything gets chopped up ', u"it's  it's a good instrument for dissection", u'when you want to know something ', u'so  ', u'our', u'today our science has entirely become dissection ', u'this works okay when you re doing some material stuff ', u'but now  you want to know your mother very well ', u'so you dissect her ', u'no ', u'i m', u'please  this is not the way ', u'okay ', u'this is not the way ', u'you must keep your instrument of dissection aside', u'and see how to embrace and include somebody ', u'only then you know them ', u'by dissection you may see their liver  kidney  spleen', u"but you won't know that piece of life in any context  isn't it ", u'so the problem is just this  ', u'that ', u'we think a leader means he must be boom boom ', u'slogan shouting ', u'fired up ', u'no ', u'i think leadership has to mature into a place', u'a leader must be someone', u'who has transcended his own needs ', u'there is nothing driving him ', u'then he will do what is needed ', u'this is what i m trying to create with every human being in the world  ', u'that is ', u'you re no more in pursuit of happiness ', u'you re blissed out by your own nature  ', u'when you re not in pursuit of happiness ', u'you re no more a vested interest in the world ', u'you will do what is needed ', u'but when you re in pursuit of happiness  ', u' if i do this i will find happiness ', u'if i do that i will get fulfillment ', u'or if i get this i will get fulfillment   ', u'when you re in such a state ', u'knowingly or unknowingly ', u'you re a vested interest ', u'knowingly or unknowingly ', u'you will cause much harm ', u'people may not realize that right now ', u'generations later people will look back and say ', u' look at the things they did in the past ', u'but if you re joyful and blissful by your own nature ', u'your intelligence will function in a completely different way ', u'you will do just what is needed ', u'another thing is', u'you are free from the fear of suffering ', u'only and only when you re free of fear of suffering ', u'will you stride full stride in your life ', u'otherwise ', u'every step is a half a step  ', u' what will happen ', u'what will happen ', u'what will happen ', u' whatever happens  this is how i will be   ', u'if this assurance comes to you ', u'then you would explore your life in many  many ways', u"than you are doing  right now  isn't it ", u'this one thing must happen for every leader ', u'this is the reason why last twenty years we ve been focusing on the leadership in the world  ', u'political ', u'business ', u'bureaucratic leadership ', u'all kinds ', u'this is about twelve  thirteen years ago', u'someone very prominent person came to the yoga center', u'and they went through the inner engineering program', u'and they said ', u' sadhguru  this is fantastic ', u'but what about the nation ', u'so i told them ', u' see  i have a clear cut plan ', u'i have listed out 2000 people ', u'i m not talking about prime ministers ', u'chief ministers because they come and go ', u'you know  the life of a democratic leader may be five years or ten years at the most ', u'some may last a little longer ', u'but generally that s all it is ', u'but there are another set of leaders  ', u'business leaders ', u'bureaucratic leaders ', u'social leaders', u'who are there for a solid twenty five   thirty year span ', u'in many ways ', u'these are the people ', u'who ultimately are the legs for any political leadership ', u'they are the people who actually deliver the goods ', u'so i said ', u' see  i have a list of 2000 people ', u'you get me these 2000 people in the next four years ', u'you will see in the next eight to ten years', u'you will see a significant transformation in the country ', u'we ve been going at it ', u'nearly fourteen  fifteen years i think now ', u'i think we have touched about forty two to forty three percent of this leadership', u'and they re making a quiet difference  ', u'i m here with you for the same purpose  ', u' but sadhguru  tell me one thing', u'one of my closest friend s wife had a very bad back problem', u'and now she is doing yoga ', u'and it seems she will be able to avoid surgery ', u'and she will get cured hopefully by yoga ', u'how do we take this science ', u'which energizes the body ', u'to the youth of the country ', u' the youth of any nation has some level of volatility', u'and some level of confusion ', u'but right now', u'the youth in india in many ways are at crossroads ', u'they do not know culturally', u'whether they want to fall this way or that way ', u'usha has successfully you know ', u'straddled the two worlds ', u'look at her how she looks ', u'but she s a rock singer  okay  ', u'so others are all struggling how to', u'you know ', u'they don t know whether to get totally westernized or stay indian ', u'somebody says bharat ', u'somebody says india  you know ', u"it's a confusion for the youth ", u'the  youth means it is humanity in the making ', u'and terrible things have been happening in the country ', u'in our country so many things are happening ', u'in this ', u'what is happening to children and youth is of great concern', u'because it seems in the last one year ', u'1700 children', u'below sixteen years of age committed suicide in this country ', u'when children start committing suicide ', u'we need to understand', u'we re doing something fundamentally wrong ', u'something very fundamentally wrong ', u'when children below sixteen years of age commit suicide in such numbers', u'we need to understand ', u'with grave concern ', u'that fundamentals are not being handled properly ', u'i heard this number about four months ago ', u'then i told our people', u'this year for the yoga day', u'we must touch 10 000 schools ', u'we must teach yoga in 10 000 schools ', u'people balked ', u'but they ve gotten used to it this  these days  ', u'my aspirations ', u'10 000 looked like a bi  big number four months ago ', u'then i just traveled eight states', u'and met the chief ministers of every state', u'but all of them came with such enthusiasm', u'that today we have made mous ', u'with these eight states', u'and the ninth state is coming through now ', u'it is going to cross 30 000 schools  ', u'we', u'we have trained 45 600 teachers', u'who in turn will train three teachers in every school', u'and this is not a one day thing ', u'this is', u'will happen as a part of the school curriculum ', u'just twenty minutes a day ', u'a simple form of what is called as upa yoga ', u'upa yoga means it s sub yoga ', u'if you teach yoga ', u'there are certain parameters that you must maintain', u'because it doesn t matter how innocuous a yogic practice looks ', u'every one of them has a spiritual dimension to it ', u'simply the way you sit ', u'the way you breathe  it has ', u'without those dimensions  if you teach ', u'it would be irresponsible ', u'so we took this upa yoga and', u'which doesn t have a spiritual side to it ', u'which is purely for their physical and psychological well being ', u'it is of immense need in the country ', u'we are probably touching somewhere around seventeen to eighteen million children', u'between ten to sixteen years of age ', u'that s the age group we have chosen ', u'but this is still a drop in the ocean ', u'this is not a total solution ', u'this needs to happen on a much larger scale ', u'my commitment is', u'did all of you brush your teeth today ', u' yes ', u' those of you who re not saying anything  please ', u' yes ', u' you brushed your teeth today', u'because the tools for keeping your dental hygiene are with you ', u'suppose it was in the hands of the government', u'or with an organization ', u'the toothbrush is in my hands ', u'you have to come every day', u'and i will brush you  ', u'i m sure many of you would miss it', u'because the queue  you know ', u'now everybody has the tools of their dental hygiene ', u'similarly ', u'every human being should have the tools of self transformation in their hands ', u'it should not be in the hands of a guru ', u'or an organization ', u'or some other kind of edifice', u'that has been built  ', u'every human being must have access to this ', u'with this intent we are doing many things ', u'fortunately ', u'i consider myself ', u'you know  like ', u'i was speaking somewhere', u'and i said ', u' sadhguru  who is the greatest guru in the world ', u'i said   of course  me    ', u'mike tyson s posture ', u' this is me  i m the greatest guru ', u'they said ', u' what s happened to sadhguru ', u'i said see ', u'when a krishna came ', u'however graceful and fantastic he was ', u'if he spoke  the gentle being that he was ', u'if he spoke ', u'maybe fifty people heard him ', u'those behind did not hear ', u'when a gautama the buddha came ', u'he was little more  you know ', u'he didn t have the same aesthetic problems as krishna ', u'he was more committed towards his mission  ', u'so maybe he spoke little loudly ', u'hundred people heard ', u'today we have come to a world', u'where we can sit here and talk to a billion people if we want at once ', u'so when this kind of situation has come ', u'a time has come', u'where everybody should have access to it ', u'it should not be limited to organizations ', u'gurus ', u'scriptures ', u'this  that ', u'every human being ', u'as they know how to keep their mouth clean ', u'they must know how to keep themselves clean ', u'the necessary tools must be made available ', u'our commitment is just to offer the tools ', u'no philosophies ', u'no belief systems ', u'no ideologies ', u'no forming of one more new religion ', u'but every human being should have the tools', u'and they must know how to use it ', u'today it is possible ', u'never before this was possible ', u'today it is possible  ', u' very often a public display of simplicity is mistaken  for simplicity itself', u"and it's regarded as a virtue ", u'how does one actually impress upon people', u'that it is not a display of simplicity ', u'that is important ', u'but it is the simplicity of thought', u'and simplicity of virtue that is more important ', u' i would depreciate simplicity of thought ', u'i think we need a more sophisticated and complexity of thought ', u'why do we need simplicity of thought ', u'do we want to become earthworms  ', u'i know they re more eco friendly   but', u'that s not the idea of being human ', u'this entire simplicity business has come from very mediocre minds ', u'saints and sages of the past  if you look at them ', u'they lived in accordance to the times in which they lived ', u'someone   ', u'i have', u'whatever i do  i do it with a certain involvement and passion ', u'so i drive in a certain way ', u'so one journalist comes to me and asks ', u' yogis always walked across this country ', u'you are driving by yourself ', u'what kind of a yogi are you   ', u'i said ', u' you idiot ', u'thousand years ago ', u'not just yogis ', u'everybody was walking only  ', u'not just yogis ', u'everybody was walking  ', u'so he was also walking ', u'now if i walk and go ', u'you will say ', u' see  what a fool he is ', u'if i drive ', u'you will say', u' see  he s driving ', u'will i become more spiritual if i have', u'if i have a chauffeur driven car ', u'so right now  there is this thing', u'that spirituality is some kind of a disability', u'because if you say spiritu   i m spiritual ', u'first thing they will ask you is what are the things you cannot do  ', u'they will not ask you what are the things you can do  ', u'so  i took it upon myself', u'to confuse the hell out of people ', u'nobody can figure what i am ', u'i m many things at the same time ', u'i have driven in competitive racing ', u'i have', u'i m a licensed rotary wing pilot ', u'i m a licensed diver ', u'i m many  many things', u'because spirituality is empowerment ', u'it is not a disability ', u'the reason', u'why most people have rejected spirituality is', u'because some people projected the idea', u'if you dress badly ', u'if you eat badly ', u'and if you live badly ', u'you must be spiritual  ', u'this has to change ', u'this has to change ', u'everybody needs to understand', u'what you eat ', u'what you wear ', u'where you live is a question of your requirement', u'and your aesthetic ', u'how you are within yourself is your spirituality ', u'instead of fixing the interiority ', u'you re fixing the  paraphernalia  you know ', u'you re fixing your clothing ', u'so  if you just wear a small piece of cloth around your loins ', u'you will not become spiritual ', u'if that is the like', u'that is the way you like it ', u'you want to keep your life that simple ', u"it's up to you ", u'but unfortunately ', u'people are impressed by this ', u'no  this should go ', u'this has to go ', u'so i think in many ways ', u'in a very controversial way i ve set up an example for this  that', u'you know  donna  donna karan and me wanted to come out with a', u'i design clothes ', u'i', u'everything that i wear is designed by me', u'and i also design for a few other people  ', u'so i said', u'she looked at my clothes and said ', u' sadhguru  you re the best dressed man in the world ', u'i said   no  no  no ', u'she said   yes  really  i ve never seen anybody with your sense of color and texture and stuff ', u'we must design clothes together ', u'i said   okay ', u'i ll give one week ', u"one week let's design something ", u' but  she said   i don t know how to design men s clothes ', u"i said   what's the problem ", u'i will design women s clothes  ', u'there is more options and more creativity there ', u'well  i didn t get the time to do it but hope i ll do it someday  ', u'so this idea of simplicity has destroyed many things ', u'at certain times  certain people', u'somebody who lived in the jungle dressed in a certain way', u'but even they  when they came to the city ', u'in those days  whatever was formal they wore those things ', u'people s idea of spirituality or yogis and saints ', u'i think these are yogis who have fallen out of the calendar images ', u'okay  ', u' we re getting on in time ', u'this can go on ', u"but it's time to take questions from the audience ", u'we will take two questions ', u' please take the microphone', u'if you raise your hand ', u'the microphone will come to you ', u'yes ', u' namaskaram sadhguru ', u'speaking of gods and goddesses', u' i m sorry', u' speaking of gods and goddess ', u'kolkata is a place replete with kali and durga maa', u'celebrating slain of mahishasur ', u'you have also created mahishasur at linga bhairavi s feet ', u'what is the connection and spiritual significance of devi slaying the demon', u'and why under linga bhairavi also  thank you ', u' hey  we didn t talk about guts  gumption and gods ', u' we didn t ', u' she is bringing us to the gods ', u' yes', u' i want you to mentally gear yourself up for this ', u'i want you to understand this land ', u'this culture is a godless culture ', u'never before ever in this country', u'have we projected the god any time ', u'we always told you your life is your karma  ', u'that means your life is your making ', u'everything that you are is a consequence of what you do to yourself', u'either consciously or unconsciously ', u'if you do it consciously ', u'it ll turn out the way you want it ', u'if you do it unconsciously ', u'it ll turn out some other way', u'and you think something did it to you ', u"so  when we said it's your karma ", u'it meant that you are the maker of your life ', u'but gods and gods and gods', u'i m sorry ', u'goddesses also  ', u'there is a gender issue  ', u'we say that there are thirty three million gods and goddesses ', u'this thirty three million happened', u'when our population was thirty three million ', u'since then we ve gotten little shy of creating gods', u'because people from outside came without understanding', u'the science and technology of god making ', u'they said you are ', u'you know ', u'multiple gods you are worshipping ', u'that s not how it is ', u'we know there is only one god ', u'everybody made up their gods ', u'some have forgotten but we know ', u'that s a big difference ', u'making up the god does not mean just imagine something ', u"that is how it's happened in variety of cultures", u'but in this culture we evolved the technology of god making ', u'when i say technology of god making ', u'i don t know if this word is alive in bengal ', u'but in the south ', u'the deity is also referred to as a yantra ', u'is that there ', u'no ', u'yes or no ', u' yantra ', u' is the deity also referred to as a yantra ', u' well  in north india for sure ', u' it is ', u' it is ', u" okay  in south  it's very much alive ", u'you must understand  the word yantra means a machine', u'or a form that works for you ', u'why do we create machines ', u'why did we come up with a bicycle ', u'we can walk ', u'because we are capable of locomotion ', u'we walked for some time  ', u'it was not good enough ', u'so we came up with a bicycle to enhance our ability to', u'our locomotive capabilities ', u'we enhanced it further ', u'we made it into a motorcycle ', u'we made it into an airplane ', u'we made it into many  many things ', u'all this  only because we are capable of locomotion ', u'if we were made like trees ', u'we wouldn t have come up with bicycles ', u'right now because we can speak', u'we have come up with a microphone ', u'we have come up with a telephone ', u'we have come up with all kinds of phones ', u'because we can see ', u'we came up with a microscope ', u'a telescope and many kinds of scopes ', u'every machine that we have created', u'is only enhancement of the faculty that we already have ', u'we did not come up with any machine', u'which does something different from us ', u'it only does the same thing in a better way ', u'we can t  see till there   ', u'we have a telescope and we can see very far ', u'we can speak here but you wouldn t hear ', u'so we have a microphone ', u'now we are speaking to the entire hall ', u'so everything ', u'every machine is only an enhancement of our existing faculties ', u'similarly  as we have created machines ', u'we created subjective machines ', u'this is what we called as the deities or the murtis', u'or today being referred to as gods in english language ', u'these are machines which could do something for us that we ourselves cannot do ', u'there are any number of', u'innumerable examples where people have used their deities or murtis or yantras in ways', u'which have made them into incredible human beings ', u'one which is right now circulating around the world because of this movie   what  ', u'the man who knew infinity  whatever ', u'ramanujam you ve heard of  ', u'ramanujam just poured out mathematics ', u'unlearnt ', u'simply poured out ', u'people asked him ', u' where does this come from ', u'he says   my goddess  she just drops', u'she just bleeds mathematics ', u'the things that he wrote in early twentieth century', u'are still being figured today', u'and in 2010 they realized', u'some of the formulas that he built are actually describing the black holes  ', u'in early twentieth century ', u'there was no concept of black hole', u'but he created a mathematical backbone for black holes', u'which he did not know about ', u'nor did anybody know about ', u'he said ', u' my goddess just pours mathematics for me ', u'so like this ', u'these are subjective tools with which you can open up a certain window into existence ', u'i am a living example ', u'unlettered  ', u'happy being illiterate ', u'the only qualification i have is ', u'with great care i remained uneducated  ', u'yes ', u'no  no ', u'you think education is a difficult thing ', u'no ', u'remaining uneducated takes a lot more', u'because', u'from the first day you re born ', u'your parents  every other adult  teachers ', u'pandits  priests  mullahs ', u'all kinds of people ', u'everybody is busy teaching you something', u'that has not worked in their life  ', u'yes ', u'if somebody gives you any advice ', u'first look at their face   ', u'are they really more joyful than you  ', u'why i m saying this is ', u'if something has worked for somebody ', u"it should have made him into a really exuberant life  isn't it ", u'suppose somebody comes and gives you', u'your neighbor comes and says', u' i have a special manure for your mango tree ', u'you must look at his mango tree  ', u'how many fruits  ', u'yes or no ', u'before you apply that manure to your mango tree ', u'you must see in his mango tree how many fruits are there ', u'if his mango tree is laden with fruit unlike yours ', u'then yes ', u'you must take his manure', u'otherwise you should not ', u'all the teachers ', u'including the parents ', u'i m asking you  between you and your children ', u'who is more joyful ', u' children', u' then who should be a consultant for life  ', u'so  these are tools ', u'when i referred to  you know ', u'if i ', u'whenever i refer to dhyanalinga as a tool ', u'people get very upset ', u" sadhguru  it's more than our life ", u'don t call it a tool ', u"it's such a mundane  crude word ", u'then i tell them ', u' you do one thing ', u'you come to the yoga center ', u'i ll give you plumbing job ', u'no tools ', u'you can use your hands  your teeth  whatever you want ', u'three days  work without spanners ', u'winch   this  that  nothing  ', u'everything will be bleeding ', u'on the third day ', u'i will give you a spanner ', u'will you worship the spanner or no   ', u'you do not know the power of the tool ', u'as human beings we are who we are', u"only because of our ability to create and use tools  isn't it ", u'otherwise a colony of ants would dominate us ', u'believe me ', u'we know how to use tools ', u'that is what sets us apart ', u'so  we built subjective tools which ', u'today  are getting referred to as gods ', u'we appropriately called them as yantras', u'because these are machines which work for us ', u'so for this  we had a certain way to operate a certain machine ', u'how to access this particular machine   ', u'a particular sound pattern ', u'a particular form ', u'a particular process ', u'these processes unfortunately in many places might have gotten distorted ', u'but if a deity is alive ', u'if you know how to use it ', u'it can do incredible things for you ', u'this is not belief system ', u'this is not religion ', u'this is technology ', u'technology of another kind  ', u' we have a question from ravichandran ashwin on video ', u'can we take that ', u' okay ', u'is he going to spin me out or what ', u' hello  sadhguru ', u'i m basically a very ambitious person in life ', u'anything that i want to do i', u'i think i should excel in it ', u'and hence what happens is ', u'i get into a lot of conflicts in terms of other people ', u'i generally try and shun people out of my life as much as possible  ', u'when i seek excellence  there are always', u'these obstacles that come in between ', u'but what i want to understand is', u'the disturbance that this creates as a process it puts in our mind  heart ', u'so i would like to handle it much better ', u'and if there is a way that we can sort this disturbance out ', u'i would like to know how ', u' if you want to excel in something ', u'as i earlier said ', u'you think excellence also is your ambition ', u'ambition means you re tweaking your desire ', u'desire need not be tweaked ', u'your competence need to be tweaked ', u'tweaking the competence ', u'nobody can come in the way', u'because you re doing something with yourself ', u'when your competence reaches a certain level of excellence ', u'others will stand by and watch anyway ', u'when you spin them out ', u'even the batsman will stand and watch', u'his wickets fall ', u'because there is a certain excellence ', u'so excellence is not something that you do with the world  ', u'excellence the  is something that you do with yourself ', u'suppose you re managing large situations ', u'teams and organizations ', u'then it involves everybody ', u'when it involves everybody ', u'there is a certain aspect ', u'see  the problem is ', u'we are always either looking up to something', u'or looking down on something ', u'this is something we must understand ', u'this is one thing all of you should do  ', u'that is ', u'don t look up to anything ', u'don t look down on anything ', u'if you just bring this', u'this is not simple ', u'this is not as simple as it sounds', u'because the moment you say something is good ', u'you look up to it ', u'the moment you say something is bad ', u'you look down on it ', u'just bring this equanimity in you  ', u'you don t look up to something ', u'you don t look down on something ', u'you look at everything just the way it is ', u'only if you see life just the way it is ', u'can you conduct it to the best of your ability ', u'if you think something is good ', u'it gets exaggerated in a positive way ', u'if you think something is bad ', u'it gets exaggerated in a negative way ', u'the moment you exaggerate something in your mind ', u'you re not seeing things the way they are ', u'once you don t see things the way they are ', u'excellence will be of another world ', u'it will  you will never touch it ', u'so people are not in the way of your excellence ', u'nobody is ', u'it is just that you are treating excellence as an ambition ', u'no ', u'excellence is self transformation  ', u' there is a question from the rising pune super giants cricket team page ', u' this is a fixed question  ', u" it's", u"well  it's not a fixed question", u"but it's a", u' all right  ', u" it's a  it s a preset question ", u' all right ', u"what's the question ", u" i think it's", u' oh  they re coming on the video ', u'okay ', u" it's coming ", u' who is asking the question ', u'the coach', u'or the captain', u'or the bench ', u' no', u' what happened ', u' lokanetraji says no ', u'can we take one question from the audience ', u' anybody  please take the microphone ', u' sadhguru  i have a question ', u' where is \nwhere are you ', u' i am here  sadhguru ', u'this side ', u' where is here ', u'where \nwhich is this side ', u' this side  ', u'i m here sadhguru ', u' okay ', u' first of all  thank you for making it to kolkata ', u'we expect you more often in kolkata ', u'sadhguru  for centuries ', u'we have thought education is a solution  knowing will be doing ', u'now today we are living in a world where every information ', u'every knowledge  every profound thing is available at the click of a mouse ', u'but yet  problems have only got compounded ', u' oh  you re still on the mouse ', u'you re not on the phone ', u'hmm ', u' pardon ', u' you re still on the mouse  ', u'that s an ancient tool  ', u'you re not on your phone ', u' yeah  so all these years we have believed that ', u'you know if we know things  if we know what is right and you know ', u'life will get transformed ', u'today  the problem that', u'i personally face and i feel', u'feel so many people', u'i have done shambhavi ', u'now the question is ', u'every morning when i   rise ', u'it becomes a some kind of a challenge  you know ', u'whether i do it or i don t do it ', u'execution in our lives has become a challenge ', u'so  what is even  say ', u'you re touching the 30 000 schools and the children ', u'what will ensure that what the tools are ', u'whatever tools of transformation they learn ', u'that gets followed up in their life ', u'how', u'how does the execution part gets taken care of ', u'that s my question ', u'  now  with the children ', u"with the schoolchildren  it's", u'we are not teaching it to the children ', u'we are teaching it to the teachers', u'and it is going to become a part of their curriculum ', u'so they will do it anyway ', u'at least the five days in the school  it will happen ', u'the other two days we don t know ', u'we are trying to involve the parents ', u'if that happens  it ll happen at home also ', u'about you  every day struggling whether to do shambhavi or not ', u'i want you to understand', u'i invested my life  and my time ', u'and my energy to make this happen for you ', u'and now if you re not doing it ', u'you re not just wasting your life ', u'you re trying to waste my life ', u'i don t  i take that very seriously ', u'and that s not a good karma for you  ', u'so tomorrow morning  the thing is just this  ', u'if those first six months we told you that you set it up  ', u'this discipline  ', u'if you had done it  by now ', u'shambhavi would be a process that ll bliss you out every morning ', u'if something becomes a very sweet experience ', u'nobody has to tell you to do it ', u'it is only initially till you realize the nature of what it is ', u'you need some  force ', u'so that s why we asked you to take a commitment ', u'i m sure you didn t keep it up ', u'but now that you asked this question now ', u'next six months you must do it  okay ', u'otherwise i m coming  ', u'there are millions of people for whom they are looking forward to their shambhavi', u'every day', u'because that is the best twenty one minutes of their life ', u'it should become like that ', u'if something becomes beautiful ', u'then nobody has to tell you ', u' you must do it ', u'anyway you will do it ', u'it will become lot more than', u'anything that you have known', u'if you give yourself to it ', u'there are millions of people ', u'if they close their eyes in the morning ', u'tears of ecstasy are coming ', u'do they need to determine themselves they must do it ', u'they ll anyway do it ', u' friends ', u'i think in the interest of the schedule ', u'we must call this to an end ', u' last question ', u'one ', u'one', u' i m okay  it s ', u' okay ', u' hello  hello', u' somebody got the microphone ', u' pranam sadhguru ', u' can we take it from the lady there  then ', u' one question ', u' important question for me  please ', u'knowing who i am is not enough', u'because if you are', u' where are you ', u'where are you ', u'  if you', u' hello  ', u'where are you ', u' sadhguru  here ', u' here means where  ', u' balcony ', u' oh ', u' i think', u' balcony  here ', u'i ve raised my hand ', u'yeah ', u'what my question is  ', u'knowing oneself not intellectually but truly ', u'the i am ness  being ness is still not enough', u'because the mind still traps you', u'and enslaves you ', u' no  you must ask the question', u' though the frequency', u' you must ask the question and leave it ', u'if you ask the question and also give your own answer ', u'what to do  ', u' no  no  what i m saying is what to do ', u' what to do about what  ', u' no  what i m saying is even if one knows oneself', u'as the being ness and i am ness not intellectually but truly ', u'still it is not enough', u'because still the mind traps you', u'though the frequency becomes less ', u'one more  another thing  ', u'you claim to stop people from getting enlightened', u'because they may die ', u'it is so ordinary and obvious thing to know oneself ', u'then how  how can one die ', u'and how can one stop another person from getting enlightened ', u'thank you  sadhguru  ', u' i don t need to stop you   ', u'most people are doing a good job with themselves ', u'i don t have to stop them ', u"it's only a few whose", u'you must understand this ', u'the problem is ', u'too many books are printed telling you all these things  ', u'being ness and this ness and that ness  ', u'too much jargon ', u'nothing happens like this ', u'you must understand this  ', u'if in some way ', u'any one aspect ', u'if something is happening which is genuine  ', u'because your mind can deceive you in a million different ways  ', u'if something genuine is happening ', u'at least one aspect of your physicality you will transcend ', u'that is the test for you ', u'tonight just like that ', u'without drinking a mug of coffee or tea ', u'just like that ', u'simply without doing anything no party ', u'no nothing ', u'just sit up and see if you can just stay awake ', u'just like that  the entire night ', u'i m saying if something has happened within you ', u'at least one aspect of your physicality would be transcended ', u"it's not that forever you need not sleep ", u"just try one night if it's possible ", u'so  just one', u'or try not going to the bathroom for twenty four hours  ', u'anything  ', u'transcend something  let me see ', u'because if you have hit something beyond physical nature ', u'this is a clear thing that happens to you ', u'many things that you thought were impossible to go beyond ', u'suddenly they are behind you ', u'check it out  ', u' well friends ', u'i think all good things must end as must this ', u'for me ', u"it's been not only a privilege but a blessing ", u'i think', u'there is something to be learnt from every word that sadhguru says ', u'i think all of us are privileged ', u'happy', u'and blessed ', u'thank you  sadhguruji  ', u' i would  i would like to', u'i would like to use this opportunity to just say this   that ', u'it is  it is wonderful and truly heartening to see', u'that across the world ', u'today the business leadership is beginning to look at the inner dimension ', u'not entirely yet', u'but they re beginning to  all over ', u'every business school is interested  ', u'they', u'they re trying to hire me as their professors ', u'as a professor for a week ', u'ten days in a year which i m not able to do ', u'but every top business school wants a spiritual element', u'which is a very good sign', u'because what spiritual process means is just this  ', u'when your identification shifts beyond your physicality ', u'when your experience of life transcends physicality ', u'it is spiritual ', u"spiritual   it's the most malign word i know ", u'spirituality doesn t mean looking up  looking down ', u"it's about turning inward ", u'you have touched something which is beyond physicality ', u'the significance of this is just this  ', u'if you touch something beyond physical nature ', u'that means you have touched something which is boundless in nature ', u'you ve', u'you have left the world of boundaries behind you ', u'that s what it means ', u'those who are enabled', u'in terms of leadership  ', u'either political ', u'bureaucratic ', u'business  whatever  ', u'in whichever form  if you re in some state of leadership ', u'one thing that needs to happen is ', u'you must evolve yourself beyond the world of boundaries ', u'if you live in the world of boundaries', u'and get hugely empowered ', u'you re bound to create some kind of a conflict', u'which is destructive in nature ', u'particularly the business leadership today', u'because there was a time', u'when the religious leadership on the planet', u'was the most influential leadership', u'but then the military machines on the world', u'in the world built up ', u'then the military leaders became the most influential leaders ', u'but in the last hundred years ', u'the democratically elected leaders have become most powerful ', u'but a time is coming ', u'in the next fifteen to twenty five years  ', u'you will see the economic or

human intellect ', u'it is not deductions that we made out of our intellect ', u'this dimension comes from a profound inner experience ', u'where there is no right and wrong ', u'there is no up and down ', u'just seeing things the way they are ', u'and when we say dharma ', u'we are not talking about a religion ', u'as modern translators went about interpreting dharma as', u'hindu dharma or whatever ', u'another religion ', u'because they came from a mindset', u'that everybody has to belong to some segment of humanity ', u'they come from a mindset', u'where humanity has to be divided one way or the other', u'because they come from the surface intelligence of human nature', u'which we call as intellect ', u'unfortunately  the modern societies ', u'modern education systems have entirely dedicated themselves', u'to the human intellect ', u'completely ignoring other dimensions of intelligence', u'which definitely exist within us ', u'when you go by the intellect ', u'the nature of the intellect is always to dissect and divide', u'because intellect is essentially discriminatory in nature ', u'an intellect functions always with a certain identity ', u'if you have no identity ', u'you cannot use your intellect ', u'so with individual identities ', u'either of race  religion  nationality  caste  creed  gender ', u'when you apply your intellect ', u'it ll split the world into many pieces ', u'so the significance of what we are referring to as', u'the spirit of eastern wisdom is', u'it does not come from human intellect ', u'it comes from a deeper dimension of intelligence within us ', u'when i say a deeper dimension of intelligence ', u'a simplistic way of looking at it would be', u'whatever you had for lunch today ', u'if you had a piece of bread ', u'over the afternoon ', u'this bread is being transformed into a human being ', u'you definitely cannot do that with your intellect ', u'there s an intelligence here  ', u'which is capable of making a banana into a human being', u'you definitely cannot do that with your intellect ', u'a dimension of intelligence which is beyond thought process', u'thought  or the product of intellect ', u'is essentially always functioning', u'from a limited amount of data that we have gathered ', u'now  what we call as eastern wisdom', u'is not coming from a limited amount of data that we have gathered ', u'either from the books or our life experience ', u'but simply by enhancing our ability to perceive life', u'in ways that the five sense organs cannot function ', u'why i m talking about the five sense organs is ', u'all the data that you have ever gathered', u'which rests in so many aspects within you ', u'which is the food for the intellect ', u'comes from the five sense organs ', u'in the very nature of things ', u'sense organs cannot perceive the entirety of anything ', u'if you can see this part of my hand  ', u'you cannot see this part of my hand  ', u'this is the nature of sense perception ', u'even if you take a grain of sand ', u'if you see one part of it ', u'you cannot see the other face of it ', u'sense organs can only perceive in comparison ', u'if there is no comparison ', u'your senses are useless ', u'because there is darkness ', u'you know what is light ', u'otherwise you just would not know what is light ', u'if light was on all the time and there was no darkness ', u'you would not know what is light ', u'because there is silence  you know what is sound ', u'if there was no silence ', u'you would not have the idea of what is sound ', u'so always in comparison', u'it is like', u"let's say you re six feet tall ", u'now  you walk like a tall man ', u'you think like a tall man ', u'you feel like a tall man ', u'you are a tall man  ', u'you went to another society where everybody is eight feet tall  ', u'suddenly you walk like a short man ', u'think like a short man ', u'feel like a short man and you are a short man  ', u'so what you perceive in comparison is a distortion of reality ', u'it is not reality as it is ', u'so whatever we perceive in comparison is useful for our survival process', u'but if we want to know  know the nature of this existence ', u'sense organs are not sufficient instruments ', u'what is light for you is darkness for many other creatures ', u'you ever got into an argument with an owl  ', u'if you did  which is light  which is darkness ', u'where would it go  ', u'it would be endless argument ', u'who is right  you or the owl ', u'hmm ', u' both ', u' oh  if you re saying both   either you belong to the diplomatic corps ', u'or you have a successful marriage  ', u'you have learned to say   both  both  both  for everything  ', u'you re right ', u'well  that is the basis of all the problems on the planet  ', u' i m right and you are wrong   ', u'the fact of the matter is ', u'you are perceiving it as it is necessary for your survival ', u'the owl is perceiving it as it is necessary for his survival ', u'if survival is all you re seeking ', u'your five sense organs and intellect are sufficient instruments ', u'but if you want to know the nature of the existence ', u'if you want to know the fundamental laws or dharma which governs life ', u'the way it happens within us and around us ', u'then you need an inner perception', u'or another dimension of intelligence within you ', u'otherwise  you will only cut the world into pieces ', u'in the name of religions ', u'we have cut the world into  humanity into many pieces', u'because intellectually we have arrived at our own', u'conclusions or deductions ', u'which invariably is bound to divide', u'because intellect is essentially a knife which cuts ', u'it can only dissect ', u'by dissection  you can know certain things ', u'but if you really want to know someone that you love ', u'you don t dissect them  you embrace them  ', u'by dissection  you may know the kidney  liver  heart  stuff', u'but you will not know that being in any sense ', u'you will lose it completely ', u'so dissection is the way of the intellect', u'because it is a sharp instrument ', u'it has to cut it  cut open everything that s given to it ', u'but the east found another way ', u'out of profoundness of experience  you can know life ', u'by turning inward  you can know life ', u'when i say turning inward ', u'you must understand that essentially ', u'the five sense organs are always outward ', u"you can see what's around you", u'but you cannot roll your eyeballs inward and scan yourself ', u'you can hear this ', u'but so much activity in this body ', u'you cannot hear this ', u'if an ant crawls upon this hand  you can feel it ', u'so much blood flowing  you cannot feel it', u'because in the very nature of things', u'sense organs are outward bound ', u'the moment you dedicate yourself to your intellect ', u'you also get enslaved to the limitations of your five senses ', u'it is in this context ', u'the wisdom of the east is of tremendous significance to the world', u'because it has transcended this slavery to sense perception', u'and learned to perceive life in a completely different way ', u'what is this completely different way ', u'in english language ', u'if you say mind  it is just one word ', u'it is supposed to say everything ', u'in the yogic culture ', u'there are sixteen parts to the mind ', u'sixteen dimensions of human mind ', u'now  if i go into sixteen  it would take too much time ', u'so let me compress it into four  ', u'the four aspects of the mind are called', u'buddhi ', u'ahankara ', u'manas', u'and chitta ', u'buddhi means the intellect ', u'today  modern world is largely run by the intellect ', u'so  with this  we can do many things on the outside ', u'we can go on enhancing the comforts and conveniences of life ', u'we ve done very well', u'in terms of comforts and conveniences ', u'never before ', u'never ever before ', u'another generation of humanity ever knew', u'the kind of comforts and conveniences that we have today ', u'but at the same time ', u'we are whining like never before ', u'because as the comforts and convenience increase on the outside ', u'as there is less to complain about what is happening around you ', u'the emptiness of within echoes within you in a horrible way ', u'when you re fighting for survival ', u'when every day you are struggling to fix small things on the outside ', u'you will not realize this ', u'when outside is well settled ', u'that is when you will see how hollow life has become ', u'the biggest question in the world  ', u'you will see in the next few decades   is', u'what the hell are we doing here anyway ', u'because everything that needs to be fixed on the outside is done ', u'now what ', u'7 2 billion people on the planet', u"but right now  gradually  it's looming large", u'loneliness is one of the biggest problems ', u'dogs are being tortured to fulfill human loneliness  ', u'because as you dedicate yourself more and more to your intellect ', u'you will naturally become more and more lonely', u'because it keeps on dissecting and cutting life into various pieces for examination', u'and then you will see you yourself will be split up into many parts after some time ', u'if you go by the intellect hundred percent ', u'the next dimension of the mind is referred to as ahankara ', u'normally  people think it means ego ', u'no  it means identity ', u'you re identified with something ', u'the moment you re identified with something ', u'your intellect will work only to protect that identity ', u'no matter what  whichever way you think ', u'your ideas of which nation you belong to ', u'which race you belong to ', u'which culture you belong to ', u'which religion you belong to ', u'which gender you belong to ', u'the moment you get identified ', u'your intellect will work only to protect that identity ', u'so  it is a certain kind of prejudice ', u'well  you may say ', u' i m not prejudiced  i m very broad minded ', u"all right  it's a broad prejudice ", u'because people are willing to live and die for what they re identified with', u'because the nature of the intellect is', u'if you take away the identity ', u'it will not know what to do ', u'it needs a strong identity ', u'a strong sense of who i am ', u'if you ask   who am i ', u'your intellect will not function ', u'you must know who you are   ', u'a strong sense of belief that this is what i am ', u'that is when your intellect will function in a certain way ', u'this is like', u'intellect is like a sharp knife ', u'ahankara  or the identity  is the hand that holds it ', u'all the suffering on the planet', u'when was the last time when somebody stabbed you ', u'even though you re living in la   i am asking', u'when was the last time it happened ', u'never happened ', u'maybe when you were in school  somebody poked you with a pin  at the most', u'or they  even that did not happen ', u'they ignored you  ', u'or what i m saying is', u'how much suffering for a human being is actually coming from outside ', u'almost nothing ', u'rest is all self help ', u'because this  is a sharp knife given to you ', u'unsteady hand ', u"every day it's cutting itself ", u'you know  we were   we were trekking in nepal and tibet region', u'and i was in a tent ', u'someone was cutting an apple', u'and someone else  another person says ', u' this is a very sharp knife  be careful ', u'it irritates me because such an obvious thing ', u'you call it a knife only because it s sharp  ', u'if that damn thing is not sharp  why will i call it a knife  ', u"and if it's a child ", u'yes ', u'a full grown man  you don t tell him it s a sharp knife  ', u'i ignored it and i was working on something ', u'another two minutes  again it is said ', u" it's a very sharp knife  be careful ", u'i said   come on  leave him alone  ', u'he s a grown man  leave him alone  this is', u'he is not handling some super instrument ', u'a knife ', u'he should know how to handle a knife ', u" no  no  sadhguru  it's a very sharp knife   ", u'all right ', u'i get back to my work ', u'two minutes later  he cuts his hand  ', u'okay ', u'now  the problem is just this ', u'you ve been given a sharp knife ', u'unsteady hand ', u'every day cutting yourself ', u'you may call it stress ', u'you may call it anxiety ', u'you may call it fear ', u'you may call it misery ', u'you call it what you want ', u'all that s happening is your intellect is working against you ', u'that s all it is ', u'unless somebody is stabbing you from outside  that s a different issue ', u'we need to deal with that differently ', u'rest is all your own intelligence turning against you ', u'you may call it thousand different', u' no  no  my mother in law  my boss  my neighbor ', u'they are', u'they are not stabbing you ', u'they re only saying what they want to say ', u'it is you who is poking yourself because an unsteady hand  that s all ', u'but this intellect cannot function without a memory bank ', u'so what is called as manas is a silo of memory ', u'there are eight dimensions of memory ', u"let's not go into the detail but you know this much  ", u'there is a conscious memory ', u'today  they re recognizing a subconscious memory ', u'you know there is genetic memory ', u'you may not remember how your great great great grandfather looked like', u'but his nose is sitting on your face  ', u'a million years ago how your forefathers were ', u'even today your body remembers ', u'you may not remember here ', u'but your body remembers every aspect of it ', u'even the color of the skin it is remembering  not forgotten ', u'so there is genetic memory ', u'there is evolutionary memory ', u'like this  there s a profound dimension of memory in the body ', u'there are trillion times more memory in your body than in your mind ', u'so this is why this  is called as manomayakosha ', u'this is an entire manas  not in one place ', u'intellect may be up here ', u'but the manas spreads right through the system ', u'every cell in the body has a memory of its own ', u'has an intelligence of its own ', u'now the fourth dimension of intelligence is called chitta ', u'this is a dimension of intelligence which is unsullied by memory ', u'if you touch this dimension ', u'then the memory has no influence on you ', u'your genetic memory  your evolutionary memory ', u'your conscious memories  unconscious memory  subconscious memory ', u'whatever kinds of memories you have ', u'it has no influence on you ', u'or in other words  past cannot recycle itself through you ', u'see  right now  you take on this form because of a certain memory ', u"it's a certain software ", u"tch  if you eat  let's say you re a man and you eat a piece of bread ", u'this piece of bread turns into a man ', u'you are woman and you eat a piece of bread  the same piece of bread turns into a woman ', u'you give it to your dog  it turns into a dog ', u'very intelligent bread  ', u'it is just the memory that you carry ', u'here   there is a memory', u'which transforms everything the way it is ', u'so  this dimension of intelligence which is called as chitta ', u'which is untouched by any kind of memory ', u'just pure intelligence  is of significance', u"because it's beyond ", u'it is beyond your species ', u'it is beyond your form ', u'it s beyond your gender ', u"it's beyond your culture ", u"it's beyond every kind of influence which is essentially memory within you ", u'may be unconscious ', u'but it is memory playing out in so many ways ', u'as long as memory is playing out ', u'what it means is ', u'you re', u'in india  we say you are in a state of samsara ', u'samsara means  lot of people today understand as family  ', u'samsara doesn t mean family ', u'samsara means a cyclical life ', u'you are in cycles of life ', u'if you re in cycles or if you re going in circles ', u'what does it mean ', u'that means you re not getting anywhere  that s what it means ', u'a cycle is nice ', u'it gives you good exercise ', u'this is like running on a treadmill ', u"if you re seeking exercise  it's good ", u"but if you want to go somewhere  it's no good ", u'if you put your treadmill out here and keep running on it ', u'morning becomes evening ', u'fall becomes winter ', u'winter becomes summer ', u'everything will happen ', u'seasons will change ', u'scenery will change ', u'everything will happen ', u'only thing is you don t go anywhere ', u'this is what samsara means ', u'as long as you re functioning within the first three dimensions of intelligence ', u'you re in a cyclical mode ', u'it is all right to exercise yourself', u'but it s not good to go somewhere ', u'so if you want to transcend the samsara nature of who you are', u'or the cyclical nature of your existence ', u'then you touch the dimension of intelligence which is referred to as chitta ', u'why the so called eastern wisdom is of great significance ', u'why the dharma of the east is so significant and important is', u'because this comes from chitta ', u'this does not come from buddhi ', u'this does not come from manas ', u'this does not come from ahankara ', u'this comes from chitta', u'and only that which does not come from your individual identity or individual memory ', u'that can be truly universal ', u'so for this  we said ', u' this is sanathan dharm ', u'this does not mean hindu religion ', u'this is a very wrong conception ', u'sanathan dharm means the ultimate law of nature ', u'when we say nature  there is physical nature and there is an inner nature ', u'there are two dimensions  for this ', u'accordingly we made two dimensions of laws ', u'physical nature is a changing thing ', u"it's always in a process of change and a flux ", u'but the inner nature is a constant process ', u'so we made two dimensions of expression for this dharma', u'called shruthis and smrithis ', u'one is always to be updated for every generation ', u'otherwise two generations will keep on bickering and clashing  ', u'you have to update it ', u'another is eternal ', u'it s always there ', u"it's nobody s business to change it", u'because it cannot be changed because the fundamentals of life has not changed ', u'based on this  an entire wisdom arose', u'as to how to exist within you', u'and how to operate around you ', u'this happened in 1924 ', u'there was a bishop in the orthodox greek religion ', u'where  you know ', u'there is orthodox greek segment of christians ', u'they have a pope of their own in istanbul ', u'they believe they are the only true christians ', u'others are all riffraff according to them ', u'so he served this particular segment  which is very orthodox and rigid ', u'being in istanbul ', u'being on the silk route ', u'all kinds of stories of indian mysticism kept wafting across the bosporus ', u'so  he has a longing to go to india', u'and see a real yogi or a mystic ', u'but being a man of cloth ', u'he could not choose where to go and where not to go ', u'after he passed sixty years of age ', u'when he semi retired ', u'he got an opportunity and went to india', u'and came to southern india ', u'so his desire is to meet a real yogi ', u'not a book yogi ', u'not a studio yogi but a real one  ', u'so somebody directed him and said ', u' go up this hill  there in this kind of place  there will be one yogi ', u'so he went up ', u'well  he s not made for the mountains ', u'he went huffing and puffing up and then he found in front of a small cave ', u'a yogi was sitting  eyes closed  totally blissed out ', u'he went there and', u'he has been told that if you see a indian yogi ', u'you must prostrate ', u'well  he was not made for that ', u'but he somehow managed ', u'huffed and puffed and sat down ', u'hearing this commotion ', u'the yogi opened his eyes and smiled ', u'immediately  the bishop looked at him and said ', u' can i ask you a question ', u'the yogi said   by all means ', u'the bishop asked   what is life ', u'this is after sixty  ', u'you should have asked this question when you were eight  ', u'at least when you re sixteen   ', u'sixty ', u'but what to do ', u'better late than never  ', u'he asked ', u'then the yogi laughed and went into raptures ', u' oh life ', u'life is like the fragrance of jasmine upon gentle spring breeze   ', u'the bishop looked at him and said ', u' what ', u'life is like fragrance of jasmine upon gentle spring breeze ', u'our teacher told us ', u' life is like a thorn  ', u'once it gets into you  ', u'if you sit  it hurts ', u'if you stand  it hurts ', u'if you lie down  it hurts   ', u'what is this fragrance of jasmine upon gentle spring breeze ', u'so the yogi smiled and said ', u' well  that s his life   ', u'so this comes from the fundamental that ', u'when a human being clearly  experientially understands', u'that entire experience of human life is created from within ', u'never from outside ', u'right now  as you sit here  do you at least see me ', u'even if you re not listening to me  i m saying  ', u'can you use your hand and show where i am ', u'ah  no  no  you re getting it all wrong ', u'you know i m a mystic from south india  ', u'now this light is falling upon me ', u'reflecting  going through your lenses ', u'inverted image in the retina  you know the whole story ', u' yes ', u' where do you see me right now ', u'within yourself ', u'where do you hear me right now ', u'within yourself ', u'where have you seen the entire world ', u'within yourself ', u'have you ever experienced anything outside of yourself ', u'right now  someone next to you  if they touch you ', u'you think you re experiencing their hand ', u'no ', u'you re only experiencing the sensations in your hand ', u'in the very nature of things ', u'you cannot experience anything outside of yourself ', u'when everything ', u'when the entire experience of life is caused from within you ', u"at least it must happen the way you want it  isn't it  hmm ", u'the world will not happen the way you want it ', u'at least  the experience of living here  within you ', u'must happen the way you want it ', u'if  if  if your experience of life happened just the way you want it ', u'how would you keep yourself ', u'blissful or miserable ', u' blissful ', u' please  you must tell me  i m going to bless you  ', u'blissful or miserable ', u' blissful ', u' for yourself   definitely  highest level of pleasantness for yourself ', u'what you want for your neighbor may be debatable ', u"but you know what you want for yourself  isn't it ", u'now  blissfulness or pleasantness of life is not a goal by itself ', u'it is only when you re blissful by your own nature ', u'that means you determine the nature of your experience ', u'no matter what is the situation ', u'you determine the nature of your experience ', u'or in other words  you have no fear of suffering ', u'only and only when there is no fear of suffering ', u'will you walk full stride in this life ', u"otherwise it's always about", u' what will happen to me ', u'what will happen to me ', u'every step is a half a step ', u'now  this so called spirit of eastern wisdom comes from those beings', u'who walked full stride ', u'who determined the nature of their experience ', u'the outside never decided who they are ', u'so  they could walk full stride and explore the depths and dimensions of life', u'that others never dared to touch', u'because most of the humanity is only concerned about', u' what will happen to me ', u' what will happen to me  means what ', u' will i suffer    that s the question ', u'the first and foremost thing ', u'if you truly want to explore dimensions which we are referring to', u'as another dimension of wisdom or knowing  is', u'that first you must determine the nature of your experience ', u'you have no fear of suffering ', u'only then  truly exploring human consciousness becomes a reality ', u'touching dimensions of intelligence', u'which gives access to the entire universe becomes a possibility ', u'i m supposed to open up for questions  ', u"it's time you ask your questions please ", u' the population i work with', u'that are in the verge of homelessness or they are addicts', u'if i tell them that  it is your intellect ', u"and it's your perception ", u'and this doesn t exist  they will laugh at me', u'because it definitely exists ', u" they must because it's the dumbest thing to say  ", u' right ', u'so i wanted to know this spirituality that you teach ', u'the spirituality that many gurus teach ', u'how is it usable for someone that doesn t have food to eat', u'and is going to become homeless', u'and there is so many problems ', u'especially in america ', u'i mean how', u"of course i teach them resiliency  it's a different fact ", u'but every time i m going to open my mouth and use some of your teachings ', u'i have to step back  ', u' now the first problem is that you believe in the teachings because', u'this is the problem with the entire world  ', u'they have been cultured in some belief or the other ', u'this is what is significant about', u'what is referred to as sanathana dharma', u'or what is referred to as the indian way of looking at things is ', u'this is not a land of belief systems ', u'this is a land of seekers ', u'never ever were anybody encouraged to believe anything ', u'if you see anything that comes from that land ', u'you will see ', u'it is all about questions  ', u'never about a belief system ', u'if you enter a indian home ', u'in the same house ', u'five different people are worshiping twenty five different gods and goddesses', u'  they re still not made up their minds', u'which is  laughter', u'and they have no problem  they ll never fight about it ', u"because it's a land of seeking ", u'so first mistake you make is you believe what i say ', u'i am constantly reminding you ', u' don t believe a goddamn thing that anybody says', u'but don t be foolish enough to disbelieve it either ', u'all you have to do is experiment with it  ', u'does it work or doesn t work ', u"if it works  you keep it  otherwise rubbish it  what's the problem ", u'now  about somebody being hungry ', u'somebody being homeless ', u'somebody being in a war zones  ', u'all kinds of horrible things are happening on the planet ', u'i am not ignorant of it ', u'anyway  you said living in a temple', u'i am not living in a temple ', u'i am more of the world than you are ', u'every day ', u'i want you to understand ', u'i m running a volunteer organization', u'with over 4 000 full time volunteers', u'and over three million part time volunteers doing variety of work ', u'huge projects ', u'over a dozen businesses', u'and the spiritual movement  okay  ', u'now  i want you to understand ', u'more things are going wrong with my life on a daily basis than anybody s life  ', u'now when a man is hungry', u'if you try to tell him ', u' your intellect is the source of your problem    ', u"it's obscene ", u"it's obscene ", u"it's nothing short of that ", u'i never spoke to hungry people and said ', u' your intellect is the source of the problem ', u'i m talking to people who re bulging  in so many ways ', u'in their head and in their body  they re bulging  ', u'i m only talking to that segment of the population ', u'those who are not fed well ', u'i m doing social projects with them ', u'with nourishment ', u'education ', u'health ', u'all for free ', u'will i ever go and talk to a starved man in an indian village', u'and tell him ', u' your intellect is the basis of all your problems   ', u'what makes you think that i m that stupid   i', u'do i look like that  ', u'so you also don t do that  ', u'this is for you ', u'you need to understand this  there are million problems on the planet ', u'all these million problems are essentially because', u'those who are reasonably well have never cared to reach out and do', u'what needs to be done in the world ', u'in many ways  they re making sure those people don t get it ', u'yes ', u'in the year 2012 ', u'we have produced enough food for 18 2 billion people ', u'we had only 6 6 billion people in that year', u'but still  fifty percent of the population is malnourished', u'and hardly eaten anything ', u'this is not because there is no food ', u'because', u"this is because you and me have not cared  isn't it ", u'so ', u'is it true ', u'is it true nobody stabbed you in the last twenty five years ', u'yes ', u'but is it also true you re suffering various things of tension  stress  anxiety  this  that ', u'is it a product of your mind', u'or somebody else poking you from outside ', u'it is your reaction to the existential situation outside ', u'instead of doing what is needed ', u'what you see is', u'when you see something wrong happening', u'or when you see some suffering', u'or something comes your way ', u'you decide to poke yourself ', u'this is about incapacitating yourself ', u'instead of seeing when there is a problem ', u'you need empowerment ', u"not incapacitating yourself  isn't it ", u'i m talking about empowering you', u'so that your damn intelligence functions for you ', u'not against you ', u'the moment your intelligence is working against you ', u'no god in the universe is going to help you', u'and can help you ', u'yes ', u'if your intelligence has turned against you ', u'you are a finished case ', u'so i m saying  first let your intelligence work for you ', u'if it works for you ', u'there are many miraculous things that you can do', u'for all those people who have still not eaten properly ', u'for whom basic things have not been taken care of ', u'that s our business because', u'somehow we ve landed in a place', u'where you and me are at least eating well ', u'once we are in such a privilege ', u'we must use our intelligence to see what is the best thing we can do in the world ', u'not sit here and twist yourself out ', u'i m saying don t twist yourself out ', u'if you re joyful ', u'naturally you will do the best things you can do ', u'if i meet you when you re very happy ', u'will you be nice to me ', u' i ll always be nice to you ', u' no  no  no  ', u'i don t believe that ', u'when you re very happy  if i meet you  i m sure you re a wonderful person ', u'but when you re depressed  when you re unhappy  when you re frustrated ', u'if i meet you  you could be a nasty person ', u' yes ', u" this is true with every human being  isn't it ", u'so the first and foremost work that any human being has to do is', u'that you make this  into a pleasant piece of life', u'so that you naturally exude this pleasantness in every possible way ', u'if this  is feeling unpleasant', u'and you tell this one to be pleasant ', u'is it going to work ', u'we are trying to fix the stomach full people right now  ', u' it was a pleasure listening to you  unbelievable ', u'but my question is', u'what can i do so that i can acquire your skill of clarity ', u'honesty  ', u'and honestly  generally speaking ', u'very few people  you know  are like you are ', u'i m sure you have heard this before  ', u'so what makes you', u'what makes you so secure from within and be so candid ', u'honest ', u'truthful ', u'clarity of expression  ', u' i didn t know that s a popular question  ', u'when we say clarity ', u'that means  tch ', u"i want to tell you a joke but it's", u"it's a dirty joke so i thought i ll skip that one  ", u' go for it ', u' please tell ', u' no  no  i ll s  i ll come with something milder  you know  ', u'the problem with the human being right now  is this  ', u'we have created a world', u'we have created education systems', u'where we believe that', u'human beings are essentially all wrong', u'or the creation is all wrong', u'or the source of creation or the creator is all wrong', u'and you re going to fix it  ', u'this is a convoluted idea ', u'instead of paying attention to life ', u'we are coming up with philosophies and philosophies and philosophies ', u'philosophies are fantastic explanations to that which cannot be explained ', u'if you want to know life ', u"you must pay attention to life  isn't it ", u'right now  do you agree with me  madam ', u'that this human mechanism is the most sophisticated machine on the planet ', u' yes ', u' do you agree with me ', u'are you a doctor ', u' yes ', u' yes  ', u'so  this  is such a complex machine ', u'this  is the super  super computer  all right ', u'i m asking have you bothered to read the user s manual  ', u'if you understand how this  functions ', u'you would know how to use it ', u'even if you take a simple gadget like a phone ', u'the more you know about it  the better you can use it ', u"isn't it so ", u'you have definitely  coming from india ', u'you have definitely been bombarded with this thing about', u'realization', u'self realization ', u' yes ', u' let me put it in very simple terms ', u'what self realization means is', u'first of all  what the word realization means  ', u'realization is not an achievement ', u'it is not an accomplishment ', u'it is just realization ', u'that means something that s always here ', u'you just managed to see it now ', u'that means you were stupid all your life  ', u'just now you saw it  ', u'you did not invent something new ', u'you did not ramp yourself up to a mountain ', u'no ', u'you just saw the most obvious thing which was always here  ', u'you realized ', u'so ', u'realization means you realized how foolish you have been ', u'everything has been right here', u'and you didn t get it ', u'so there are many ways ', u'of course  most of you being from the indian origin ', u'i have not read this', u'i have to admit  i have never read the gita ', u'because it never occurred to me ', u'i m sorry  ', u'i know this is a shock  ', u'but you know  be', u'living in india ', u"bits and pieces of this are always floating around in the air and it's", u'you know many pieces of it', u'but i ve never really studied it in any sense ', u'so when  on a certain moment ', u'when arjuna asked ', u' what is the nature of this truth that you re talking about ', u'where is it ', u'so krishna laughed and said ', u' the highest truth about your life is at the tip of your nose ', u'now there are many schools of yoga intensely focusing on the tips of their noses', u' ', u'please try it for two minutes  you will get a headache  ', u'you will not get enlightened  ', u'what he is saying is  it is the most obvious thing ', u'it is the most obvious thing', u'but right now  the problem is', u'all the instruments of perception that you have are outward bound', u'but the seat of your experience is within you ', u'the fundamental seat of your experience is within you', u'but all the instruments of perception are outward bound ', u'so how should i do this ', u'you must understand', u'anything beyond survival  if it has to enter your life ', u'some striving is needed ', u"let's say ", u'as a little infant ', u'you were left in the jungle without human contact ', u'if something edible came in front of you ', u'would you first try your ears ', u'then nostrils ', u'and somehow by accident find your mouth ', u'is that so ', u"you would just know where to put it  isn't it ", u'so what i m saying is everything that is necessary for survival', u'is built into you ', u'it', u'you re born with it ', u'the five senses takes care of it ', u'but if you want to know something more ', u'you have to strive ', u'for example ', u'do you remember ', u'when you were three  four or five years of age ', u'you had to learn to write the alphabet ', u'that damn  a  how complicated it was', u'and they  on top it  there were two versions  ', u"you had to write it a hundred times to get it  isn't it ", u'but today  with your eyes closed ', u'you can write ', u'if that striving was not there ', u'today could you write ', u'today would you know language ', u'so  anything beyond survival needs striving ', u'without the needed striving  it won t happen ', u'there are ways to perceive the interiority of who you are', u'but unfortunately  there s been no striving ', u'right now  we made this technology into such a simple ', u'almost like a physical science ', u' a  plus  b  equals this or', u'two parts of hydrogen  one part of oxygen ', u'water will come ', u'if a great scientist puts it together  only water will come ', u'an idiot puts it together  only water will come ', u'so we made the entire yoga sutras like this ', u'that if you do this  this  and this ', u'this will happen to you ', u'that simple and all i m asking  generally from people is', u'about thirty  thirty to thirty two hours of focused time', u'to develop an instrument where they can turn inward ', u' ooof  thirty hours is too much   ', u'i m saying if you cannot dedicate', u'a little bit of time to know what this  is ', u'that means your existence must be truly worthless ', u'if this  is worthwhile ', u"you must pay attention to this   isn't it ", u'if you want to know life ', u"this  is life  isn't it ", u'when i say the word life ', u'maybe you re thinking about your profession ', u'your family ', u'your car ', u'your home ', u'no ', u'these are all accessories ', u"this  is life  isn't it so ", u'hello ', u' yes  ', u' but no attention has been paid ', u'your idea of fixing life is fixing all kinds of things ', u'this happened one day ', u'shankaran pillai was going home  ', u'no  i m not done  ', u'shankaran pillai was going home ', u'30 in the evening ', u'the rules at home  ', u'00 he must be home ', u'30 ', u'he thought   there is still time ', u'let me have a quick drink and go ', u'he just stepped into the local bar ', u'he had a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick drink  ', u'then he looked at the time   ', u'00 am ', u'tch ', u'you know  drinking people are like yogis ', u'they become timeless  ', u'there s a certain correlation  ', u"then it's late and he got off the bar stool and tried to walk ", u"it's such an unfair world ", u'a man is supposed to walk on a round planet ', u'as if that s not enough  it spins  ', u"you notice that the planet is round and it's spinning", u'only when you ve had a few drops more', u'or a few drops are missing between your two ears  ', u'either you re drunk or you have a vertigo ', u'then you notice the planet is round and spinning ', u"otherwise you think it's flat and you re going on fine  ", u'so with great difficulty  he was walking sideways', u'and trying to find his way home ', u'he was crossing a garden and he flipped over', u'and fell face down into a rose bush ', u'his face became a mess ', u'then he somehow reached home and you know ', u'these keyholes are so minute ', u'it took twenty minutes to find the keyhole ', u'then he found his way up to the bedroom', u'and then he went into the bathroom', u'and he looked at his face ', u'it was a real mess ', u'then he opened the medicine cabinet ', u'took out medicine ', u'plaster ', u'band aid ', u'fixed himself up and slowly crawled into the bed ', u'fortunately  the wife is a big sleeper  ', u'he slept ', u'morning eight o clock ', u'the wife ', u'took a bucketful of cold water and splashed it on him ', u' aahh    ', u'water boarded  he woke up ', u"he said   why  why  it's only a sunday ", u'she said ', u' you fool  again drinking  she s', u'he said   honey  six months ago  i promised you ', u'since then  i haven t touched a drop ', u'she grabbed him by the shirt', u'and took him into the bathroom and showed him  ', u'all the plaster was on the mirror  ', u'why', u'why people have lost their clarity ', u'why people have lost their clarity is only because of this  ', u'that if there is any suffering here  ', u'they think this one  should be fixed  ', u'if something else happens  that one should be fixed ', u'if something else happens  that one should be fixed  ', u'every day morning prayer means what ', u'trying to fix the god  ', u'yes ', u"you re trying to fix up the god  isn't it ", u'so day in and day out ', u'for everything that happens within you ', u'instead of fixing this one  ', u'you re trying to fix everything around you ', u'no wonder you will be confused', u'we ve fixed the planet sufficiently ', u'at least in this part of the world ', u'if you fix it any more  there ll be no planet left ', u'but are people bursting with ecstasy ', u'no ', u'so because', u'clarity has been lost simply because of this ', u'if you understand ', u'if life has to really become beautiful for you ', u'this one  has to be fixed ', u'if you understand this one thing ', u'clarity will dawn within you  ', u' i actually have a question on chitta ', u'how can we tap into chitta  which is', u'what you said ', u'memory with no effect and the ability to break the cycles ', u' right here  you want to do that  ', u'you can', u'you can take one fundamental step today ', u'that is i want you to', u'anyway you re  you ve already written down the question also ', u'you have the habit of writing things ', u'so you just sit down today before you go to bed ', u'write down what are all the different types of identities', u'that you have taken  ', u'starting from your body ', u'everything else ', u'just write it down and see', u'if you can create a little distance from these identifications ', u'just work on that ', u'that s the first step ', u'that you are not identified with anything ', u'you re just here ', u'throbbing as a piece of life ', u'not as this or that ', u'see', u' but what can i do  i am a young woman ', u'right now  yes ', u'when you sit here among people ', u'if you re just walking by yourself in the garden ', u'you don t really think you re a young woman ', u'or if you are that identified ', u"you can't help it even there ", u'if you just doze off a little bit ', u'you don t sleep as a young woman ', u"you just sleep simply as life  isn't it ", u'i m saying something so fundamental as your body and gender ', u'even that identity is only on the surface ', u'your caste  creed  religion  race  ', u'this is even more on the surface ', u'so i m saying ', u"you can't do it in the day right now but before you go to bed ", u'see if you can keep all your identities by the bedside table and sleep ', u'hmm ', u'to work in the world  you need an identity ', u'without identity  you cannot function in the world ', u'so before going to sleep ', u'take off all the identities ', u'keep it on your bedside table  ', u'morning it ll be there  it ll not go anywhere  ', u'leave it there and go to sleep ', u'you have started the journey ', u' i would like to hear guruji s turning point in life ', u'where he separated himself from his intellect', u'and his inner self ', u' do i look like someone who lost my intellect', u' ', u'i didn t think that i was coming out so dumb', u' ', u'this is  she s asking for a story ', u'do you want a story ', u' yes  ', u' okay  ', u'one must understand', u"it's a process that you set forth ", u'tch  this started happening to me when i was just', u'around four  four and a half years of age ', u'i suddenly realized one day that i don t know anything ', u'i don t know anything means', u'i don t know anything at all ', u'to such an extent ', u'if somebody gives me a glass of water ', u'i would not know what is water ', u'i know if i drink this water  it ll quench my thirst', u'and different ways of using it ', u'i know what to do with it but i don t know what it is ', u'well  actually if you look at it ', u'even today you don t know what it is ', u'it s the only substance present in the planet in all three different states ', u'three fourths of the planet is water ', u'nearly three fourths of your body is water ', u'if you re looking for life  you look for a drop of water ', u'there s lot of excitement  they found a few drops on the mars  ', u'i think people from california need to migrate  ', u'so  i m just staring at this glass of water for hours on end ', u'if i found a dry leaf  i m just looking at the leaf for five  six hours at a stretch ', u'if i sit up in my bed staring at the darkness ', u'the entire night i m sitting like this  staring ', u'my dear father  being a physician ', u'started thinking i need psychiatric evaluation  ', u' this boy is simply staring at something or the other ', u'unblinking he s staring ', u'he s lost it   ', u'my problem is i look at this one ', u'i still do not know this one ', u'there is no way i m able to shift my attention to another one ', u'so i', u'it just held my attention  i couldn t shift ', u'in this condition  they sent me to school ', u'and my mother said ', u' pay attention to the teachers ', u'i went and paid attention to the teachers   ', u'the kind of attention that they have never received in their life  ', u'and initially  i understood the words that they were speaking', u'and what they were trying to say ', u'after some time  i realized they re just making sounds ', u'i m making up the meanings in my head ', u'even now  as i speak  i m only making sounds ', u"you re making up the meanings  isn't it ", u'because language is a conspiracy between two people  ', u'if you have a conspiracy  what do you do ', u'the indians  you speak in your language  ', u'in india  we have this advantage ', u'we have 1 300 languages in the country ', u'we can have lots of conspiracies going ', u'because we ll speak in our own language ', u"actually  i m only makings sounds  isn't it ", u'you re making up the meanings ', u'so when i realized i m the one who making up all the meanings ', u'i stopped making the meanings ', u'then i just heard the sounds with full attention ', u'see  this is the problem with most people ', u'the moment they don t understand they think they need not pay attention ', u'what you do not understand needs more attention', u"than what you understand  isn't it", u'so  as i watched teacher after teacher coming in and making noises and noises and noises and going ', u'it became very amusing to me and a huge smile spread on my face ', u'they were not at all amused  ', u'my schooling went like this ', u'very consistent  ', u'because i remember this so well ', u'i don t know if you still have this', u'you still have those monthly tests and report cards that your parents have to sign', u'and your  you know ', u'your children have to get it to you  stuff like that ', u' yes ', u' so  monthly report cards come  i see in the school ', u'some children are strutting around because they are first or second ', u'some are sitting and crying because they re afraid to go home with their marks card ', u'never once in my entire school life did i ever open and see  ', u'the teachers gave me the card  i took and gave it to my father ', u'i thought this s a transaction between the two of them  ', u'i had nothing to do with this', u'because i was very consistent ', u'i always got six zeros ', u'because i always gave an empty paper ', u'if they insisted  i put my name on it ', u'otherwise i gave an empty paper  as a rule ', u'when the final exam came  i wrote something and went to the next class ', u'otherwise all my tests i got zero  zero  zero  zero', u'because', u'million things  you know ', u'i have a billion questions in my mind about everything ', u'there is nobody around who is capable of answering these questions', u'but they re trying to stuff something else into you', u'which i m not interested in ', u'so  school went like this ', u'this s about eight years ago  this school', u'where i studied nearly forty   forty five years ago ', u'they came to invite me for their one hundred and twenty fifth anniversary of the school  ', u'so the trustees  ', u'the third generation of trustees   came to invite me ', u'they said   you must come ', u'i said   see  i was not just a  not good  student  ', u'i was not even a student  why me  you know ', u'you call the brilliant students of your school ', u'why me ', u'they said    you know  our school has produced union ministers ', u'our school has produced cricketing stars ', u'our school has produced film stars ', u'you are the only mystic  you must come   ', u'i said   okay   ', u'so i went there to speak and ', u'and i went and stood up in the quadrangle  looked around  ', u'the same oppressive buildings  ', u'then i suddenly remembered this classroom ', u'i was about thirteen years of age ', u'one afternoon ', u'the teacher is trying to get a response for some question he s asked ', u'i hear the sounds but i don t hear the words ', u'after some time  i don t even hear the sounds ', u'i don t even see their forms ', u'i just see all kinds of things ', u'i know their past  present  and future', u'but i don t know what he s saying  ', u'i know his entire life better than him', u'but i don t know what he is saying ', u'and thirty five  forty minutes ', u'he desperately tried to get a response from me ', u'but those days  i am made like this  ', u'sometimes three days  four days i don t utter a word', u'not because i am in silence or something ', u'when you don t know anything  what do you say ', u'this  i do not know anything  has grown to such a size ', u"it's like  you know ", u'my mind is billions of questions  simply ', u'i have a question mark about everything in the universe', u'and not a single answer  ', u'so  then after thirty five  forty minutes  he got so frustrated ', u'he came and held me by the

the solution ', u'i want you to figure this out  ', u'hello ', u'what is the problem ', u'hmm ', u' there s really no problem  no solution actually', u'but there are so many problems  ', u' sadhguru  we don t know where you are living  ', u'where i am living  there are so many problems  ', u'i am also living among the kind of people that you re living with  ', u'yes ', u'same sort  ', u'the question is just what are you rooted into ', u'if your rooting is just your physical body ', u'some things are problems ', u'some things are solutions ', u'if you re rooted into a psychological framework ', u'everything is a problem  ', u'if you re rooted into the existence ', u'nothing is a problem ', u'nothing is a solution ', u'everything is an experience of life ', u'hmm ', u'everything is an experience ', u' if i die tomorrow ', u'that is also a very good experience ', u'we don t wish it tomorrow', u'but if it comes  that is also an experience ', u'hmm ', u'you don t like it ', u'whether you like it or not  it happens ', u'yes ', u' yes ', u' whether you like it or not  it happens ', u'not that we re wishing it tomorrow ', u'but if it happens tomorrow ', u'what the hell  ', u'we don t want it tomorrow ', u' still got miles to go before i sleep ', u'miles to go before i sleep    ', u'we don t know how many miles you will go  but', u'if you look at life in its full depth and dimension ', u'life is a certain amount of space ', u'if you look at life in a linear fashion ', u'life is a certain amount of time ', u'if you look at life from your psychological perspective ', u'life is a certain number of problems ', u'every day i m meeting all sorts of people ', u'thousands of them ', u'how many varieties of problems they have means it s unbelievable ', u'for sure for every solution there is a problem  ', u'birth is a problem ', u'death is a problem ', u'in between series of problems ', u'serial inventors of problems ', u'one cycle is ending  a new year is coming ', u'it s a choice that you have to make ', u'are you going to invest your thought and emotion and energy', u'in making up problems', u'or making up solutions ', u'or simply enjoying life for what it is ', u'it s a choice that one has to make ', u' oh  this is my resolution', u'i won t make any more problems  ', u'to make resolutions  first you need a constitution ', u'do you have a constitution ', u'hello ', u'you don t have a constitution ', u'no ', u'like a nation has a constitution ', u'a religion has a constitution too ', u'one advantage of the constitution of the nation is ', u'we can amend it periodically ', u'the constitution of the religions cannot be amended ', u'it s fixed  ', u'any change means violence will happen  ', u'if you suggest an amendment  they will kill you ', u'that is their amendment  ', u'the national constitution ', u'constitutions which make nations ', u'it is open to debate and amendment ', u'i m asking you ', u'you as a person ', u'do you have a constitution ', u'no  no  no  you have ', u'what you like ', u'what you don t like ', u' this s what i will do ', u'this s i won t do ', u'i m a morning person  i m a evening person  ', u'i m a whatsapp person  i m a e mail person ', u'i m a facebook person   ', u'there are constitutions   individual constitutions ', u'maybe not written down  but it s there  isn t it ', u'if you can pass a resolution  there must be a constitution ', u'if there is no constitution ', u'how do you pass a resolution about it ', u'so there is ', u'once you have a constitution  you are not a life ', u'you are an institution ', u'if you re living in an institution  you know what it means  ', u'it means you re a nutcase  ', u'yes ', u'no  no  no  not everybody ', u'either you re a nutcase or you re a spiritual aspirant  ', u'yes ', u'you are a seeker of sanity', u'or you re a seeker of liberation  ', u'one of these things means you live in a institution ', u' so  what resolution should i take for the new year ', u'all resolutions are impositions ', u'where there is no consciousness ', u'where there is no awareness to know life ', u'from the', u'from the aliveness of what it is ', u'you wanna fix it ', u'if you pass a resolution today ', u'in some way you re making sure', u'that you will not be aware for the next one year ', u'because awareness means a spontaneous response to life ', u'moment to moment ', u'as a  resolution means fixed  pre fixed ', u'if you pre fix your life ', u'whether it s done by you or done by somebody else ', u'if ', u'if your government passes a resolution  ', u'all of you must hang upside down', u'in india we would say a tamarind tree ', u'here  where shall we hang you from ', u'tch ', u'what s the famous tree from which they hang people ', u'no particular tree ', u'hmm ', u'where to find a oak tree   ', u'hmm ', u'where to find a big oak tree to hang from ', u'it s difficult to find them ', u'in india we say a tamarind tree for a particular reason  ', u'so let s say', u'your government passes a resolution that all of you must hang upside down from a tree ', u'whatever tree  ', u'we ll give you the choice of the tree  ', u'will you suffer this ', u'will you protest this ', u'will you rebel against it or no ', u'hmm ', u' yes', u' yes ', u'whether your government passes the resolution or you pass the resolution ', u'it s not any different ', u'you re trying to achieve something by force ', u'anything that you try to do by force', u'feels like you re hanging upside down ', u'yes or no ', u'you want to be like this but you want to do this ', u'you will feel like you re hanging upside down ', u'when you hang upside down ', u'you will feel like rebelling against it ', u'so naturally ', u'within three days your resolutions will become dissolutions  ', u'otherwise you suffer hanging upside down ', u'very few suffer the entire year ', u'some will dissolve this in three days ', u'some in three weeks ', u'some in three months ', u'but the very fact that they need one more resolution by the year end is', u'a proof that did not  did not last the year ', u'so there is no need to take any resolutions but', u'a resolution is made because you want to do something', u'that you naturally don t  not inclined towards ', u'but the simple thing is ', u'are you naturally inclined to be joyful or miserable ', u' joyful ', u' that was only five people  ', u'are you naturally inclined to be joyful or miserable ', u' joyful ', u' the little ones ', u' joyful ', u' so  you can consciously', u'you can make an attempt to be conscious', u'that joyful is my natural inclination ', u'so how joyful will i be in the coming year ', u'just keep accounts ', u'hmm ', u'see  lot of people who re doing business ', u'they think they re keeping accounts only for the sake of irs  ', u'no  no ', u'you keep accounts not for the sake of irs ', u'because if you do not keep accounts ', u'you do not know whether you re making profit or loss ', u'that s the idea of accounts  isn t it ', u'whether you re moving forward or backward ', u'to know this ', u'you need an account book ', u'why don t you keep an account book ', u'at the end of the day  just check ', u' am i little more joyful today than yesterday ', u'tch ', u'if you had done this since you were five years of age ', u'you would have been ecstatic by now ', u'profit side  ', u'became like this because you never kept accounts ', u'one day you checked when it became very acute ', u'then you see you are in a big loss  ', u'every day ', u'every month  just keep accounts ', u' am i becoming more joyful or less joyful ', u'there re only two things ', u'how joyful are you', u'and how much joy do you give to people around you ', u'this you can keep accounts ', u'hmm ', u'if you keep accounts of this ', u'people are keeping accounts of their money ', u'as if they re gonna carry it with them ', u'the real wealth of life is how joyful you are ', u'how wonderful is your experience of life ', u'joy is not a goal by itself', u'but it s a necessary ambiance for life ', u'if you don t set this one ambiance ', u'then whatever you have is just going waste ', u'hmm ', u'you may have health  that s going waste ', u'because  there are more people on this planet', u'who re healthy and miserable', u'than unhealthy and miserable ', u'at least if you re', u'at least if you re unhealthy  you got a good enough excuse', u'for your misery ', u'hmm ', u'you re healthy and miserable  there is no excuse ', u'i want you to just understand this ', u'it s just not smart to be miserable  ', u'hmm ', u'this happened', u'a lady was driving ', u'tch and then she had a flat tire ', u'she had never really done this  ', u'this changing tire business', u'but she read the instruction manual ', u'she put the jack and lifted up the car ', u'she undid the wheel ', u'with great difficulty she pulled out the heavy wheel from the boot', u'and was trying to fix it', u'and these four nuts that she had ', u'she had kept it in the hub cap', u'and with her high heels she was struggling', u'and she stepped on the hub cap', u'and all the four nuts flew in different directions ', u'so she put the new tire  but she had no nuts ', u'tch ', u'then she was cursing and wondering and miserable ', u'what the hell to do now ', u'and she was little nervous', u'because she was hearing all kinds of noises from a mental institution', u'which was across the street  ', u'then on the third floor ', u'there was a young man looking out of the window ', u'watching this lady ', u'then he said ', u' hey lady  look here ', u'all you need to do is ', u'take one one nut out of the three wheels', u'and put the three nuts on this ', u'you can drive to the gas station ', u'with three nuts you can drive  no problem ', u'she did that ', u'and she got the car down on the road ', u'then she looked up at him and said ', u' you re so smart  why are you here  ', u'he said   i may be nuts but i m not stupid   ', u'it s all right to be little crazy ', u'but you don t have to be stupid ', u'all the so called smart people who ve become  ', u'like they re practicing a posture for their grave   you know ', u'when i look at lot of people ', u'i think they re practicing  ', u'they re doing pretty well  ', u'but what they don t understand is ', u'it doesn t take practice ', u'when you die  it happens  ', u'yes ', u' yes ', u' do you think you need to practice ', u'no  ', u'because you can t improve death with practice', u'but you can improve life with practice ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' however you do life ', u'you can still do it better ', u'yes ', u' yes ', u' but death happens super efficiently for everybody ', u'you can t improve upon that ', u'you think you can improve ', u'no ', u'you don t have to practice your final posture right now  ', u'it ll come naturally  believe me ', u'it s not like life  there re no difficulties there ', u'it ll come very naturally ', u'you will do perfectly well in the grave  ', u'you don t have to have any doubt ', u'it doesn t need any preparation ', u'when you die  you will get it ', u'hmm ', u'but now with life ', u'there is so much to do and more ', u'how much ever you do ', u'there s something more to do about life  isn t it ', u'if you want to be at it ', u'the fundamental ambiance is that you re joyful ', u'otherwise  you will get this tremendously intelligent idiotic question  ', u' to be or not to be   ', u'yes ', u'intellectually seems very profound ', u'but it s the most idiotic question ', u'you don t have to decide not to be ', u'it will happen ', u'there were many idiots like you ', u'countless number of idiots like you on this planet who re gone ', u'they don t have to worry about to be or not to be now ', u'anyway they re not to be ', u'this is our time on this planet ', u'yes ', u' yes ', u' this is our time on this planet ', u'what are we going to do ', u'that s the question ', u'are we going to make this into an exuberant ', u'joyful ', u'wonderful planet ', u'or we going to make this into a miserable ', u'horrible planet ', u'this is our time ', u'we are free to do either way ', u'the choice is yours ', u'i won t tell you ', u' take a resolution that you will make this into a wonderful planet ', u'there is no such thing ', u'the natural inclination of life is for pleasantness ', u'if you choose to be very pleasant within yourself ', u'pleasant things will happen ', u'if you re feeling horrible within you ', u'and you try to do wonderful things ', u'then  i want you to understand  ', u'the worst tyrants on the planet ', u'those who topped the baddie list historically', u'i ll pick up the worst of the lot ', u'you take somebody like adolf hitler or benito mussolini ', u'they really believed', u'they are going to create a wonderful world ', u'you know this ', u'they had a dream of an ideal world ', u'when you have horrible things going within you', u'and you go at the world with very energetically ', u'what you will create is a horrendous reality ', u'before you touch the world ', u'if you want to clean somebody s face ', u'your hands must be clean  isn t it ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' your hands are not clean ', u'you try to touch this  ', u'this s not gonna work ', u'so before you touch the outside world ', u'this much you must do to with yourself that you are pleasant ', u'when you are pleasant ', u'whatever you touch will become pleasant ', u'you are unpleasant ', u'but you have good intentions ', u'it is no good ', u'i want you to understand ', u'right now in the world ', u'one situation that is happening in certain parts of the world ', u'which almost everybody in the world sees', u'as the most horrible things that can happen ', u'they believe they re creating god s own kingdom ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' they one hundred percent believe ', u'you may question their intelligence ', u'you cannot question their integrity', u'because they re willing to die for it ', u'when a man is willing to die for something ', u'you cannot question his integrity  isn t it ', u'you can question his intelligence and judgment ', u'but you cannot question his integrity', u'because when i stake my life ', u'you must know i mean it   isn t it ', u'i m not playing fool with it ', u'it means more to me than my life ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' i want you to know  you have anger and hatred going within you', u'but you want to create a wonderful world  ', u'what happens ', u'the consequence of that is a horrendous reality ', u'it s not by intention that the world will change ', u'it is by your consciousness that the world will change ', u'how you are within yourself ', u'if we don t fix this one thing ', u'we will have intentions and intentions ', u'the worst things have happened on the planet with good intentions ', u'not with bad intentions ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' the most horrendous things have happened with very good intentions ', u'so what intention you have is not important ', u'what is your inner nature ', u'this is important ', u'every action that humanbeings are doing in their life', u'knowingly or unknowingly', u'is in pursuit of their well being ', u'and you know you feel well only when you are joyful', u'hello', u'yes ', u"you feel really well only when you are joyful isn't it ", u'or in other words ', u'every single action that human beings perform', u'is in pursuit of their happiness or joy ', u'if they were joyful by their own nature ', u'every action that you perform would become conscious', u'instead of being compulsive  isn t it ', u'this is all you have to do to yourself ', u'this year ', u'the coming year ', u'and the coming  coming year and for the rest of your life ', u'you just have to keep accounts ', u'from yesterday to today ', u'am i little more joyful ', u'am i ', u'you don t even have to worry about giving joy ', u'if you re joyful  you will spread joy ', u'yes ', u'will you keep accounts  i m asking ', u' yes', u' or shall i set irs upon you  ', u'do you need enforcement  ', u'most societies have been run for a long time by enforcement ', u'so if there s nobody to enforce   ', u'no ', u'that s not what happens ', u'if there is nobody to enforce anything ', u'you become joyful  isn t it  ', u'i want you to understand this  ', u'the different between a resolution', u'and moving towards the natural inclination of life ', u'if there is nobody enforcing anything upon you ', u'do you become miserable or joyful ', u' joyful ', u' so  you don t have to enforce any resolutions upon yourself ', u'just little tools to make sure that you don t sink ', u'just keeping accounts ', u'daily ', u'every day before you go to bed ', u'you must check', u'whether you re little more joyful today than yesterday  okay ', u'if you keep this up ', u'by the time you re thirty ', u'you will be ecstatic  ', u'when i was  ', u'when i was just twenty five ', u'tch ', u'i simply sat down with my eyes closed ', u'every cell in my body was dripping ecstasy ', u'nameless ecstasies ', u'then i realized this is it ', u'nothing to be done ', u'if you don t mess with your mind ', u'you re ecstatic ', u'the fool that i was  i made a plan  ', u'in two and a half to three years  time ', u'i m going to make the entire world ecstatic', u'because there s nothing to do ', u'if you simply sit here   you know ', u'thirty five years   ', u'i have not lost it ', u'a few people have gotten it ', u'yes ', u'quite a few people have gotten it ', u'but still not the world  ', u'making some estimates and ', u'on an average ', u'in the last three years  time', u'we should be touching nearly hundred million people a year ', u'but still that s not the world  ', u'no  no  no don t  don t ', u'don t enjoy my failures  ', u'my idea of the world is 7 3 billion people ', u'tch', u'hundred million is not a success ', u'it looks like i m destined to die a failure', u'but i ll die a blissful failure', u'because me being blissful is not dependent upon the results of my actions', u' ', u'my actions are rooted in my blissfulness ', u'this is how life needs to be conducted ', u'that your actions are rooted in your joyfulness and blissfulness ', u'that joy is not a result of something that you do ', u'the moment it is a result of something that you do ', u'it will fly away in no time', u'because our actions in the world ', u'not always are they successful ', u'hmm ', u'however well you do it ', u'yes or no ', u'however well you do it ', u'not always are they successful ', u'our actions are subject to various realities ', u'many forces have to come together for the success of any action ', u'not always they will fall together ', u'so if your joy ', u'if your way of being is enslaved to the success of your activity ', u'then you being joyful is a very remote possibility ', u'and above all ', u'what will happen is ', u'when you perform actions ', u'if they don t succeed ', u'if you re going to become miserable', u'after a couple of burns ', u'then you will shrink ', u'you will see how to restrict your life to minimal activity so that', u'you will enjoy maximum success ', u'if you cripple yourself  you know ', u'if you cripple yourself ', u'you can participate in a race with people ', u'suppose you have only one leg ', u'then you participate in a race', u'with somebody who does not have both the legs', u'and of course you win ', u'this is what most people are trying to do ', u'the moment there is fear of suffering ', u'of failure ', u'what you will do is cripple yourself ', u'restrict your activity ', u'only when failure doesn t matter ', u'that you can go through your failure blissfully ', u'you will do everything that you can do ', u'who cares whether it happens or not ', u'we will do it and we ll do it well ', u'if it happens  it s great ', u'if it doesn t happen  it s very great', u'because we can do it all over again  ', u'joy is not a consequence of life or activity of life ', u'joy is a natural ambiance which is necessary', u'if you have to ', u'tomorrow morning if you have to wake up', u'and want to do something ', u'you no  you need to have some joy in you  ', u'otherwise  to be or not to be   ', u'will it come or not ', u'suppose you wake up and you ', u'tomorrow morning you re bereft of joy ', u'nothing in you ', u'you ll wonder   why am i here ', u'yes or no ', u'one day  one twenty four hours completely joyless ', u'will you wonder ', u' what the hell i m doing here ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' because this is the nature of life ', u'if this life has to blossom ', u'it needs the ambiance of joy ', u'so  we have given you the tools  to live joyfully ', u'you must keep accounts ', u'hmm ', u' yes ', u'  yes  ', u'i got it  ', u'before they serve food and music is ready and the party is ready ', u'i don t want to take any more time ', u"if there is a question that you can't go into the new year", u'without being answered ', u'if there is such a question   okay ', u'not that you must ask a question ', u'if there is such a question  okay ', u'no ', u'it works only if you speak  ', u' namaskaram sadhguru ', u' mhmm  ', u' i have thousands of burning questions ', u'but i thank you immensely for giving me this opportunity to ask one question ', u'how do i get rid of some unconscious bad habits in my life ', u'when i see that i have overcome some of those bad habits ', u'i see that it comes back again in my life ', u'how do i just totally get rid of this and become free out of it', u' see  you must understand that  please', u'there is no such thing as good habit and bad habit ', u'all habits are bad  ', u'because habit means you re unconscious ', u'you think only bad habits are unconscious ', u'no ', u'even the so called good habits ', u'habit means you have learned to function in an automated way ', u'that means you don t do things consciously ', u'for example ', u'is brushing your teeth in the morning', u'a good habit or a bad habit  ', u'even you ', u'i thought you would be free from a habit  ', u'there are two ways of brushing your teeth ', u'because you ve been regimented to brush your teeth ', u'you get up and ffff  ', u'or because you wake up ', u'you re very sensitive ', u'if you open your mouth ', u'you re conscious enough ', u'most of the time ', u'you re not conscious enough ', u'only other people know  ', u'this is a very strange thing ', u'there is the apparatus ', u'the olfactory apparatus ', u'which smell  which have a sense of smell  right here  ', u'above your mouth  ', u'but you don t get it ', u'others get it five feet away  ', u"that means you re unconscious  isn't it ", u'yes ', u' yes ', u' if you re conscious you would still brush your teeth ', u'till you come to such a place ', u'when you open your mouth in the morning', u'it smells like fragrance  you become like a flower ', u'till that happens ', u'you must consciously brush  ', u'if you consciously brush ', u'on different days', u'or different mornings', u'it may need different length', u'or different amount of brushing ', u'not every day  brushing is same requirement ', u'but because you re regimented ', u' three minutes  i must wear my teeth out  ', u'if you were conscious ', u'on a particular day you would brush as it is necessary for that day ', u'that s how it should be ', u'on a particular day ', u'you would eat as it is necessary for the body ', u'you would sleep as it is necessary for the body ', u'you would do everything consciously ', u"but now  it's a habit ", u'everything is a habit ', u'what time you should go to bed ', u'what time you should wake up ', u'what you should eat ', u'what you should not eat  ', u'everything by prescription ', u'this is called slavery ', u'your doctor tells you', u'or your slave master tells you what you should eat today ', u"i don t see what's the difference ", u'why is it that you do not know', u'what this body needs today ', u'because no consciousness ', u'everything by regimentation ', u'by habit ', u"habit is regimentation  isn't it ", u"it's only by regimentation you become habitual ", u'so in this  you have also identified something as good habit', u'and something as bad habit ', u'what to do ', u'is there something called as bad unconsciousness', u'and good unconsciousness ', u'that s what you re saying ', u'when you say   i have a good habit ', u'you re saying   i m unconscious in a nice way   ', u"it's like   saying ", u' i m dead in a nice way   ', u'because the fundamental difference', u'between being alive and being dead is', u'being conscious and being totally unconscious ', u'being partially unconscious is being partially dead ', u'as i earlier told you ', u'you re trying to practice the posture ', u'and the state of what it means to be dead ', u'do not fix any kind of habit ', u'just see', u'see  the idea of withdrawing into retreats ', u'coming to a spiritual space is just this  ', u'to find space where you can do everything consciously ', u'when you were in a race ', u'you could not be conscious ', u'you got mad', u'and you somehow fixed some habits', u'through which you managed to go through your daily office routine ', u'when you come to a spiritual space ', u'this is what you re supposed to do  ', u'that you watch what is the requirement of your body ', u'what is the requirement of your mind ', u'what is the requirement of your emotion ', u'what is the requirement of your energy ', u'what does this life  need ', u'what does it naturally long for ', u'to consciously watch this ', u'once you consciously know that this is what it is longing for ', u'then there is no two ways about it ', u'otherwise  you think you re on the spiritual path because of me ', u'that s a crime against me  ', u'yes  ', u'if you re unconscious  it s a crime against yourself ', u'but you re doing something that you think is spiritual', u'because of me ', u'that s a crime against me ', u'tch ', u'you better do crime against yourself  not against me  ', u'so  how do i get rid of habits ', u'you don t have to get rid of habits ', u'it is like', u'what you re asking is ', u' how do i get rid of my unconsciousness ', u'when you use the word  un ', u'we are suggesting a non existence ', u"not an existence  isn't it ", u'consciousness is ', u'when consciousness is not there ', u'that is called un consciousness ', u'how to get rid of something that does not exist ', u'i m saying you re playing a trick with yourself ', u"it's like ", u'suppose this  this hall is dark ', u'how to get rid of this darkness ', u'kick it out ', u'hmm ', u'all of you together  i m sure you can kick out of the darkness ', u'you will get into an insane effort ', u'you ve been on it ', u'hmm ', u'this insane effort to get rid of unconsciousness ', u'no ', u'to get rid of darkness  you just have to light it up ', u'if you light it up ', u'darkness is gone', u'because darkness is not an existence by itself ', u"it's just the absence of light ", u'similarly  unconsciousness is not an existence of itself ', u'it is just absence of consciousness ', u'if you become conscious ', u'do you have to fight with unconscious ', u'hmm ', u'if you re conscious ', u'do you have to fight with unconscious habits ', u' no ', u' no  so you need to work on consciousness  to become conscious ', u' oh  what should i do ', u'you should not do unconscious things  ', u'because the essence of life is being conscious ', u"you know that you re alive only because you re reasonably conscious  isn't it ", u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' you re fast asleep ', u'do you know you re dead or alive ', u'do you know ', u' no ', u' no ', u'why  because you re not conscious ', u'when you re not conscious ', u"you do not even know whether you re dead or alive  isn't it ", u'now you know that you re alive', u'because you re somewhat conscious ', u'now  we just have to raise the wick a little bit to become more conscious ', u'that s what we re working on ', u'there are many things  which has gathered inertia ', u'your physical body', u'30 drum in the morning ', u'your mind has got into its own habitual patterns', u'that s why me torturing you with all this ', u'your energies have followed the requirement of body and mind', u'and they ve gotten into their own patterns  ', u'that is why the sadhana ', u'the idea is to break the cycles of unconsciousness and become conscious ', u'when you become conscious ', u'it looks like you re in unknown terrain ', u'suddenly everything seems to be difficult ', u'when you were going habitually  it looked like everything was easy but', u'see  when i ', u'when i went into the coimbatore prison', u'no ', u'i went there unqualified  you know  ', u'when i went there to conduct a program  ', u'almost twenty five  twenty four  twenty five years ago ', u'i just observed  ', u'this is something a whole lot of people are seeking in their life ', u'prison life ', u'because this is a place where somebody always opens the doors for you', u'and they close it for you ', u'they turn off the lights for you ', u'they do everything for you ', u'you don t have to do anything   really ', u'food comes bang on time   always ', u'by the second  i m telling you ', u'tun means food is ready ', u'everything is great in this prison ', u'i thought this is a great place ', u"only thing is it's enforced ", u'but this is what a whole lot of people are seeking', u'systems in their life ', u'yes ', u'when it is done to you  you will suffer it  i m telling you  ', u'when it is done to you  you ll suffer it ', u'actually  for a whole lot of people ', u'prison life is far more', u'it is far more organized  what they dream of in their life ', u"it's far more efficient ", u'far more nutritious ', u'and most of them are very fit and healthy ', u'but if you enter the prison ', u'there is suffering in the air ', u'not once   i have been there hundreds of times to various prisons  ', u'not once have i stepped out of the prison without tears in my eyes because', u'there is suffering in the air ', u'the pain in the air is unbearable ', u'because one thing that a human being suffers most is lack of freedom  ', u'not lack of comfort ', u'not lack of wealth ', u'not lack of this and that ', u'once freedom is taken away ', u'a human being suffers immensely ', u'everything is correct ', u'prison life is far more comfortable than going to work and coming back ', u'getting stuck in the traffic ', u'going through all these problems ', u'you are a state guest  you know  ', u'really ', u'if you re looking for a comfortable ', u'no surprises kind of life ', u'if you suffer every little thing  sh', u'everything shocks you ', u'everything makes you go through stress and tension ', u'prison life is perfect  ', u'everything is in order ', u'no surprises ', u'everything is just right ', u'even the menu is written down  ', u"next seven days  what's the menu ", u"it's there and it goes by that ", u'nothing more  nothing more  nothing less ', u'one bean more means somebody will be taken to task  ', u'everything is correct ', u'those who are looking for a correct life ', u'prison is the best place  ', u'but a human being will suffer immensely when everything is correct ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' everything is correct but no freedom  ', u'people will suffer this immensely ', u'so  you need to understand ', u'habit means you have caused a little prison of your own', u'and you will suffer this after some time ', u'initially  it looks like efficiency ', u'after some time ', u'it is imprisonment ', u"prison is in many ways an epitome of efficiency  isn't it ", u'but efficiency is not what this life  is looking for ', u'this life  is looking for expansion ', u'this life  wants the freedom to expand  always ', u'i was talking to one of this management specialists from america ', u'a very well known man  ', u'let me not mention the names ', u'so  he was propounding all his management principles ', u'which if', u'which looked like a prison cell to me  ', u'bringing order to everything ', u"so that it's efficient ", u'see  there are two ways of looking at this ', u'there is a manicured garden  which looks very perfect ', u'there is forest  which looks like chaos ', u'but the manicured garden ', u'if you don t manage it for one month  it s finished ', u'there s no garden left ', u'a forest has managed itself for a million years', u'and still going on ', u'which is more efficient ', u'which is more orderly ', u' forest ', u' forest is far more orderly and far more efficient ', u'but it is not fitting into your logical framework  that s all ', u'this is what enlightenment means ', u'that from being a manicured garden ', u'you become a forest because', u'it sustains upon itself ', u'it doesn t need anything from outside ', u'nobody need to water it ', u'nobody need to manure it ', u'nobody need to come and trim it ', u'everything happens within itself ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' if you leave it for a million years it ll still be there ', u'only if you meddle with it  it may go away ', u'otherwise  it will sustain itself because it is an efficiency of chaos ', u'we call something chaos not because it is inefficient ', u'we call something chaos because it doesn t fit in to our logical framework ', u'so habit means you have become a slave of your own logic', u'and after some time', u'the moment you form a habit ', u"it is unconscious  isn't it ", u'so  what you need to get rid of is not habits ', u'you have to become conscious ', u'if you become more conscious and you re not unconscious ', u'then there is no such thing as habit ', u"you will do what's right for you now ", u'so  nine hundred and ninety nine questions ', u'please live with it for 2017  ', u'all the best ', u' namaskaram sadhguru ', u'thank you so much for this

getting to hug you ', u'it was amazing  ', u' hmm  what is that ', u' the kids getting to hug you was amazing  you know ', u'so it s okay ', u' but you don t have a sweet poem like her  ', u'oh  when you said the book  you know i m supposed to finish this book before 3rd of january ', u'so i m working on that book ', u'when you said   the book   ', u'i was just thinking book  book  book', u'because this book is bothering me for last few days ', u'i m supposed to complete it by 3rd january  ', u'we re writing a book on adiyogi ', u'i m to give it to the publisher by 3rd january and ', u'so that s the book on my mind ', u'you re talking about the old book  ', u'old book ', u'okay  ', u'the practice that is taught in the inner engineering program needs twenty one minutes ', u'you need to sit in one place and do it ', u'it is of a different nature ', u'it is ', u'it is a process which can change ', u'to start with ', u'the chemistry of your system ', u'many of you have experienced this ', u'after a few months of practice ', u'if you look back and see ', u'all those little little things which were so significant', u'don t seem to bother you anymore ', u'they re just gone ', u'simply because the chemistry has changed ', u'you know when chemistry changes  things change  ', u'in whatever way you have known it ', u'but there are other dimensions to human chemistry', u'that instead of being a volatile reactive chemistry ', u'can become a very self contained chemistry', u'which is pleasant and on ', u'the practices in the book are not', u'sitting down and doing practices ', u'you could be doing it anywhere ', u'you could be driving ', u'you could be working in your office ', u'you could be walking on the street', u'and still be doing it ', u'they re of that nature ', u'or in other words  the practices in the book are', u'just to bring a certain amount of consciousness ', u'the book did not have these practices to start with ', u'but when i travelled around in america ', u'everybody was talking about being mindful  ', u'then i saw ', u'by being mindful what they will do to themselves ', u'my entire work is to bring you to a certain sense of abandon', u'that you can be here like you re not here ', u'if you sit here ', u'you don t even know whether your body is here ', u'if you sit like this ', u'first thing is you don t have a gender ', u'you don t even have a body ', u'so where is the question of a gender ', u'if you simply sit like this ', u'there is no time for you ', u'just look at this ', u'only because you have a body ', u'your body is keeping time ', u'hmm ', u'your legs are telling you how long you ve been sitting ', u'yes or no  ', u'hmm ', u' yes ', u' suppose you had no legs ', u'you would have no sense of time ', u'if you had no back ', u'no sense of time at all ', u'if you had no body  no time at all  isn t it ', u'your body is keeping time from womb to tomb it is keeping time ', u'from bathroom break to bathroom break it is keeping time ', u'from wakeup to sleep it is keeping time ', u'yes or no ', u' yes ', u' once it s time  it ll do aaaaa  ', u'you don t have to look at the watch ', u'once a certain time is up ', u'your body will do aaaaa ', u'yes or no ', u'right now  you ve seen that old time machines with sand trickling away ', u'like that the bladder is keeping time  ', u'drop  drop  drop ', u'as it fills up ', u'you know what s the time ', u'legs are keeping the time ', u'if you d done your practices regularly ', u'i mean the  tch the program practices ', u'not the book practices ', u'if you d done the program practices regularly ', u'your legs can deceive time ', u'you ', u'your legs don t know what s the time ', u'your legs know  ', u'book  book practice  ', u'so  the program practices are of a different nature', u'that cannot be transmitted', u'unless a certain amount of preparation and ', u'it s a transmission ', u'it s not a teaching ', u'book is a teaching ', u'there is a big difference between teaching and transmission ', u'do not misunderstand both as one ', u'this is a way of creating a smaller step for people ', u'because people are not willing to take one big step ', u'one small step ', u'they read the book and if some small things change ', u'they may take the program ', u'but there is no substitute for sitting properly with eyes closed', u'and doing what is being done properly', u'and not only that ', u'there is no substitute for a transmission ', u'if something is not transmitted ', u'nothing new till happen ', u'improvement of the present will happen ', u'nothing new will happen ', u'with shambhavi we are not looking at improving you ', u'we want something new to sprout in you ', u'something that was never there with you till that moment must happen within you ', u'that s the intent ', u'the book is trying to decorate the', u'existing ', u'whatever you are right now  to make a little improvement ', u'most people are looking for improvements in life ', u'they are not looking for transformation ', u'transformation means nothing of the old should remain ', u'that s transformation ', u'but most people cling to the old ', u'will you leave 2016', u'or will you carry it with you ', u'hmm ', u'can you ', u'though it leaves you  you will not leave it  ', u'2016 will leave you  but you will not leave 2016  isn t it ', u' yes ', u' because you are a creature of memories ', u'if you are a creature of memories ', u'you are a creature of the past ', u'hmm ', u'that means you are a dinosaur which is extinct  ', u'you ve become big because of your memories  isn t it ', u'but you re extinct ', u'tch ', u'what is the use ', u'dinosaur was a big creature  but doesn t exist ', u'what is the use i m asking ', u'like this if you live in your memory ', u'you are big  but what is the use ', u'what is needed is to reverberate with what is there now ', u'memory is good to handle the world ', u'it s good only to handle the world ', u'it s no good to handle this one   isn t it ', u'do you understand what i m saying ', u'memory is good to handle the world around us ', u'we need to remember what happened  ', u'what happened with this person ', u'what happened with that person ', u'what happened with that situation and this situation ', u'we need to remember ', u'it is useful to address the world ', u'but with your silly memory ', u'you cannot address this one ', u'it doesn t mean anything ', u'this one you can address only with consciousness ', u'there is no other way ', u'otherwise you won t have this one ', u'you have assembly of things ', u'see  let me address something very sensitive ', u'i want you to listen to this carefully otherwise you ll come to wrong conclusions ', u'let s say somebody very dear to you dies ', u'or they go away for some reason ', u'you feel like you lost everything ', u'yes or no ', u'you feel like you lost everything', u'because you are making up a life of substitution ', u'where you are not there ', u'you filled it up with other people ', u'when they go away  there is vacuum ', u'but that s not how life is happening ', u'because you are there ', u'only because you are there ', u'you can hold relationships with people  isn t it ', u'hello ', u' yes ', u' but now in your experience you are not there ', u'because you are a creature of memory ', u'you can only remember this one and that one and that one ', u'you can t remember this one ', u'how can you remember this one ', u'because this is a current life ', u'you cannot remember this one ', u'because you re handling everything by memory ', u'you will see', u'when one volume of memory which was a certain person or a situation ', u'if that goes away ', u'it feels like life has come to an end ', u'simply because', u'a certain amount of investment you ve made in a certain amount of memory you have about a specific person ', u'so if you live by memory ', u'i m saying 2016 will leave you but you will not leave 2016 ', u'if you don t leave 2016 ', u'how do you go to 2017 ', u'you cannot ', u'you drag all these years and go into 2017 ', u'there s no such thing ', u'you will be on a treadmill ', u'you ll get the exercise but you won t go anywhere ', u'treadmill is fine if the weather is bad  ', u'but it s not a vehicle to go somewhere ', u'this much you must understand ', u'memory is a treadmill ', u'yes ', u'memory is a treadmill ', u'it is all right to handle situations around us', u'but you re not going to go anywhere with it ', u'but human beings have invested so much in their memory ', u'there s hardly a handful who will go with me on this one ', u'tch ', u'i m asking ', u'how many of you really want to step into 2017 ', u'fully  leaving 2016 behind ', u' yeah  yes ', u' whoa  whoa  whoa  ', u'if you really  if really  really i m saying ', u'if you can leave the past as past  completely ', u'if you can sit here just in the present ', u'no past ', u'you re enlightened  you know ', u'that s all it takes ', u'it s the burden of the past', u'which doesn t let you flower into a full possibility ', u'just the burden of the past ', u'so this is a good moment ', u'this is not something that the planet is doing  okay ', u'tch ', u'yes the solstice has just happened ', u'that is there ', u'but every day planet is spinning ', u'every day it is moving ', u'in the trajectory of the planetary movement around the sun', u'you can choose any point to get enlightened ', u'you don t have to wait for this point  ', u'yes or no ', u'but anyway we are at this point', u'where somewhere in your mind you ve been told it is significant ', u'it s only significant because there is a memory of 2016 ', u'if there is no memory of 2016 ', u'in what way there is a 2017 ', u'there is no such thing ', u'no  no  this is', u' sadhguru  you re confusing us  ', u'sixteen ', u'sixteen ', u'seventeen  ', u'it s correct  arithmetically correct ', u'yes ', u'but only because there is memory ', u'there is sixteen and there is seventeen  isn t it ', u' yes ', u' so if you know how to simply sit here', u'without being burdened by your memory ', u'without being a product of memory ', u'when i say product of memory  ', u'your likes ', u'your dislikes', u'whom you love ', u'whom you don t love ', u'who is your friend ', u'who is your enemy ', u'all this comes because of your memory  isn t it ', u'if you can keep all that aside', u'and let the new year blossom ', u'you will blossom into a wonderful creature ', u'spraying fragrance into the world ', u'well ', u'there won t be any attendant music', u'nor will there be an applause ', u'but if really beautiful things happen who cares', u'whether it is appreciated by somebody  or not  ', u'hey ', u'where is the attendant music ', u'what happened to the musicians  ', u'come on ', u'nothing so wonderful happened ', u'so let s have some music  ', u'what ', u' what is this ', u'what did you say ', u' isha home school', u'  i have no such mission ', u'it s for the parents to decide where they want to send their children ', u'hmm ', u' so what do you want to do with them  eh  ', u' oh  you re thinking of starting a school here ', u' yes  yes ', u'so many children', u' look at that one  ', u' she is a missionary  i m not  ', u'anyway ', u'just to tell you a few things ', u'one thing is ', u'on february twenty fourth is a once in a lifetime kind of event for isha', u'that we re unveiling this hundred and twelve feet tall face of adiyogi', u'in coimbatore', u'in the isha yoga center in india ', u'it s going to be a massive campaign ', u'particularly in india', u'but even internationally there will be a certain level of campaign ', u'the fundamental idea is to use this iconic face as a galvanizing force  ', u'as i said the book is getting ready  ', u'to use it as a galvanizing force', u'to move people  ', u'it s a dangerous thing to say in tennessee  ', u'to move people from religion to responsibility ', u'why i m saying this is  ', u'humanity has become like this ', u'if small things go wrong in their life ', u'they will find one little guy to blame   ', u' because of him ', u'if big things go wrong in their life ', u'they ll find that big guy   ', u' because of him ', u'what about this guy  ', u'some of the studies show that on an average all indian rivers are depleting by eight percent per year ', u'that means in about fifteen to twenty years ', u'almost all the rivers which have been perennial will become seasonal', u'for variety of reasons ', u'so for the last three years i ve been working on this', u'and we ve come up with a kind of a  a policy that the government has to take up ', u'we ve worked with a couple of state governments', u'which they re already trying to implement ', u'i ve managed to convince two chief ministers and make this happen ', u'i ve recently put this across to the prime minister', u'and he s agreed to this in principle ', u'but to raise this awareness across the country', u'because most people are unaware of it completely ', u'so ', u'and also', u'it s been a long time since i drove across the country ', u'so  we re driving from leh ladakh which is the ta  northernmost tip of india', u'to kanyakumari', u'and back on the east coast', u'and back to delhi ', u'totally about 12 000 kilometers ', u'about sixteen major events will happen on the way ', u'so those of you who can drive in india ', u'because it takes a different level of skill ', u'if you wish to be a part of that ', u'we will do this rally of a certain number of people ', u'some can ride on a electric bus ', u'rest can drive ', u'there ll be probably two or four electric busses', u'and maybe twenty five to fifty cars ', u'in each segment ', u'lot more will join', u'but this complete trip will be approximately twenty five cars and two busses probably ', u'it ll be finalized later', u'but there will be major events in all the cities', u'to raise the awareness about the rivers in india ', u'so we want to involve the entire population in the cities ', u'there ll be rivers you know', u'river related quizzes for the children ', u'people will run for the rivers ', u'people will cycle for the rivers ', u'people will do all kinds of things', u'for rivers on that day', u'when the event comes to that city ', u'and above all to make a policy document', u'and when we come back to delhi ', u'we re having a conference where we present this', u'along with the chief ministers of many states', u'we re going to sign a river accord', u'as to what the policy should be about rivers ', u'even now ', u'different states are fighting with each other for river waters ', u'not realizing that in another fifteen twenty years ', u'there may be nothing to fight about  ', u'yes ', u'it s a serious situation ', u'so this is going to happen ', u'if some of you wish to participate in this ', u'it s going to be an incredible experience of', u'driving across the length and breadth of india ', u'which is by any standards', u'the most colorful nation on the planet  ', u'chaotic  but colorful  ', u' it should take about twenty five days ', u'anywhere between twenty to twenty five days  i think ', u' hmm  i m sorry ', u'    about the school  ', u'especially in    ', u' she s gonna do it anyway  so ', u'i m not against it but i m not for it either  ', u'i m definitely not against it', u'but i know what it takes to run a good school ', u'it s not about buildings ', u'getting the right people with', u'long term commitment', u'to well being of children', u'who may not be theirs but', u'when you have children who are not yours ', u'you have to do much more than what you would do with yours ', u'i need people like that who are willing to do a lot more with somebody else s children', u'than they would do with their own ', u'if there are such people ', u'a school will come together anyway  ', u'if you live by this silly standard of what is yours and what is not yours ', u'anyway you will live in a very small space on this planet', u'and in this cosmos ', u'if you have no sense of what is yours and what is not yours ', u'everything will be open to you ', u'that s my blessing to you  ', u'let the entire cosmos be yours ', u'why are you stingy ', u'why are you even stingy in your greediness ', u'at least in your greed be boundless ', u'hmm ', u'i m not saying generosity ', u'i m saying greed ', u'at least in your greed ', u'let there be no limit ', u'that you want everything to be yours  ', u'that s greed ', u'ultimate ', u'that s my blessing  ', u'may you become greedy

ref = [u' the business of introducing sadhguru jaggi vasudev ', u'who s been described in many different ways in my profession ', u'by people from my profession ', u'we ve called you a maverick  ', u'we ve called you a monk on a motorcycle ', u'we ve called you a glamorous  flamboyant guru', u'but for your devotees you are simply sadhguru ', u'and yet sadhguru ', u'at a time when', u'faith seems to be in collision with', u'so many other questions that come up as a matter of individual liberty ', u'i think this will make for a very interesting and important conversation for our times ', u'so i would like to thank you for being part of this conversation ', u'let me start with the spiritual', u'and i hope what you say today is also addressed to the skeptics ', u'i count myself among a skeptic ', u'who if told that another human being possesses some sort of godly power ', u'i would perhaps as the first instinct  not believe it', u'but what i find interesting about what you ve s', u'some of your sayings  as captured by arundhati subramaniam in this book ', u'is that you re actually saying that', u'what we experience beyond our five senses ', u'anything that we experience beyond the five senses can be called god ', u'can be called power or can be called yourself ', u'so if god doesn t necessarily exist ', u'why do we need gurus ', u'why do we need sadhguru  ', u' do you drive in delhi ', u' do i drive ', u' mhmm  ', u' unlike you ', u'i have a fear of wheels  ', u' so if you drive in an unknown terrain', u' yes ', u'  you use these days a gps ', u' yes ', u' usually  a strange woman will tell you ', u' turn right  you turn right ', u'she says   turn left   you turn left ', u'she says   make a u turn  you make a u turn  ', u'why ', u'simply because you are', u'you re not familiar with the terrain ', u'when you are in an unfamiliar terrain ', u'it is sensible to take instructions  ', u' so are you', u'are you saying gurus are the new gps  ', u' not new  not new ', u'long time ago we ve been  ', u'for a very long time  way before the gps came  ', u'gps means what   guru positioning system  ', u' but you know  i have to say that while i don t drive ', u'i ve often sat in the car and heard that girl s voice on google maps', u'and often google maps', u' you can actually  you can actually', u'  does not  does not adv', u'does not give you the right advice ', u' you can change it to a man s voice if you wish ', u' okay  ', u'this beginning of this conversation perhaps underlines that you are atypical ', u'you are atypical of what we imagine gurus to be ', u'we expect people who don t crack jokes ', u'we expect people who don t have a zest for life ', u'somehow  all of our spirituality has traditionally been centered around giving up ', u'around abstinence of some kind ', u'around abstaining from pleasures ', u'from denying creature comforts ', u'why do you believe that the material can co exist with the spiritual ', u' it s  it s not that i believe ', u'it s only because you have a body which is your physicality ', u'you have a life within ', u'if you did not have a body ', u'if you re disembodied ', u'i m not going to talk to you ', u'because with disembodied beings you don t have conversations  okay ', u'i know people', u' people do talk to ghosts ', u' people are trying to do that these days  ', u'because they re not on talking terms with the living  ', u'they choose the dead ', u'because you can make the dead speak whatever you want ', u'the living will speak what they want  it s a big problem  ', u'it s a very serious problem in a conversation', u'because i will say what i want to say', u'if i was dead  you can make me say whatever you want to say ', u' but can an', u' because you can do both sides of the conversation ', u' but if your philosophy', u'you hate the word philosophy i know', u'if your technology of inner engineering', u'and we ll talk more about that in just a moment', u'is available to all of us to  in a sense find strength within ourselves ', u'sadhguru ', u'then does that mean that the atheist and the agnostic and the skeptic', u'can also embrace spirituality ', u'is inner engineering only for those who believe', u'or is it for anyone  who asks questions ', u' the previous question is a loaded one  still not answered fully ', u' yes  i know   i haven t', u'i haven t given up on it yet  ', u' coming to this ', u'see you re putting atheists and agnostics and skeptics together', u'it s a wrong classification ', u'atheists and theists are together  they re one kind ', u' because they both have certainty ', u' both  both believe something that they do not know ', u'both are not sincere enough to admit that they do not know ', u'this is the biggest problem ', u'the biggest problem in the world is', u'people are still not straight enough to come to a place ', u' what i know i know  what i do not know i do not know ', u'because they have not realized the immensity of  i do not know ', u' i do not know  is the basis of longing to know', u'and seeking to know and the possibility of knowing ', u'the moment you destroy  i do not know ', u'you destroyed all possibilities of knowing ', u'so this is atheism and this is theism ', u'they re not different ', u'they re in the same boat ', u'they pretend to be different ', u'one believes positively ', u'another believes negatively', u'but they both believe something that they do not know ', u'one  person  a well known person in the country', u'who goes about claiming he s an atheist all the time ', u'one day comes up to me ', u'somebody just introduces me first time ', u"i said  namaste'", u'he says   do you know  i believe there is no god ', u'i said   i don t even believe that   ', u' do you mean javed akhtar  ', u' i  i m not', u' that was a good imitation ', u'so i guessed   it wasn t difficult ', u' i am not  taking names ', u'i am saying the thing is you also believe something ', u'you don t seem to understand that ', u'the most important thing is to come to this place of', u'being utterly straight and sincere with life  ', u'what i know i know  what i do not know i do not know ', u'if you come to this much ', u'if you closely pay attention to everything around you ', u'you will see with all this scientific exploration ', u'we do not know even a single atom in its entirety ', u'that s the fact ', u' so what is it that you know sadhguru  ', u'why are millions of people your devotees', u'because you just said that honesty ', u' they usually don t', u'  is about admitting', u' they  they don t claim that they are my devotees  you know ', u' what do they say then ', u' hmm ', u' what do they say then ', u' usually they claim they re meditators ', u'volunteers  and stuff  ', u' okay  volunteers then  ', u'but there must be something they think that you know', u'because you just said that life is actually about admitting what you don t know ', u'the corollary to that is there are things that you do know ', u'we do know we re sitting at the habitat center amphitheatre at this moment in delhi  ', u'that we know ', u'what beyond this sadhguru  do you know and what do you not know  ', u'i ve asked you like is there a question of', u' now  what do i know ', u'i don t know anything except this one  ', u'i know this piece of life from its origin to its ultimate ', u'everything that i need to know about this life  i know ', u'and i see every other life is actually the same thing ', u'if you look deep enough ', u'so in that context ', u'because today modern science is coming to this ', u'there is a  a theory which is evolving ', u'which is called as constructional theory', u'what they are beginning to say is', u'whether it s an amoeba or a grasshopper or a earthworm', u'or a bird or an animal or an elephant or you or me', u'or the whole cosmos ', u'the fundamental design is same ', u'it is only a question of complexities and sophistication of the same design ', u'so this is something always the yogic science has been saying ', u'that if you know  you know anda you know pindanda   you know ', u'if you know the atomic  you know the cosmic', u'because the fundamental design is same ', u'it s only a question of complexity and sophistication of what s happening ', u'so fundamentally  if you know this piece of life ', u'you know everything by inference ', u' but when you say this piece of life  do you mean yourself ', u'do you mean this moment ', u'what do you mean by this piece of life ', u' you are a piece of life  aren t you ', u'are you life or', u'are you media  ', u' are they mutually exclusive ', u' are have  mediums ', u'that s why i m saying  ', u' i would hope i m a flesh and blood person', u'unless somebody knows better  ', u' flesh and blood you gathered  isn t it ', u' yes ', u' what you call as my flesh and blood ', u'you slowly gathered over a period of time ', u'if this much accumulation of flesh and blood ', u'this much impressions have to be gathered ', u'there must be something more fundamental  isn t it ', u' do you think of yourself as a yogi  a mystic or a guru ', u' i ve not wasted time thinking about myself  ', u' what would you rather be thinking of ', u' i don t think usually ', u'really ', u'for me  see th  this whole thing ', u'because of the type of very mediocre education that s being delivered today ', u'we have raised thought to heaven unfortunately ', u'thought is a simple thing ', u'i know this is against everything that you believe in', u'because you are also a believer  ', u' no ', u' believer in thought ', u' yeah ', u' yes ', u' i believe in being able to ask questions ', u' yes ', u' that s what i do for a living ', u' oh   that s good ', u' so i must believe that it is possible to ask questions ', u' you  you ask questions for a living ', u'my life is full of questions  ', u'now  now the thing is what you call as thought', u'is coming from the limited data that you have gathered from the experience of your life ', u'every person is the same thing ', u'how much ever we have gathered ', u'it s still too small compared to the size of this cosmos', u'and the way the phenomena of life is happening ', u'from this limited da  data ', u'you can recycle things and generate thought ', u'or in other words ', u'nothing new ever happens ', u'same permutations and combinations of the same thing will go on forever ', u'the essence of what we re teaching in the name of inner engineering is', u'to engineer yourself in such a way ', u'every moment of your life is a new possibility ', u'if it has to become a new possibility ', u'what is needed is perception ', u'when i say perception  people think opinions ', u'no  i am talking about perception ', u'as you see here  ', u'similarly enhancing your perception so that you perceive life ', u'right now when we say thought  emotion ', u'we re talking about expressing life ', u'expression is not so important ', u'once in a way we can express', u'but perceiving it is important', u'because this phenomena is too fantastic ', u'it s not a small thing ', u'the greatest phenomena that s happening here is life itself ', u'so if you want to know this phenomena ', u'the only way you can know ', u'the only doorway for you to know life is yourself ', u'see  right now can you see me ', u' yes  i can ', u' can you', u'can you use a finger and point out where i am  ', u'oh  you re wrong ', u'you know i m a mystic from south india  ', u'now this light is falling upon me  reflecting  going through your lenses ', u'inverted image in the retina  you know the whole story ', u'where do you see me now ', u' still in the same place ', u' no ', u' i do ', u' you see me the way i m projected in the firmament of your mind ', u'you cannot see me here  in the very nature of your visual apparatus ', u'where do you hear me right now ', u'within yourself ', u'where have you seen the whole world ', u'within yourself ', u'now if there is a grasshopper here ', u'he doesn t see me the way you see me ', u'he sees me differently ', u'he sees the whole world differently ', u'now you  you can think   oh  he s no good ', u'this is the fundamental problem that we think his perception is no good ', u'no  no  his perception is very good for his survival ', u'your perception is very good for your survival', u'but it s not good enough to know the nature of life ', u' but i', u' so now   what do i know  means i have enhanced', u'enhanced my perception the way it is important', u'to know the nature of life ', u'not just for survival ', u' but if inner engineering as a spiritual technology is something that works ', u'i ask you again ', u'why do we need gurus  because', u'that means the answers are within us ', u' you re speaking so much language ', u'did you learn a  b  c  d', u' i think so ', u' do you remember when you re four years of age ', u'that damn  a  how complicated it was ', u' yes ', u' two versions to it ', u'you had to write it a hundred times to get the damn  a ', u'today you can close your eyes and write ', u'so it doesn t matter how simple something is ', u'without a certain guidance ', u'could you have picked up a  b  c  i m asking ', u'no ', u'similarly  when something new you have to approach ', u'if you don t have the right kind of guidance ', u'you won t pick it up ', u' tell us a little bit about yourself ', u'your story is well chronicled', u'but what is of interest to people is that you started off as', u' i haven t read that book ', u'i don t know ', u'i hope she s written nice things about me  ', u' she s written a very brilliant ', u'arundhati s  subramaniam has written a very brilliant ', u'very brilliant book ', u' no  she s brilliant', u'but what s she written about me  ', u' one of the things that she has said is that', u'you give great space for dissent ', u'you like a good argument ', u'that you re not an  you re not one of those dictatorial gurus  ', u' i don t know where is a dictatorial guru ', u'i think the  most people have not met a guru ', u'they have just seen calendar images and made conclusions ', u'i don t think they have met any genuine guru ', u'there are a whole lot of people who should have been temple priests', u'who are good entrepreneurs and they ve become gurus today  ', u'that s different  okay  ', u' temple priests', u' no  no  see', u'   who have become good entrepreneurs ', u' no  i m saying', u' just another word of', u'way of saying they re charlatans ', u' that s a strong word ', u'maybe that s enterprise  ', u'i am not a enterprise ', u'so because i am not an enterprise ', u'i want everybody to ask whatever the damn question they have ', u'it doesn t matter how ridiculous or how intelligent ', u'how nonsensical it is  it doesn t matter ', u'if the question means something to you ', u'it means something to me ', u'it doesn t matter how brilliant it is ', u'if it doesn t mean anything to you ', u'i am not willing to listen to it ', u' but you re saying that many ', u'many people are  who are positioning themselves as gurus', u'are really only elevating themselves and fooling people  i ve', u'  no  i didn t say', u' okay  i m saying that ', u' i m saying ', u' but', u'  the thing there is there is a vacuum ', u'somebody is trying to fill it ', u' yes  and sadhguru  you have been', u' are they qualified to be that ', u'questionable thing ', u' but a very genuine concern', u'and you have been on some of my television programs', u'where we have spoken about this  ', u'is whether god men are often con men ', u'and how does this lady here  know the difference', u'between who s a god man and who s a conman', u'and is a human being capable of being a god man ', u'do you think of yourself as a god man ', u'  why are you underestimating that lady  ', u' okay  let it be my question  ', u'how do i spot the difference between a god man and a con man', u'if i don t even believe that humans can be godly ', u'i think humans can be brave and wonderful and inspiring and', u'but i don t think that they have magical powers ', u' see  did you ever see god having magical powers ', u' no  i ve never seen god ', u' no  then why are you saying he must have magical powers  ', u'so first of all ', u'this god man is essentially a media coined word ', u'nobody claims that he is a god man  okay ', u'some are goddamn men  that s different  ', u'nobody', u'i don t think anybody has personally claimed ', u' i am a god man ', u'i have not met anybody like that ', u'now  that is a', u'that s another kind of profession ', u'putting labels on everybody  you know  ', u'leaving that alone  what is it ', u'this is a culture   you must understand this ', u'it s unfortunately all mixed up today', u'this is a godless culture  you must understand this ', u'there has never been an idea of a god in this culture ', u'only in competition with what came from outside ', u'because we saw they could rule us ', u'they were dominant and we thought we have to imitate their ways ', u'we also started making it up to some extent ', u'not successfully though ', u'yes ', u'but we know the technology of god making ', u'when i say technology', u'we are using the english word  god ', u'but that word doesn t exist in india ', u'here we call them devas ', u'what a deva means is', u'see today media is projecting tendulkar as a cricketing god ', u'it s very appropriate to this culture', u'because if somebody excels beyond a certain level in any field', u'he may be a sportsperson ', u'he may be a warrior ', u'he may be an artist ', u'he may be anything  ', u'if he excels beyond what normally average human beings think is possible for them ', u'he goes ', u'they recognized him as a deva', u'and he s worth looking up to', u'because he becomes a guiding light for them ', u'that ll anyway happen  whether you like it  you believe it  you don t believe it ', u' sure ', u' in every field  somebody rises  he becomes the light for the rest of the people ', u' yes ', u' so similarly  in the inner spaces', u'when i say the inner spaces ', u'the quality of your life is not determined by what kind of house you live in ', u'what clothes you wear ', u'what car you parked outside ', u'what things  jing bang happening around you ', u'no ', u'this moment how joyful  peaceful  blissed out you are within yourself ', u'now if i sit here ', u'we re sitting here in the same space ', u'breathing the same air ', u'probably we ate the same kind of food', u'i don t know what you eat ', u'but if i sit here now with my eyes closed ', u'the way i am within myself ', u'i will not exchange this  for anything in the universe ', u'now  when people see  no matter', u'the number of things i m managing is insane ', u'everybody thinks ', u' sadhguru  is it possible  you must go crazy someday ', u'all volunteers  over three million volunteers ', u'enterprises  businesses  okay  projects  mega projects on the street ', u'all kinds of activity going', u'around the globe ', u'if anybody has to go nuts  it s me  okay ', u'because all run by volunteers ', u'run by volunteers means', u'nobody is trained for the job', u'and you can t fire them for inefficiency because they re volunteers  ', u'all right  ', u'and anytime  they come in anytime and do great things ', u'anytime they ll walk away  all right ', u'and nothing should collapse ', u'till now  i must tell you this ', u'as we are sitting here  this day ', u'probably little over three hundred and odd programs ', u'inner engineering programs are happening in the world ', u'never in the last thirty three years ', u'one program has been abandoned or has failed  ', u'that  that takes enormous management', u'but nobody will ever see me getting angry or miserable or tensed out or stressed out ', u' you ve never lost your temper ', u' you want me to now   ', u'do i look like i m incapable of that ', u'it s not that ', u'it s not that i m incapable of anger ', u"it's just that i have never given that privilege to anybody ", u'i ve not given this privilege to anybody  ', u'they can make me happy ', u'they can make me unhappy ', u'they can make me angry ', u'they can make me miserable ', u'no ', u'i kept  these privileges to myself ', u'so people', u'you re talking about miracles or whatever ', u'people ask me ', u' sadhguru  everybody  in very ashram  miracles are happening ', u'you are beating all the miracles down ', u'if we say something happened ', u'you make us look like fools ', u'no miracle ', u'i say   what  you want me to pull a pigeon out of my pocket   ', u'if i pull a pigeon', u' but there are', u' no  if i ', u'  gurus', u' if i', u'  who claim to do that ', u'who have been challenged by rationalists', u' no  i ll come to this ', u'if i pull a pigeon out of my pocket ', u'i have a shitty pocket ', u'and you have a bird ', u'what are you going to do with this ', u'you come to me  i will show you the miracle ', u'i have thousands of people ', u'who are working seven days a week ', u'sixteen to eighteen days  eighteen hours every day ', u'in the last two  five ten years ', u'not a single moment of irritation  agitation  anger in their life ', u'this is a miracle  ', u'this is a miracle we want to manifest ', u'you don t want a miracle ', u' i agree  this is a miracle ', u' yes ', u' and not that pigeon ', u'do you have a pigeon in your pocket   okay  ', u' i told you i don t like a shitty pocket  ', u' i know   now  you were thirteen', u'in arundhati s book ', u'i read that you were thirteen when you first quite accidentally discovered yoga ', u'you were children playing in', u'at the bottom of a well  that s what the book says  ', u'tell us  how did you discover yoga ', u' oh   i told that because that s how it happened to me ', u'i said that to her ', u'i don t know how she s written  i ve not read it  ', u'i said that to her because i want people to understand', u'the nature of the universe is ', u'even if you do  for the wrong reasons ', u'you do the right thing  still it works ', u'if you do the wrong thing even for the right reasons  it still doesn t work ', u'people need to understand this', u'because the whole world has invested on goodness ', u'the goddamn goodness is killing the world ', u'there re too many good people', u'and these good people are the biggest problem ', u'it s always a good indian who wants to fight a good pakistani ', u'good hindu wants to fight a good muslim ', u'good american wants to fight with just about anybody  ', u'the more good you are ', u'the more fighting you are ', u'the more good you think you are ', u'because goodness is always in comparison', u' don t forget the good journalists', u'who promote these fighting everyday on channels  ', u' i  i think  because your goodness comes', u'by comparing yourself to somebody ', u'if you were alone on this planet  you wouldn t know', u'whether you re good or bad ', u'what we need on this planet is sensible human beings ', u'little more sense we could do with  isn t it  for sure ', u'in every aspect of life ', u'engineering essentially means', u'you could have built this structure whichever way you want', u'but you ll have to keep looking up ', u'when it s going to crash on your head ', u'engineering means you put it up in a sensible manner ', u'the way it stays  without anxiety about it ', u'similarly  inner engineering means you engineer yourself in such a way ', u'you can go through the process of life', u'without being anxious about your suffering', u' what will happen to me ', u'there is no such thing because you engineered yourself well ', u'whatever the hell happens around you ', u'within yourself you are the same thing ', u'so every time i launch one mega project ', u'you ll say   sadhguru  if it doesn t work ', u'if it doesn t work  what  ', u'if it doesn t work  what ', u'if everything that i m doing  if nothing works  i will still die blissfully ', u'this is guaranteed ', u'i want to make sure it s guaranteed for every human being', u'so that they can live their life without the fear of suffering ', u'right now  instead of seeing how suffering should go ', u'people are busy romanticizing suffering ', u'the moment you romanticize suffering ', u'it s very clear you are not interested in human well being ', u'you like drama ', u' hmm  you often spoke about', u'how economic leaders are going to be the future of the world ', u'you ve been interacting with ceos ', u'it s rare to find a spiritual guru who s also quite openly capitalistic ', u'are you a capitalist ', u' what is that ', u' who believes that wealth creation is for the greater good  of people and society ', u' see  a whole lot of people are attached to poverty right now', u'because without poor people ', u'without hungry people they cannot survive ', u'i am not one of those ', u'i want to see that  six hundred million people on  in this country', u'are postponing their dinner tonight ', u'but we are postponing major decisions in the parliament every day  all right ', u'i am not a part of that ', u'i want things to happen because i know what it means to postpone a dinner ', u'i don t want that to happen to pe  people ', u'children are postponing their dinner tonight ', u'probably a hundred million children in this country have postponed their dinner to tomorrow', u'and that s not a joke ', u'so  these jokers who identify themselves with this or that', u'are going on playing their joke on the people ', u'every day ', u'so capitalism is an ancient word  it no more exists ', u'we are talking about a market economy ', u'when only a few families had access to capital  it was capitalism ', u'it is no more capitalism ', u'any  if you have a good idea', u'and you know how to execute it ', u'there is capital for everyone  all right ', u'so  we have tried communism ', u'it s a wonderful idea but that must happen willingly ', u'if you enforce it  it s the ugliest thing ', u'we have seen it', u'we have seen a major demo on the planet ', u'when a  most ugly things happened  you tried to enforce it ', u'karl marx might have known lot about economy ', u'you know  i was  i  when i was fifteen ', u'i was all gung ho about engels  and karl marx and stuff ', u'but he did not understand human nature ', u'i realized that when i was sixteen ', u'thirteen  fourteen  i was all fired up reading up all the communist literature from russia ', u'but by the time i was sixteen ', u'i realized these people don t understand what is human aspiration ', u'without understanding what s human aspiration ', u'you try to build a society ', u'you try to build a nation  it s a disaster  okay ', u'cruel disaster ', u'but maybe it will work when really a country or a society is in total dumps ', u'you have to force it out ', u'when you have to force it out ', u'it works', u'but after that it won t work ', u'in a way  if you come to the ashram', u'nearly four thousand people are living in the ashram  ', u'well  you can say it s communist but by willingness ', u'it s not by   okay  i did so much  so i get so much    no ', u'everybody gets what they need ', u'so this is not enforced  this is by choice ', u'if by choice you re willing to share  how fantastic it is ', u'but  i have nothing  you have something  i want you to share    how ugly it is ', u' what is it with sadhguru and motorcycles  ', u' these days ', u'i m on four wheels  ', u' but you haven t given up  your love for bikes or have you ', u' it s just that when i was', u'i started  you know  trekking in the jungles when i was ten  eleven ', u'i would be gone ', u'if i had ten rupees in my pocket ', u'i would organize my food and i m gone with this little note in the house ', u'i can imagine my parents ', u'i  i always wished i shouldn t have a boy ever  ', u' girls can run away too on bikes ', u' they run later  ', u'they don t run at ten  eleven  ', u'and they re on a pillion', u'they re usually pillion and if they find a good rider  no problem  ', u'i m saying the thing was ', u'it s not about the motorcycle or this or that ', u'it is just that i was a cloud of million questions all the time', u'and wherever i looked  nobody had a sensible answer ', u'everybody has standard answers that they ve heard from somewhere ', u'nobody has a genuine experiential answer ', u'so there s a restlessness to explore just about anything ', u'when i was ten  eleven years of age  i would be gone into the forest', u'for three  four days ', u'once food ran out and i couldn t survive  then i would come back ', u'so  initially lot of excitement', u'but later on they kind of settled down ', u'they knew i ll get back ', u'so when i became fourteen  fifteen ', u'i cycled across south india ', u'not because i was one cycling enthusiast ', u'not like today ', u'wearing a helmet and suited booted for cycling   no ', u'simply i cycled because cycling is little faster than walking ', u'the moment i became seventeen ', u'i still didn t have a license but i found a motor to my cycle ', u'which became a motorcycle  ', u'so that because it went little faster ', u'it s  it supported my restlessness to know something i didn t even know what the hell it is ', u'i didn t know what i was looking for', u'but i had questions about anything i looked at ', u'everything in the universe looked like a question mark to me ', u' but the question about the motorcycle is really to ask', u'whether the motorcycle  the land rover or land cruiser  which one is it now ', u'land rover  land cruiser   i m not sure ', u'but whatever  the four wheels  the helicopter  you', u'i think you once said somewhere that i like', u'that whether if it moves on land  water or air  i like it ', u' this is not', u'one thing is i like anything that works and machines work  ', u'the more efficiently  work  the better they are', u'and why it s important is  after all ', u'what is the quality of an individual human being ', u'how smoothly and how efficiently your body  mind and everything functions', u'is the quality of a human being  isn t it ', u'so machines always excited me ', u'whether it s a s  bicycle or motorcycle or because of you know', u'lack of the necessary  probably the fitness that i was at that time ', u'i crisscrossed india on a motorcycle ', u'today it would be hard  so you get into something little more comfortable ', u' but you know while that makes you a very interesting character to observe ', u'did you ever worry that you d be labeled or dubbed a richie rich  person s guru ', u'this is you know  this is the sadhguru who', u' see  the thing is', u'  flies his own planes', u' no', u'  who likes his bmw ', u'who like his game of golf ', u'who likes having a little frisbee match on the   ', u'  l  let s  let s come to that ', u'see  the thing is i would', u'i wouldn t mind', u'i even  sometimes we  i  i ride a bullock cart ', u'nobody reports that though  ', u'i  i  i love to handle the bulls and', u'i  i still drive that sometimes ', u'but now you  i want to have a conversation with you ', u'this afternoon till two o clock  i was in jodhpur ', u'i could have come by bullock cart or a camel cart  ', u'you had to wait for five days  ', u'i came on time  you must appreciate that  ', u' so it s about efficiency is what you re saying ', u' yes  so i l  i personally learnt to fly a helicopter', u'where i don t have the time for these things', u'but i somehow fit in this and learnt because', u'seventy percent of our work is in rural india ', u'tch  i thought this little helicopter could just', u'i could set the place on fire', u'because i m half the time stuck', u'half my life  i m on the road stuck in some traffic driving myself ', u'all the time  behind huge', u'everywhere  there s no place in the country where there s no traffic jams ', u'believe me  even in rural india  there re traffic jams ', u'so i thought a helicopter would really revolutionize our work ', u'i picked up the thing  i got my license ', u'faa license but in india it s so difficult to get the license', u'because many of these rules were made before wright brothers  came  ', u' well  according to some ', u'the plane was also made before the wright brothers came  ', u'they say it was made in the vedic ages  they', u" they're not very wrong ", u'conceptually  it was made ', u'whether physically they built or not ', u'we don t have proof for that  conceptually  there s no', u' conceptually  it s about imagination to think', u'that you can move from place a to place b', u' no  no  no  no  no  no  no ', u'you cannot conceptually imagine something entirely ', u'even if you imagine ', u'you must be able to produce some', u'you must understand the principles in some way  as to why something flies ', u'if you don t understand why something flies  it ll be like that you know once it happened ', u'a little turtle  very  with great effort ', u'climbed a tree  went to the edge of a branch and jumped  fell flat  lot of pain ', u'slowly  again he crawled up  in another two days  again up  jumped  fell down  again up  fell down ', u'after a few days  two birds who were sitting in the opposite tree ', u'they were talking and they said ', u' i think it s time we tell him he s adopted   ', u'all right  ', u'so i m saying what cannot fly ', u'you cannot make it fly ', u'people thought in detail  as to what can fly ', u'what cannot fly ', u'conceptually they thought ', u'whether they built or not  we don t know ', u'and is it  is it  i mean  it is an established fact ', u'they calculated the speed of light ', u'somebody  some individual cannot calculate the speed of light just like that', u'if there was no whole scientific culture around him ', u'no individual will just drop from heaven and calculate the speed of light  okay ', u'there must have been a scientific culture ', u'otherwise it won t happen ', u'but we need to understand there is a difference between science and technology ', u' but there s also a difference between science and mythology ', u'some things are just great stories', u'that doesn t mean they actually happened ', u' see for example ', u'there are  there are images or there are sketches which show ', u'which probably somewhere between three to four thousand years ago were made ', u'where it clearly shows a turtle and a round planet sitting on it and going around ', u'turtle is the best example ', u'best analogy for a planetary movement', u'because a turtle cannot accelerate  ', u'same speed  he just keeps going ', u'so a round planet on a turtle', u'is the best way to describe how a planet moves around ', u'and the very word for geography in this country is bhoogol ', u'which means it s a round planet ', u'so it is not because of galileo we know it s a round planet ', u'we ve always known ', u'how do we know ', u'we can t know just one scientific fact and not know the other aspects related to it ', u'so this thing about anything indian  beating it down  is because', u'one thing is that culture has evolved because half the people ', u'their brains are in greenwich mean time ', u'they ve still not gotten out of the 1948  whatever happened ', u'we struggled for independence  we came out ', u'not just to send them out but to be who we are ', u'so  that problem is still there', u'and now there are upstarts who claim all kinds of things ', u'there has to be an even balance ', u'not beating down this or pumping it up in a  unrealistic way ', u'but you cannot deny indian mind has thought about things', u'that nobody had thought about in those times ', u'there is no question about that ', u'but there is a distinction between science and technology ', u'science can evolve because of certain intelligence ', u'technology needs material manifestation ', u'now we are trying to claim technology  which we should not ', u'if we just focus on science ', u'many things will be attributed to india for sure ', u' we live in times when faith and spirituality have become very inflammable', u' don t put them in the same basket ', u' okay  let s talk about faith first ', u' mhmm  ', u' we live in times when faith for certain has become a very inflammable ', u'easily politicized conversation ', u'if faith should have been personal today  it s not ', u'today you actually have decisions taken in the name of somebody s faith being injured ', u'so you mentioned food right now ', u'i read somewhere that you said there s nothing religious about the act of food ', u'just eat what you like ', u' no  no  no  i didn t say that ', u' eat what s good for you ', u' i said eat what s good for you ', u' okay  eat what s good for you ', u' it s a very different thing  ', u' i correct myself    eat what s good for you ', u'but today we have a highly politicized conversation around banning beef in the name of faith ', u'how', u' it s definitely not good for you to eat it ', u' beef or any meat ', u' i ll come to that ', u'finish it  finish the question ', u' okay  okay  so i m offering that as one example of', u'how i see a politicized conversation taking place around faith ', u'how do you reconcile the faith of a large number of people', u'with questions of individual liberty ', u'i know i have read that you like books written by salman rushdie ', u'we were the first country to ban him again in the name of faith ', u'how do we reconcile faith with individual liberty ', u' see  it s always been said  faith moves mountains ', u'yes  but it freezes your mind ', u'but the greatest crime you can do on this planet is to move a mountain ', u'you should not move a mountain  it should be where it is ', u'it has not just dropped from somewhere ', u'it s grown because of various forces functioning in a particular way ', u'phenomenal activity has happened to build a mountain ', u'you should never move a mountain', u'but  people with frozen minds always want to move a mountain  okay ', u'having said that ', u'when we say faith ', u'it s an import for this culture ', u'we have never had faith in this culture ', u'you must look back little beyond thousand years', u'since we ve been under occupation ', u'here  we have been told always   your life is your karma ', u'karma means action ', u'whose action  your action ', u'so what we are saying is your life is entirely your making ', u'there is no someone sitting up there and managing this for you ', u'this is entirely yours', u'but for every action that you perform', u'whether physical  mental  emotional  energy wis', u'whatever kind of action you perform  there is bound to be a consequence ', u'if you re ready for the consequence  do whatever ', u'if you re going to cry about the consequence  control the action right now ', u'based on this  now you came to food ', u'see the food consumption has been looked at very carefully in this country ', u'if you just bring this back  the world will be healthy  do you understand ', u'here  we have identified different type of people ', u'what they should eat ', u'if you re doing menial jobs  how you should eat ', u'if you re doing trading  how you should eat ', u'if you re into spiritual process  how you should eat ', u'if you re into education  how you should eat ', u'why this is is each person needs a different type of building of the body ', u'you want to run hundred meters next to mr  bolt ', u'what kind of food you should eat ', u'you just want to work in delhi  what kind of food you should eat ', u'you want to think in a certain way  what kind of food you d  you should eat ', u'for all these  we have very clear prescriptions ', u'now when it comes to food ', u'what it means is  we are taking another life  whatever that is', u'it may be plant life  animal life  whatever', u'you re taking another life ', u'ingesting it and you have to make it your life  ', u'that s the whole thing ', u'what is your life  what is that life  if you look at it ', u'all life on this planet is coming from the earth ', u'this body is also the same soil ', u'this is also same soil ', u'if there is a earthworm  that is also same soil', u'but see how it has become  how this has become ', u'how that has become ', u'if i give you  you like a mango or a banana ', u' mango ', u' mango  i know   you re ru', u'you re ruling the state right now  referring to the aam aadmi party', u'now  if you eat a mango  this mango becomes a woman in you ', u'if i eat a mango  the same mango becomes a man in me ', u'if a cow eats a mango  the same mango becomes a cow in the cow ', u'why is this happening ', u'there is a certain information or software in you', u'whatever you eat it transforms it into a woman ', u'if i eat  it transforms into a man ', u'if a cow eats  that becomes a cow ', u'so every life is happening the way it is happening', u'because of a certain dimension of information', u'or in modern terminology  let s call it software ', u'there is a certain software  which is an arrangement of information ', u'now  the idea is to eat as simple a software as possible ', u'if you eat that kind of life  which is a very simple software ', u'your ability to override that software and make it entirely a part of you is very good ', u'as that software gets   complex ', u'more and more complex ', u'your ability to integrate it goes down ', u'so  especially if it s a creature which has some sense of thought and emotion ', u'if it has emotion  then you should not eat it ', u'this is the understanding ', u'an animal  which has any emotion ', u'displays certain emotions', u'especially if it displays emotion which is near to human emotion ', u'you should not eat it', u'because it will not integrate itself ', u'that animal nature will start manifesting itself ', u'or in other words  in india ', u'today maybe in cities people do not know ', u'you see in the villages ', u'people have very intimate relationship with a cow ', u'they have drunk the milk of that cow ', u'their children are drinking the milk of that cow ', u'there is a very deep relationship ', u'if you do not know this  cow is one creature ', u'if something happens to you and you are in some kind of grief or misery ', u'you don t have to be near the cow ', u'wherever the cow is in your house ', u'it will   it ll start shedding tears for you ', u'you know  i ve seen this with my eyes  i couldn t believe  ', u'when somebody is dead in the house it  what does a cow know ', u'it is somewhere  simply tears flowing ', u'so when it s  has such deep emotions ', u'if you kill it  it s like killing a human being ', u'it s murder or it s cannibalism ', u'so because of that   this is not a faith thing ', u'this is not a religious thing ', u'we thought this is a fundamental sense ', u'why  when we are hungry  why can t i cut you up and eat you ', u'what s wrong  ', u'what s wrong  i m asking ', u' but what you re saying should be about many more animals than just the cow ', u' yes  yes of course ', u' and when it becomes about only the cow ', u'then there is a  there is certainly a perception', u' i  it is not', u'  that it is a political decision or a religious decision ', u' no  no  i am not talking about the  whatever the laws that are happ', u' this is not about people getting up and saying ', u' it s cruel to be  to be a meat eater ', u'that would be a different argument ', u' hmm  i am not even talking about cruelty ', u'even cutting a plant is cruel  in my experience', u'but you have to do it ', u'but if you are conscious of it  you will do it to the minimum possible extent ', u'not do it wantonly  that s the whole thing ', u'now  about this political ban about cow slaughter or whatever ', u'this has many things ', u'one thing is there is a sensitivity ', u'once you drink milk from the cow  she is like your mother ', u'killing your mother and eating her up is something', u'people cannot digest in this country ', u'still eighty percent of the people belong to that category', u'and they re  they re hugely', u'there s a huge emotion ', u'such a emotion  which because they ve always been made to be docile in a certain way ', u'they have not violently  reacted to it', u'but in some places it has happened ', u'in villages and other places ', u'there is already a beef ban in many villages just by norm ', u'not by any law  that you don t bring these kind of  things into the village ', u'i am not saying you must ban it or not ban it ', u'i am saying the sensitivities of your population  you', u'without considering  you can t go do this blatantly ', u'because it is growing ', u'it s becoming a growing business ', u'india is becoming a major exporter of beef  that s not right ', u'even if somebody ate something  it is up to them ', u'it s their personal taste  whatever', u'but now you re promoting it and you re making it grow ', u'there is serious concern but our people don t express it ', u'our people don t go out on the street and not going to kill anybody', u'because they killed a cow ', u'so ban is not what is needed ', u'more education was needed rather than banning ', u' but you haven t spoken to what happens when faith', u'faith repeatedly seems to come into conflict with individual liberty', u'by the banning of books ', u'there were people killed in paris', u'because they were seen to have mocked ', u'you know of the prophet mohammed and so on ', u' see', u' so where does this end ', u'where do we stop violence and politics in the name of religion ', u' if you  if you want that to stop  you must understand this ', u'you re saying   today  today  it s not today ', u'in the last 2 000 years  this is the history of the world ', u'continuously it s happening all over the world ', u' so is that bombers are a new phenomenon ', u' well  you ve forgotten about the crusades and the other things ', u'which have not been reported in history  ', u'hundreds of millions of people have been killed in the name of god  all right ', u'it s new to us here  but even here ', u'thousands  hundreds and thousands have been slaughtered in northern part of india', u'just because the faith that they belonged to when the invasions happened ', u'nobody writes about it because we never took the pen and wrote ', u'somebody wrote history for us the way they like it ', u'because all history is sponsored by kings ', u'they wrote the history the way they want', u'and they said they are great emperors', u'but what they did was absolutely terrible ', u'so you need to understand  faith is a new thing to us ', u'when i say new ', u'in this country which has 12 15 000 years of history behind us ', u'1 000 years is new for us ', u'we ve still not come to terms with it ', u'we re still struggling with it ', u'but struggling within ourselves ', u'not creating a struggle on the street because that s not our nature', u'because here always we ve  been drilled into us ', u'whatever you do there ll be a consequence for you ', u'even if you come back another life  another life  it won t leave you ', u'it ll come back to you  tch  this has been told', u'this controls people  this is a', u'this is a tremendous technology  please understand this ', u'and it s not simply a fake thing  it is a real thing ', u'everything that you think  feel  act  there is a consequence ', u'not because there is somebody thinking he must give  gift', u'give you a reward or a punishment ', u'it happens in your own chemistry ', u' how do we keep faith ', u'which you say is new to us  separate from politics ', u'you have  you have  in the past for example ', u'i remember when anna hazare was lodging his anti corruption movement ', u'you did come and applaud it', u'but you said that the lokpal was not some magic wand ', u'i remember you saying that ', u'do you believe that we are seeing a dangerous cocktail of faith and politics', u'getting more and more mixed up ', u' see  it is happening ', u'i m not saying no', u'but it s much less than ever before ', u' really ', u' yes ', u' it seems to be much more than ever before ', u' no  that s because of you  ', u'that s because', u'that s because if  if ten people get beheaded in some remote part of iraq ', u'you make sure the blood spills into my sitting room ', u'because of that ', u'otherwise  you re sitting here now ', u'today  let s say 1 000 years ago ', u'we were sitting here ', u'1 000 people got killed in iraq ', u'we will sit here peacefully thinking world is going really great ', u'', u'spring time  ', u'everything is nice ', u'so  this is because the dissemination of information ', u'if ten people get killed somewhere  it s a huge thing', u'because it comes into our sitting rooms  bedrooms  dining room ', u'everywhere there is a television ', u'so it pours into our homes ', u'so it is happening ', u'so  this is good because even a small thing looks magnified now in people s experience', u'but this has been happening always ', u'it s happening at its lowest level now ', u'here and there it spurts up  which needs to be controlled for sure ', u'but what i see is ', u'for the first time ', u'for the very first time in the history of humanity ', u'even if you', u'the numbers are not qualified', u'because the population has increased ', u'even in terms of percentages of people ', u'how many people can think for themselves today is huge', u'compared to what it was a hundred years ago or five hundred years ago', u'or 1 000 years ago or 10 000 years ago ', u'all these centuries ', u'there would be one man in the village who thinks for you ', u'who reads for you ', u'who writes for you ', u'you just have to do what you have to do  simple things ', u'today  everybody is able to think for himself or herself ', u'now  human intellect is blossoming ', u'i do not say it is blossoming in the right direction ', u'with the right sense ', u'no ', u'insanely it is blossoming ', u'it doesn t matter  insanity will happen for some time ', u'people will come to their senses ', u'when something is new they ll go crazy  after some time they ll come to senses ', u'once human intellect blossoms sufficiently on the planet ', u'then this looking upward for well being will not make sense ', u'believe me ', u'right now  from looking upward ', u'slowly the world is tilting for', u'in pursuit of human well being  people were looking heavenward ', u'still many are  that s different ', u'but a whole lot of people have started looking outward ', u'so if you look heavenward  hallucinations will happen ', u'wars will happen', u'because my heaven and your heaven different  you know ', u'none of the heavens have anything for women ', u'you better know that  ', u' i am definitely going to hell   anyway', u' so you believe in heaven and hell  ', u' i was being facetious ', u'i was being facetious ', u' let me finish this ', u' i was being facetious ', u'i don t know if there is somebody up there ', u' that s fine  that is fine  i', u' is it a force  is it energy  is that inside me ', u' no  i m saying this', u'this thing about looking heavenward is slowly going away', u'and in pursuit of well being  people are looking outward ', u'this is ripping the planet apart ', u'human pursuit of well being is just destroying the planet ', u'now  the fundamentals of what we are transmitting', u'the fundamentals of this culture ', u'which is essentially rooted in the yogic culture ', u'what you call as indian culture or hindu culture is essentially a pure yogic science ', u'in the form of culture ', u'it finds many colors and distortions ', u'which is what you re seeing as the hindu culture or indian culture ', u'whatever you want to call it ', u' but they re not interchangeable terms ', u' why ', u' because we re  a multi religious country with many different cultures ', u'  we have  i want you to ', u'i want you to understand the word hindu does not signify a religion ', u'you ask them do they worship one god if they are hindus ', u'in the same family  they re worshipping twenty five gods  ', u'they don t', u'they don t know which is the god ', u'so they re making sure worship everything  ', u'just in case something will hit  okay  ', u'now  the word hindu means the land between himalayas and indusagara ', u'this land  this subcontinent is hindu ', u'all people who are born here are considered hindu', u'because it s a geographical identity ', u'i know there s a whole political issue  if i speak like this ', u'they say   oh  he s hindu ', u' no  i mean people will tell you you re echoing the rss  chief  ', u' i don t know what he said  i have not', u' he said all indians are hindus and there was a huge', u' okay  i am not', u'  political outcry over that ', u' okay  all indians live between himalayas and indian ocean  ', u' that s okay ', u' those who want to jump into the ocean', u' that s okay  ', u' if you live   see  this is a dialectical culture ', u'it expresses things in a certain way ', u'between himalayas and indian ocean if you live  you are a hindu ', u'if you jump into the ocean and cross  you are a lanka  okay  ', u'so  i don t know what is the struggle about this ', u'this is because there is such a narrow understanding of this ', u'this is the debate which we have to change in the country', u'because somebody has absolute belief systems ', u'we are trying to compare that', u'to a culture where there is no such thing as belief ', u'we have not ever been believers ', u'we ve always been seekers ', u'this is a land where the highest value has never been god ', u'always liberation ', u'mukti', u'freedom is the highest goal ', u'god has never been the highest goal  ', u'so you  you put this in the same box as something ', u'which just believes this is it or you re dead  ', u'unfortunate ', u'that s not the way to look at it ', u'this is what we have to bring back  if we really value human freedom ', u'you must bring back this seeking for liberation ', u' i want to be free  not just from others but from myself and my god and my heaven and everything ', u'because god has never been the goal in this culture ', u'god is just another tool ', u'when i use the word tool for a god ', u'people get very hurt ', u'they say   sadhguru  don t say that  it hurts us ', u'i say   that s okay  you come to the ashram ', u'i ll give you some plumbing job   all right  see', u' that ll hurt more  ', u' no  no  no   no spanner  no winch  nothing ', u'use your fingers  nails  teeth  whatever ', u'three days later  nails will be gone ', u'half the teeth will be gone ', u'then i will give you a spanner ', u'will you worship the spanner or no   ', u'we are who we are', u'as  as human beings ', u'we are who we are', u'only because of our ability to use a tool ', u'otherwise you are not even good as a dog ', u'you can t even fight a dog  isn t it ', u' so you re against organized religion ', u'quite clearly ', u'if god is just a tool and', u'faith is not the same as spirituality', u'  no  i  see  no  no  i m not  i m not saying i m against this or that ', u'all i m saying is i want human beings to come to this much', u'if you know something you know it ', u'if you don t know something you don t know it ', u'everything that you do not know you believe  ', u'this is a dangerous thing ', u'now  the fight on the planet is', u'not between good and evil  this and that  no  ', u'one man s versus another man s belief ', u'i m saying why the hell do you believe anything ', u'because you re essentially not straight enough to admit ', u' i really don t know ', u' i don t know  people can t fight ', u'i don t know  you don t know   can we fight ', u' i know  is a fight ', u' i do not know  is never a fight ', u' i do not know  is a way of seeking ', u'if we do not establish this seeking in every human being ', u'that every human being is longing to know', u'whether outside or inside  whatever ', u'you are', u'because this is the nature of human intelligence ', u'it can t sit quiet ', u'it can only sit quiet if you freeze it with belief system ', u'if you seal it with belief system  it can sit quiet ', u'otherwise the very nature of this intelligence is it wants to know ', u' okay  we re almost at the end so i think i m going take a few questions ', u'just two three minutes of questions ', u'i m seeing lots of hands go up ', u'the lady behind you ', u'yes please ', u' namaskaram  sadhguru  in one of your videos ', u'you say that the problem with the world is that', u'most people lack the intensity ', u'   ', u' most people lack the necessary intensity ', u' mhmm ', u' and then you say the way is dhyana ', u'so intensity is more associated to fierceness in personality', u'and dhyana is more associated to calmness ', u'so they re somehow counterintuitive ', u'can you elaborate a little ', u' people think peace means rest in peace ', u'because their idea of peace is death ', u'peace can be very intense ', u'peace can be tremendously intense', u'because peace means the reverberations of life have become subtle and intense ', u'action means reverberations of life are not so subtle ', u'it is at a certain level ', u'so peace happens not because', u'peace may happen if somebody is dead', u'but to be alive and peaceful means', u'you need to be highly intense state of energy ', u'otherwise you can t be peaceful ', u'the reason why most people who don t have any problems as such ', u'you know after all they re trying to earn a living ', u'reproduce and bring up their children and die one day ', u'just for that they re freaking simply because of lack of intensity ', u'because life is happening at a low ebb ', u'naturally everything is a problem ', u'if it rises a little bit  suddenly you have a little clearer view of everything ', u'for this  you need a higher intensity of energy within you', u'and the yogic system is essentially focused towards that ', u'dhyana does not mean    no  ', u' okay  let s take the next question ', u'here  right here in the front row  yeah ', u' sadhguru  what i get from isha s philosophy ', u'if i may say there is  is', u'that you need to see internally ', u'in your interiority ', u'you need to fix it internally before fixing your external situations ', u'but is it also not right', u'is it also not very important to do the right thing externally  you know ', u'just to make myself more clear you know ', u'if i be more precise', u' no  no  i m clear  i get the question  ', u'why  do i look so dumb  ', u' let s say you know  if somebody', u' i got it ', u' yeah ', u' i got it ', u' if somebody is born', u' i got the question  ', u' isha s philosophy is not about looking internally or externally ', u'it is just that if you re looking for mangoes ', u'you look up the tree ', u'you don t dig the earth  all right  ', u'but if you re looking how to plant a mango tree ', u'then you dig the earth ', u'you re looking for mangoes if you dig the earth  will you find it  i m asking ', u'so if you  inner things  you must look inward ', u'outer things you must look outward ', u'there is no such philosophy  ', u' look out or look in ', u'wherever the damn thing is ', u'look there  ', u' like you know  shankaran pillai went for a job interview ', u'and they asked him ', u' which is further  mumbai or moon ', u'he thought profoundly and then said   mumbai ', u'they said   how do you say this ', u'he said   i can see the moon  i can t see mumbai   ', u' okay  last question  yeah ', u' namaskaram sadhguru  i just want to ask', u' hold the mike closer to you ', u' yeah  i just want to ask you that', u'everybody s perception of good and bad is different', u'and what do you think if we start manifesting our own good and bad ', u'what ll be the state of the society ', u' hmm  maybe you won t have power tonight  ', u'i think i already made this clear ', u'the biggest problem with the world is there re too many good people ', u'not enough sensible people ', u'sense is life specific  okay ', u'goodness need not be life oriented ', u'goodness may be going to heaven ', u'and the moment  ', u'i want you to understand this dangerous concept ', u'people don t address this  ', u'the moment you believe', u'suppose i believe there is heaven and it s a beautiful place', u'and you can live in the company of gods ', u'should i send you there today or no ', u'if i really care for you  i m saying  ', u'yes ', u'if i really care for you and if i believe there s a great place ', u'should i send you there or not ', u'this is a dangerous thing  do you understand ', u'if you stretch it to its logical end  it s a really dangerous thing ', u'the moment i believe there is a fantastic place up there ', u'i really love you and i want you to go there  you know  ', u'tch  yes  ', u' okay  let me just end by asking you something that we haven t spoken', u'about and then i ll hand it over to chiki ', u'you said you love machines ', u' i didn t say i love them  ', u' okay  you like machines ', u' i', u' or they re useful ', u' they work ', u' have our lives been overtaken by gadgets ', u' not mine ', u' no ', u' definitely not  i use all the gadgets', u'but they don t overtake me ', u'these are fantastic things in our life ', u'things  see  in every way ', u'compared to how a human being was  let s say hundred years ago ', u'you re almost superhuman ', u'tch  hundred years ago  if i could just pick up something from my pocket', u'and talk to somebody in america right now ', u'i would be superhuman ', u'why superhuman ', u'if i said  i m god  people would have believed me ', u'hundred years ago ', u'five hundred years ago  if i just had a light bulb ', u'i would have become god on this planet ', u'i want you to know  look at the things we have today ', u'we are really superhuman ', u'once this kind of capability has come to us ', u'little more sense has to rise ', u'little more awareness and consciousness stu', u'has to arise ', u'if this doesn t happen ', u'this capability will turn against us ', u'this is what you re saying ', u'now gadgets are freaking people  why ', u'it s a simple thing ', u'you  if you want to use it  you can use it or you can keep it aside ', u'because you are in a compulsive state ', u'if you start using a cell phone  you can t stop it ', u'even in your sleep you re texting ', u'see the boy is ', u'he s in a  he s not with me  he s in  looking at me in the screen  ', u'now  this is the same thing ', u'if food is good  if you start eating you don t know when to stop ', u'if you start drinking  you don t know when to stop ', u'if you start doing something  you don t know when to stop ', u'the same thing  it is not about the gadget ', u'it is not about the food ', u'it is just that there is not enough consciousness ', u'there is compulsiveness ', u'everything is happening compulsively ', u'instead of addressing the root  you re trying to kill the gadget ', u'gadget is a fantastic thing ', u'every damn gadget has enhanced our life in a huge way  isn t it ', u'don t curse the gadgets ', u'it is just that compulsiveness has to go ', u' well  on that note  i will say thank you for provoking us ', u'as always  a pleasure  to have you ', u'a pleasure   ', u'let s have a big round of applause for sadhguru here  ']
