 the most beautiful thing about time is if you do something it passes by if you do nothing it passes by if you are joyful it passes by if you are miserable it passes by its absolutely just no matter who you are how you are for everyboy it passes at the same speed only thing is our experience of the time could be different depending upon how intensely we live or how slack we are if youre very slack with life it looks like time is passing by very slowly if youre very intense time just flies by but in reality time is happening to all of us at the same pace these cycles of time whether its minutes or hours or days or months or years that go by these cycles of time anything thats cyclical is naturally repetitive but anything that is cyclical also has a centrifuge or a centrifugal force a force which is always trying to go away at a tangent from the circle if you ride this centrifugal force of time we say youre spiritual if you are caught up in the cycle of time then thats being material if youre crushed by the cycles of time then we say you are a suffering creature it is the same cycle either you can be crushed by the cycle or you can trapped in the cycle or you can ride the cycle to ride the cycles of time not to be trapped in it definitely not to be crushed by it time is crushing experience for a lot of people hmm yes anything cyclical has this ability that it can crush you or it can trap you or you can ride it in the yogic way of looking at things we see time time is referred to as kala kala means both time and space kala means darkness darkness means that which does not stop light you understand what im saying if there is light going by you wont see it only if its stopped by something you see it so that which does not stop light is called darkness so that which does not stop light is empty space so both space and time are referred to as kala because they are not seen as two different entities only because there is time space is possible because there is time you can move from point a to point b so there is space if there was no time there was no way to move the general perception is because there is space there is time but i dont see it that way because there is time there is space now there is time which happens because of cycles the planet spins once its a day the moon goes around the planet its a month the planet goes around the sun here we are today  the cycles of time are one dimension of time theres another dimension of time which is not which is beyond the cyclical nature this we call as the great time its called the mahakala there is time and there is greater time even when there are no cycles there is time but where there is no cyclical movement there is no physical happening everything thats physical in the universe from what is atomic to what is cosmic everything is cyclical if there are no cycles happening there is no physical possible when i said if you take a tangent or if you take the centrifugal to ride away from the cycles of time that means being spiritual its in this context that we know the cycles of time only because of physical reality if we could measure if we could measure what is the speed of an electron around the proton and neutron we could keep time atomic time but a bit too much for us so we measured the planets how much time it takes to go around the sun they said its a year we went little further down to days and hours and minutes and seconds but all of them are cycles of the physical existence if there is no physical existence we would not know anything thats cyclical if we did not know what is cyclical movement we would not know the cyclical nature of the time but before existence manifested in its physical nature there was time this is called mahakala that is an eternal space youre not watching my words im saying an eternal space when there was no movement when everything was still there was time but nothing cyclical happening that dimension of time into which everything dissolved and from which everything sprang up when certain energy touched it it took to cyclical movement when cyclical movement happened physical happened when physical happened we could measure time otherwise time was just space so the word kala means both time and space sadhguru we came for a party  and here youre going at us like this  is it it is important to know or rather its important to touch and experience a dimension which is not cyclical in nature because what is cyclical is inevitably repetitive what is cyclical inevitably runs itself out at some point it runs itself down anything thats cyclical cannot be forever because it needs a certain amount of kinetic energy which is going to expend itself when a human being touches a dimension which is not cyclical in nature suddenly there is a new quality a quality which is beyond all qualities  not good not bad not this not that simply like existence theres nothing high about it nothing low about it its just that you have moved from the surface to the source not that it solves all your problems its just that you wont know what is a problem  this i said something about the india situation and this quote is making rounds even reached the prime minister and he was laughing about it i said for every solution there is a problem  just see  for every solution somebody has a problem isnt it  for people may think for every problem there is a solution but when you dont see any problems when you see only solutions some people have problems with the solutions  i don't know what shall i do what shall i do with myself which is all and nothing at once what shall i do with myself which is me and you at once what shall i do is this a problem or is this a solution there may be a space where there are no problems and no solutions just existence for someone who pops out of nothing and pops out into nothing what is the problem and what is a solution im asking  hello you popped up from nothing youre gonna pop out into nothing in this little space and time what is the problem and what is the solution i want you to figure this out  hello what is the problem hmm  theres really no problem no solution actually but there are so many problems  sadhguru we dont know where you are living  where i am living there are so many problems  i am also living among the kind of people that youre living with  yes same sort  the question is just what are you rooted into if your rooting is just your physical body some things are problems some things are solutions if youre rooted into a psychological framework everything is a problem  if youre rooted into the existence nothing is a problem nothing is a solution everything is an experience of life hmm everything is an experience if i die tomorrow that is also a very good experience we dont wish it tomorrow but if it comes that is also an experience hmm you dont like it whether you like it or not it happens yes  yes  whether you like it or not it happens not that were wishing it tomorrow but if it happens tomorrow what the hell  we dont want it tomorrow still got miles to go before i sleep miles to go before i sleep   we dont know how many miles you will go but if you look at life in its full depth and dimension life is a certain amount of space if you look at life in a linear fashion life is a certain amount of time if you look at life from your psychological perspective life is a certain number of problems every day im meeting all sorts of people thousands of them how many varieties of problems they have means its unbelievable for sure for every solution there is a problem  birth is a problem death is a problem in between series of problems serial inventors of problems one cycle is ending a new year is coming its a choice that you have to make are you going to invest your thought and emotion and energy in making up problems or making up solutions or simply enjoying life for what it is its a choice that one has to make oh this is my resolution i wont make any more problems  to make resolutions first you need a constitution do you have a constitution hello you dont have a constitution no like a nation has a constitution a religion has a constitution too one advantage of the constitution of the nation is we can amend it periodically the constitution of the religions cannot be amended its fixed  any change means violence will happen  if you suggest an amendment they will kill you that is their amendment  the national constitution constitutions which make nations it is open to debate and amendment im asking you you as a person do you have a constitution no no no you have what you like what you dont like thiss what i will do thiss i wont do im a morning person im a evening person  im a whatsapp person im a email person im a facebook person  there are constitutions  individual constitutions maybe not written down but its there isnt it if you can pass a resolution there must be a constitution if there is no constitution how do you pass a resolution about it so there is once you have a constitution you are not a life you are an institution if youre living in an institution you know what it means  it means youre a nutcase  yes no no no not everybody either youre a nutcase or youre a spiritual aspirant  yes you are a seeker of sanity or youre a seeker of liberation  one of these things means you live in a institution so what resolution should i take for the new year all resolutions are impositions where there is no consciousness where there is no awareness to know life from the from the aliveness of what it is you wanna fix it if you pass a resolution today in some way youre making sure that you will not be aware for the next one year because awareness means a spontaneous response to life momenttomoment as a resolution means fixed prefixed if you prefix your life whether its done by you or done by somebody else if if your government passes a resolution  all of you must hang upside down in india we would say a tamarind tree here where shall we hang you from tch whats the famous tree from which they hang people no particular tree hmm where to find a oak tree  hmm where to find a big oak tree to hang from its difficult to find them in india we say a tamarind tree for a particular reason  so lets say your government passes a resolution that all of you must hang upside down from a tree whatever tree  well give you the choice of the tree  will you suffer this will you protest this will you rebel against it or no hmm  yes  yes whether your government passes the resolution or you pass the resolution its not any different youre trying to achieve something by force anything that you try to do by force feels like youre hanging upside down yes or no you want to be like this but you want to do this you will feel like youre hanging upside down when you hang upside down you will feel like rebelling against it so naturally within three days your resolutions will become dissolutions  otherwise you suffer hanging upside down very few suffer the entire year some will dissolve this in three days some in three weeks some in three months but the very fact that they need one more resolution by the year end is a proof that did not did not last the year so there is no need to take any resolutions but a resolution is made because you want to do something that you naturally dont not inclined towards but the simple thing is are you naturally inclined to be joyful or miserable  joyful  that was only five people  are you naturally inclined to be joyful or miserable  joyful  the little ones  joyful  so you can consciously you can make an attempt to be conscious that joyful is my natural inclination so how joyful will i be in the coming year just keep accounts hmm see lot of people whore doing business they think theyre keeping accounts only for the sake of irs  no no you keep accounts not for the sake of irs because if you do not keep accounts you do not know whether youre making profit or loss thats the idea of accounts isnt it whether youre moving forward or backward to know this you need an account book why dont you keep an account book at the end of the day just check am i little more joyful today than yesterday tch if you had done this since you were five years of age you would have been ecstatic by now profit side  became like this because you never kept accounts one day you checked when it became very acute then you see you are in a big loss  every day every month just keep accounts am i becoming more joyful or less joyful therere only two things how joyful are you and how much joy do you give to people around you this you can keep accounts hmm if you keep accounts of this people are keeping accounts of their money as if theyre gonna carry it with them the real wealth of life is how joyful you are how wonderful is your experience of life joy is not a goal by itself but its a necessary ambiance for life if you dont set this one ambiance then whatever you have is just going waste hmm you may have health thats going waste because  there are more people on this planet whore healthy and miserable than unhealthy and miserable at least if youre at least if youre unhealthy you got a good enough excuse for your misery hmm youre healthy and miserable there is no excuse i want you to just understand this its just not smart to be miserable  hmm this happened a lady was driving tch and then she had a flat tire she had never really done this  this changing tire business but she read the instruction manual she put the jack and lifted up the car she undid the wheel with great difficulty she pulled out the heavy wheel from the boot and was trying to fix it and these four nuts that she had she had kept it in the hub cap and with her high heels she was struggling and she stepped on the hub cap and all the four nuts flew in different directions so she put the new tire but she had no nuts tch then she was cursing and wondering and miserable what the hell to do now and she was little nervous because she was hearing all kinds of noises from a mental institution which was across the street  then on the third floor there was a young man looking out of the window watching this lady then he said hey lady look here all you need to do is take oneone nut out of the three wheels and put the three nuts on this you can drive to the gas station with three nuts you can drive no problem she did that and she got the car down on the road then she looked up at him and said youre so smart why are you here  he said i may be nuts but im not stupid  its all right to be little crazy but you dont have to be stupid all the socalled smart people whove become  like theyre practicing a posture for their grave  you know when i look at lot of people i think theyre practicing  theyre doing pretty well  but what they dont understand is it doesnt take practice when you die it happens  yes  yes  do you think you need to practice no  because you cant improve death with practice but you can improve life with practice yes or no  yes  however you do life you can still do it better yes  yes  but death happens super efficiently for everybody you cant improve upon that you think you can improve no you dont have to practice your final posture right now  itll come naturally believe me its not like life therere no difficulties there itll come very naturally you will do perfectly well in the grave  you dont have to have any doubt it doesnt need any preparation when you die you will get it hmm but now with life there is so much to do and more how much ever you do theres something more to do about life isnt it if you want to be at it the fundamental ambiance is that youre joyful otherwise you will get this tremendously intelligent idiotic question  to be or not to be  yes intellectually seems very profound but its the most idiotic question you dont have to decide not to be it will happen there were many idiots like you countless number of idiots like you on this planet whore gone they dont have to worry about to be or not to be now anyway theyre not to be this is our time on this planet yes  yes  this is our time on this planet what are we going to do thats the question are we going to make this into an exuberant joyful wonderful planet or we going to make this into a miserable horrible planet this is our time we are free to do either way the choice is yours i wont tell you take a resolution that you will make this into a wonderful planet there is no such thing the natural inclination of life is for pleasantness if you choose to be very pleasant within yourself pleasant things will happen if youre feeling horrible within you and you try to do wonderful things then i want you to understand  the worst tyrants on the planet those who topped the baddie list historically ill pick up the worst of the lot you take somebody like adolf hitler or benito mussolini they really believed they are going to create a wonderful world you know this they had a dream of an ideal world when you have horrible things going within you and you go at the world with very energetically what you will create is a horrendous reality before you touch the world if you want to clean somebodys face your hands must be clean isnt it yes or no  yes  your hands are not clean you try to touch this  thiss not gonna work so before you touch the outside world this much you must do to with yourself that you are pleasant when you are pleasant whatever you touch will become pleasant you are unpleasant but you have good intentions it is no good i want you to understand right now in the world one situation that is happening in certain parts of the world which almost everybody in the world sees as the most horrible things that can happen they believe theyre creating gods own kingdom yes or no  yes  they onehundred percent believe you may question their intelligence you cannot question their integrity because theyre willing to die for it when a man is willing to die for something you cannot question his integrity isnt it you can question his intelligence and judgment but you cannot question his integrity because when i stake my life you must know i mean it  isnt it im not playing fool with it it means more to me than my life yes or no  yes  i want you to know you have anger and hatred going within you but you want to create a wonderful world  what happens the consequence of that is a horrendous reality its not by intention that the world will change it is by your consciousness that the world will change how you are within yourself if we dont fix this one thing we will have intentions and intentions the worst things have happened on the planet with good intentions not with bad intentions yes or no  yes  the most horrendous things have happened with very good intentions so what intention you have is not important what is your inner nature this is important every action that humanbeings are doing in their life knowingly or unknowingly is in pursuit of their well being and you know you feel well only when you are joyful hello yes you feel really well only when you are joyful isn't it or in other words every single action that human beings perform is in pursuit of their happiness or joy if they were joyful by their own nature every action that you perform would become conscious instead of being compulsive isnt it this is all you have to do to yourself this year the coming year and the coming coming year and for the rest of your life you just have to keep accounts from yesterday to today am i little more joyful am i you dont even have to worry about giving joy if youre joyful you will spread joy yes will you keep accounts im asking  yes  or shall i set irs upon you  do you need enforcement  most societies have been run for a long time by enforcement so if theres nobody to enforce   no thats not what happens if there is nobody to enforce anything you become joyful isnt it  i want you to understand this  the different between a resolution and moving towards the natural inclination of life if there is nobody enforcing anything upon you do you become miserable or joyful  joyful  so you dont have to enforce any resolutions upon yourself just little tools to make sure that you dont sink just keeping accounts daily every day before you go to bed you must check whether youre little more joyful today than yesterday okay if you keep this up by the time youre thirty you will be ecstatic  when i was  when i was just twentyfive tch i simply sat down with my eyes closed every cell in my body was dripping ecstasy nameless ecstasies then i realized this is it nothing to be done if you dont mess with your mind youre ecstatic the fool that i was i made a plan  in twoandahalf to three years time im going to make the entire world ecstatic because theres nothing to do if you simply sit here  you know thirtyfive years   i have not lost it a few people have gotten it yes quite a few people have gotten it but still not the world  making some estimates and on an average in the last three years time we should be touching nearly hundred million people a year but still thats not the world  no no no dont dont dont enjoy my failures  my idea of the world is 73 billion people tch hundred million is not a success it looks like im destined to die a failure but ill die a blissful failure because me being blissful is not dependent upon the results of my actions  my actions are rooted in my blissfulness this is how life needs to be conducted that your actions are rooted in your joyfulness and blissfulness that joy is not a result of something that you do the moment it is a result of something that you do it will fly away in no time because our actions in the world not always are they successful hmm however well you do it yes or no however well you do it not always are they successful our actions are subject to various realities many forces have to come together for the success of any action not always they will fall together so if your joy if your way of being is enslaved to the success of your activity then you being joyful is a very remote possibility and above all what will happen is when you perform actions if they dont succeed if youre going to become miserable after a couple of burns then you will shrink you will see how to restrict your life to minimal activity so that you will enjoy maximum success if you cripple yourself you know if you cripple yourself you can participate in a race with people suppose you have only one leg then you participate in a race with somebody who does not have both the legs and of course you win this is what most people are trying to do the moment there is fear of suffering of failure what you will do is cripple yourself restrict your activity only when failure doesnt matter that you can go through your failure blissfully you will do everything that you can do who cares whether it happens or not we will do it and well do it well if it happens its great if it doesnt happen its very great because we can do it all over again  joy is not a consequence of life or activity of life joy is a natural ambiance which is necessary if you have to tomorrow morning if you have to wake up and want to do something you no you need to have some joy in you  otherwise to be or not to be  will it come or not suppose you wake up and you tomorrow morning youre bereft of joy nothing in you youll wonder why am i here yes or no one day one twentyfour hours completely joyless will you wonder what the hell im doing here yes or no  yes  because this is the nature of life if this life has to blossom it needs the ambiance of joy so we have given you the tools  to live joyfully you must keep accounts hmm  yes   yes  i got it  before they serve food and music is ready and the party is ready i dont want to take any more time if there is a question that you can't go into the new year without being answered if there is such a question  okay not that you must ask a question if there is such a question okay no it works only if you speak   namaskaram sadhguru  mhmm   i have thousands of burning questions  but i thank you immensely for giving me this opportunity to ask one question how do i get rid of some unconscious bad habits in my life when i see that i have overcome some of those bad habits i see that it comes back again in my life how do i just totally get rid of this and become free out of it  see you must understand that please there is no such thing as good habit and bad habit all habits are bad  because habit means youre unconscious you think only bad habits are unconscious no even the socalled good habits habit means you have learned to function in an automated way that means you dont do things consciously for example is brushing your teeth in the morning a good habit or a bad habit  even you i thought you would be free from a habit  there are two ways of brushing your teeth because youve been regimented to brush your teeth you get up and ffff   or because you wake up youre very sensitive if you open your mouth youre conscious enough  most of the time youre not conscious enough only other people know  this is a very strange thing there is the apparatus the olfactory apparatus which smell which have a sense of smell right here  above your mouth  but you dont get it others get it five feet away  that means youre unconscious isn't it yes  yes  if youre conscious you would still brush your teeth till you come to such a place when you open your mouth in the morning it smells like fragrance you become like a flower till that happens you must consciously brush  if you consciously brush on different days or different mornings it may need different length or different amount of brushing not every day brushing is same requirement but because youre regimented three minutes i must wear my teeth out  if you were conscious on a particular day you would brush as it is necessary for that day thats how it should be on a particular day you would eat as it is necessary for the body you would sleep as it is necessary for the body you would do everything consciously but now it's a habit everything is a habit what time you should go to bed what time you should wake up what you should eat what you should not eat  everything by prescription this is called slavery your doctor tells you or your slave master tells you what you should eat today i dont see what's the difference why is it that you do not know what this body needs today because no consciousness everything by regimentation by habit habit is regimentation isn't it it's only by regimentation you become habitual so in this you have also identified something as good habit and something as bad habit what to do is there something called as bad unconsciousness and good unconsciousness thats what youre saying when you say i have a good habit youre saying im unconscious in a nice way  it's like  saying im dead in a nice way  because the fundamental difference between being alive and being dead is being conscious and being totally unconscious being partially unconscious is being partially dead as i earlier told you youre trying to practice the posture  and the state of what it means to be dead do not fix any kind of habit just see see the idea of withdrawing into retreats coming to a spiritual space is just this  to find space where you can do everything consciously when you were in a race you could not be conscious you got mad and you somehow fixed some habits through which you managed to go through your daily office routine when you come to a spiritual space this is what youre supposed to do  that you watch what is the requirement of your body what is the requirement of your mind what is the requirement of your emotion what is the requirement of your energy what does this life  need what does it naturally long for to consciously watch this once you consciously know that this is what it is longing for then there is no two ways about it otherwise you think youre on the spiritual path because of me thats a crime against me  yes  if youre unconscious its a crime against yourself but youre doing something that you think is spiritual because of me thats a crime against me tch you better do crime against yourself not against me  so how do i get rid of habits you dont have to get rid of habits it is like what youre asking is how do i get rid of my unconsciousness when you use the word un we are suggesting a nonexistence not an existence isn't it consciousness is when consciousness is not there that is called unconsciousness how to get rid of something that does not exist im saying youre playing a trick with yourself it's like suppose this this hall is dark how to get rid of this darkness kick it out hmm all of you together im sure you can kick out of the darkness you will get into an insane effort youve been on it hmm this insane effort to get rid of unconsciousness no to get rid of darkness you just have to light it up if you light it up darkness is gone because darkness is not an existence by itself it's just the absence of light similarly unconsciousness is not an existence of itself it is just absence of consciousness if you become conscious do you have to fight with unconscious hmm if youre conscious do you have to fight with unconscious habits  no  no so you need to work on consciousness to become conscious oh what should i do you should not do unconscious things  because the essence of life is being conscious you know that youre alive only because youre reasonably conscious isn't it yes or no  yes  youre fast asleep do you know youre dead or alive do you know  no  no why because youre not conscious when youre not conscious you do not even know whether youre dead or alive isn't it now you know that youre alive because youre somewhat conscious now we just have to raise the wick a little bit to become more conscious thats what were working on there are many things which has gathered inertia your physical body 30 drum in the morning your mind has got into its own habitual patterns thats why me torturing you with all this your energies have followed the requirement of body and mind and theyve gotten into their own patterns  that is why the sadhana the idea is to break the cycles of unconsciousness and become conscious when you become conscious it looks like youre in unknown terrain suddenly everything seems to be difficult when you were going habitually it looked like everything was easy but see when i  when i went into the coimbatore prison no i went there unqualified you know  when i went there to conduct a program  almost twentyfive twentyfour twentyfive years ago i just observed  this is something a whole lot of people are seeking in their life prison life because this is a place where somebody always opens the doors for you and they close it for you they turn off the lights for you they do everything for you you dont have to do anything  really food comes bang on time  always by the second im telling you tun means food is ready everything is great in this prison i thought this is a great place only thing is it's enforced but this is what a whole lot of people are seeking systems in their life yes when it is done to you you will suffer it im telling you  when it is done to you youll suffer it actually for a whole lot of people prison life is far more it is far more organized  what they dream of in their life it's far more efficient far more nutritious  and most of them are very fit and healthy but if you enter the prison there is suffering in the air not once  i have been there hundreds of times to various prisons  not once have i stepped out of the prison without tears in my eyes because there is suffering in the air the pain in the air is unbearable because one thing that a human being suffers most is lack of freedom  not lack of comfort not lack of wealth not lack of this and that once freedom is taken away a human being suffers immensely everything is correct prison life is far more comfortable than going to work and coming back getting stuck in the traffic going through all these problems you are a state guest you know  really if youre looking for a comfortable no surprises kind of life  if you suffer every little thing sh everything shocks you everything makes you go through stress and tension prison life is perfect  everything is in order no surprises everything is just right even the menu is written down  next seven days what's the menu it's there and it goes by that nothing more nothing more nothing less one bean more means somebody will be taken to task  everything is correct those who are looking for a correct life prison is the best place  but a human being will suffer immensely when everything is correct yes or no  yes  everything is correct but no freedom  people will suffer this immensely so you need to understand habit means you have caused a little prison of your own and you will suffer this after some time initially it looks like efficiency after some time it is imprisonment prison is in many ways an epitome of efficiency isn't it but efficiency is not what this life  is looking for this life  is looking for expansion this life  wants the freedom to expand always i was talking to one of this management specialists from america a very wellknown man  let me not mention the names so he was propounding all his management principles which if which looked like a prison cell to me  bringing order to everything so that it's efficient see there are two ways of looking at this there is a manicured garden which looks very perfect there is forest which looks like chaos but the manicured garden if you dont manage it for one month its finished theres no garden left a forest has managed itself for a million years and still going on which is more efficient which is more orderly  forest  forest is far more orderly and far more efficient but it is not fitting into your logical framework thats all this is what enlightenment means that from being a manicured garden you become a forest because it sustains upon itself it doesnt need anything from outside nobody need to water it nobody need to manure it nobody need to come and trim it everything happens within itself yes or no  yes  if you leave it for a million years itll still be there only if you meddle with it it may go away otherwise it will sustain itself because it is an efficiency of chaos we call something chaos not because it is inefficient we call something chaos because it doesnt fit in to our logical framework so habit means you have become a slave of your own logic and after some time the moment you form a habit it is unconscious isn't it so what you need to get rid of is not habits you have to become conscious if you become more conscious and youre not unconscious then there is no such thing as habit you will do what's right for you now so ninehundredandninetynine questions please live with it for 2017  all the best  namaskaram sadhguru thank you so much for this opportunity i have a question regarding the book and i wanted to know like if we read the book as ive read it and im doing the practices the practices in the book how do they help versus the programs that we have and if someones reading the book and doing the practices is that enough or what is that they need to do next   hey what did i do to deserve this hmm hmm whats your name  shashi  thank you   oh oh oh ho ho ho ho  isnt it a bit too early for flowers  thank you  these are slippers for the airplane  oh i must wear them on the airplane i usually dont walk i fly  thank you  thank you very much thank you very much   can i please say a poem  hmm  can i please say a poem  im sorry  can i please say a poem  oh yes please microphone please  theres a poem theyre going to recite  my heart is like a singing bird whose nest is in a watered shoe my heart is like an apple tree whose boughs are bound by thick sap fruit my heart is like a rainbow show that paddles in the sea my heart is gladder than all these because my love has come to me raise me days of silk and down covered in peacocks and doves and pea pomegranates and peacocks with one hundred eyes work it in gold and silver grapes and leaves and silver firty because the birthday of my life has come my love has come to me    what a sweet poem   im sorry  you know were washed away by we lost the question you know  okay okay practices practices   if only if i get to do that that would be amazing   im sorry  that was lovely the kids getting to hug you it was amazing   hmm what is that  the kids getting to hug you was amazing you know so its okay  but you dont have a sweet poem like her  oh when you said the book you know im supposed to finish this book before 3rd of january so im working on that book when you said the book  i was just thinking book book book because this book is bothering me for last few days im supposed to complete it by 3rd january  were writing a book on adiyogi im to give it to the publisher by 3rd january and so thats the book on my mind youre talking about the old book  old book okay  the practice that is taught in the inner engineering program needs twentyone minutes you need to sit in one place and do it it is of a different nature it is it is a process which can change to start with the chemistry of your system many of you have experienced this after a few months of practice if you look back and see all those littlelittle things which were so significant dont seem to bother you anymore theyre just gone simply because the chemistry has changed you know when chemistry changes things change  in whatever way you have known it but there are other dimensions to human chemistry that instead of being a volatile reactive chemistry can become a very selfcontained chemistry which is pleasant and on the practices in the book are not sitting down and doing practices you could be doing it anywhere you could be driving you could be working in your office you could be walking on the street and still be doing it theyre of that nature or in other words the practices in the book are just to bring a certain amount of consciousness the book did not have these practices to start with but when i travelled around in america everybody was talking about being mindful  then i saw by being mindful what they will do to themselves my entire work is to bring you to a certain sense of abandon that you can be here like youre not here if you sit here you dont even know whether your body is here if you sit like this first thing is you dont have a gender you dont even have a body so where is the question of a gender if you simply sit like this there is no time for you just look at this only because you have a body your body is keeping time hmm your legs are telling you how long youve been sitting yes or no  hmm  yes  suppose you had no legs you would have no sense of time if you had no back no sense of time at all if you had no body no time at all isnt it your body is keeping time from womb to tomb it is keeping time from bathroom break to bathroom break it is keeping time from wakeup to sleep it is keeping time yes or no  yes  once its time itll do aaaaa  you dont have to look at the watch once a certain time is up your body will do aaaaa yes or no right now youve seen that old time machines with sand trickling away like that the bladder is keeping time  drop drop drop  as it fills up you know whats the time legs are keeping the time if youd done your practices regularly i mean the tch the program practices not the book practices if youd done the program practices regularly your legs can deceive time you your legs dont know whats the time your legs know  book book practice  so the program practices are of a different nature that cannot be transmitted unless a certain amount of preparation and its a transmission its not a teaching book is a teaching there is a big difference between teaching and transmission do not misunderstand both as one this is a way of creating a smaller step for people because people are not willing to take one big step one small step they read the book and if some small things change they may take the program but there is no substitute for sitting properly with eyes closed and doing what is being done properly and not only that there is no substitute for a transmission if something is not transmitted nothing new till happen improvement of the present will happen nothing new will happen with shambhavi we are not looking at improving you we want something new to sprout in you something that was never there with you till that moment must happen within you thats the intent the book is trying to decorate the existing whatever you are right now to make a little improvement most people are looking for improvements in life they are not looking for transformation transformation means nothing of the old should remain thats transformation but most people cling to the old will you leave 2016 or will you carry it with you hmm can you though it leaves you you will not leave it  2016 will leave you but you will not leave 2016 isnt it  yes  because you are a creature of memories if you are a creature of memories you are a creature of the past hmm that means you are a dinosaur which is extinct  youve become big because of your memories isnt it but youre extinct tch what is the use dinosaur was a big creature but doesnt exist what is the use im asking like this if you live in your memory you are big but what is the use what is needed is to reverberate with what is there now memory is good to handle the world its good only to handle the world its no good to handle this one  isnt it do you understand what im saying memory is good to handle the world around us we need to remember what happened  what happened with this person what happened with that person what happened with that situation and this situation we need to remember it is useful to address the world but with your silly memory you cannot address this one it doesnt mean anything this one you can address only with consciousness there is no other way otherwise you wont have this one you have assembly of things see let me address something very sensitive i want you to listen to this carefully otherwise youll come to wrong conclusions lets say somebody very dear to you dies or they go away for some reason you feel like you lost everything yes or no you feel like you lost everything because you are making up a life of substitution where you are not there you filled it up with other people when they go away there is vacuum but thats not how life is happening because you are there only because you are there you can hold relationships with people isnt it hello  yes  but now in your experience you are not there because you are a creature of memory you can only remember this one and that one and that one you cant remember this one how can you remember this one because this is a current life you cannot remember this one because youre handling everything by memory you will see when one volume of memory which was a certain person or a situation if that goes away it feels like life has come to an end simply because a certain amount of investment youve made in a certain amount of memory you have about a specific person so if you live by memory im saying 2016 will leave you but you will not leave 2016 if you dont leave 2016 how do you go to 2017 you cannot you drag all these years and go into 2017 theres no such thing you will be on a treadmill youll get the exercise but you wont go anywhere treadmill is fine if the weather is bad  but its not a vehicle to go somewhere this much you must understand memory is a treadmill yes memory is a treadmill it is all right to handle situations around us but youre not going to go anywhere with it but human beings have invested so much in their memory theres hardly a handful who will go with me on this one tch im asking how many of you really want to step into 2017 fully leaving 2016 behind  yeah yes  whoa whoa whoa  if you really if really really im saying if you can leave the past as past completely if you can sit here just in the present no past youre enlightened you know thats all it takes its the burden of the past which doesnt let you flower into a full possibility just the burden of the past so this is a good moment this is not something that the planet is doing okay tch yes the solstice has just happened that is there but every day planet is spinning every day it is moving in the trajectory of the planetary movement around the sun you can choose any point to get enlightened you dont have to wait for this point  yes or no but anyway we are at this point where somewhere in your mind youve been told it is significant its only significant because there is a memory of 2016 if there is no memory of 2016 in what way there is a 2017 there is no such thing no no this is sadhguru youre confusing us  sixteen sixteen seventeen  its correct arithmetically correct yes but only because there is memory there is sixteen and there is seventeen isnt it  yes  so if you know how to simply sit here without being burdened by your memory without being a product of memory when i say product of memory  your likes your dislikes whom you love whom you dont love who is your friend who is your enemy all this comes because of your memory isnt it if you can keep all that aside and let the new year blossom you will blossom into a wonderful creature spraying fragrance into the world well there wont be any attendant music nor will there be an applause but if really beautiful things happen who cares whether it is appreciated by somebody  or not  hey where is the attendant music what happened to the musicians  come on nothing so wonderful happened so lets have some music  what  what is this what did you say  isha home school   i have no such mission its for the parents to decide where they want to send their children hmm  so what do you want to do with them eh   oh youre thinking of starting a school here  yes yes so many children  look at that one   she is a missionary im not  anyway just to tell you a few things one thing is on february twentyfourth is a once in a lifetime kind of event for isha that were unveiling this hundredandtwelve feet tall face of adiyogi in coimbatore in the isha yoga center in india its going to be a massive campaign particularly in india but even internationally there will be a certain level of campaign the fundamental idea is to use this iconic face as a galvanizing force  as i said the book is getting ready  to use it as a galvanizing force to move people  its a dangerous thing to say in tennessee  to move people from religion to responsibility why im saying this is  humanity has become like this if small things go wrong in their life they will find one little guy to blame   because of him if big things go wrong in their life theyll find that big guy   because of him what about this guy  some of the studies show that on an average all indian rivers are depleting by eight percent per year that means in about fifteen to twenty years almost all the rivers which have been perennial will become seasonal for variety of reasons so for the last three years ive been working on this and weve come up with a kind of a a policy that the government has to take up weve worked with a couple of state governments which theyre already trying to implement ive managed to convince two chief ministers and make this happen ive recently put this across to the prime minister and hes agreed to this in principle but to raise this awareness across the country because most people are unaware of it completely so and also its been a long time since i drove across the country so were driving from lehladakh which is the ta northernmost tip of india to kanyakumari and back on the east coast and back to delhi totally about 12000 kilometers about sixteen major events will happen on the way so those of you who can drive in india  because it takes a different level of skill if you wish to be a part of that we will do this rally of a certain number of people some can ride on a electric bus rest can drive therell be probably two or four electric busses and maybe twentyfive to fifty cars in each segment lot more will join but this complete trip will be approximately twentyfive cars and two busses probably itll be finalized later but there will be major events in all the cities to raise the awareness about the rivers in india so we want to involve the entire population in the cities therell be rivers you know river related quizzes for the children people will run for the rivers people will cycle for the rivers people will do all kinds of things for rivers on that day when the event comes to that city and above all to make a policy document and when we come back to delhi were having a conference where we present this along with the chief ministers of many states were going to sign a river accord as to what the policy should be about rivers even now different states are fighting with each other for river waters not realizing that in another fifteentwenty years there may be nothing to fight about  yes its a serious situation so this is going to happen if some of you wish to participate in this its going to be an incredible experience of driving across the length and breadth of india which is by any standards the most colorful nation on the planet  chaotic but colorful   it should take about twentyfive days anywhere between twenty to twentyfive days i think  hmm im sorry    about the school  especially in    shes gonna do it anyway so  im not against it but im not for it either  im definitely not against it but i know what it takes to run a good school its not about buildings getting the right people with longterm commitment to wellbeing of children who may not be theirs but when you have children who are not yours you have to do much more than what you would do with yours i need people like that who are willing to do a lot more with somebody elses children than they would do with their own if there are such people a school will come together anyway  if you live by this silly standard of what is yours and what is not yours anyway you will live in a very small space on this planet and in this cosmos if you have no sense of what is yours and what is not yours everything will be open to you thats my blessing to you  let the entire cosmos be yours why are you stingy why are you even stingy in your greediness at least in your greed be boundless hmm im not saying generosity im saying greed at least in your greed let there be no limit that you want everything to be yours  thats greed ultimate thats my blessing  may you become greedy in a limitless way  why are you stingy even on your greed eh
stupid  please
