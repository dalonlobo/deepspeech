you said uri for giving me this optocenticeeto be in conversation with  you shall foundation thank you very much  the when were talking about oflovenlife heart beating is a good thing  a uteiiheesiisagood it to them a life and in love and he about to begin this skunethasion and a hat buriyoenota i attended do in a engineering  i am seen them  are bus and at every where they are your brilliant views on a various issues it could be from the making of a nation to the making of a dog  from the handing of a household and to the running of filament you have brilliantviuseahon every issue that lunanafprqureston yet i know what ye looklabartyou and it you know he has a briliantmindwihenfalanowetewa that say out of the box thinking so  and sort of freshing enlightening i am fascinated and i want to know about your life and i like to know that  i mean well you just born brilliant did i began from that very moment  i was enomend  in come in a box  my mother had a normal to  now it is you know  on the movie than i can head thinking was it likgaesinstorywal of anerablestagegimedyurhome and when i looked at your mother he said  that is going to be on a go rejice you will lighten his own bar as at a a yovyuosaregoinglikethis  now it was it like that or how  how is yard child  i dont think they all came to liz in to my mothers labor paints  with no im reading fascinated  he that we are a  but you know the way you think we we to hear much you have to say be more entychilren wolonoutbut we wont have been been educated in schools and but i find our we have think or of being they condition like almost system in time here is so wetwidedanallbegin i think you are looking for something unnatural that happened there  thinking that could be considered a natural was  it seems i was the ready delaework my mother went to the husband three times and came back and she gave  to hes not coming  no when it atshallye happened it happened at all my brother being a physician that was not qatsibl  had to be the hospital to him i went and tatimsartdinthappen they did have it in possible then she gave up so it happened at home to the only reanablyunnatuilthing everything  a natural word i then  box i i of his ive educated opm but its and the question that you ask king as do people grew up and blotton all of the brother by somebody you  see the gender epesioni  brought up in this place have is  pinductway especially in the west i will see  out of christian  josh very common words i think its absolutely the dipolusandhumiliating that the human being has to be brought up you bring up cat okay you dont bring up at him in being a human being is supposed to blossom by his own niche that is why he is on the top of the pile at least on this planet in their reducionaescale and most human beings dont seem to understand that  are they are not allowed to understand that by a whole lot of people and they need to be brought up bringing up means somebody is mouldinyour molingmens its a pleaded tim in shape  and no flavor the blossoms is the same way as a  the one which blosamdestivy but a more means is always going to be the same  no the idea of making a males that we want to have the same form again and again and again right now genderly that seems to be the work and fortunately after calentdeucationsistem the so all religions that are operating in the world and of course the family they want you to be in a certain more they do on you to bloom like a wild flower  rate of anything fresh happening among them  and something that tdisfamilia they dont want something and familiar to be brown among them so if you have ciccomdtothatsystem then yes you be more into saidnpom if you allow you humanity to blood and see you dont belong to any more  is the beauty of being human that there is now a particular way to be if you were to do it would be one way  he would be on  if youre a sefouwouldbinodoafyou wuduwuldbeanotherwargraspstherestopperrandotheway but to be human means it is not particular way what is human is not define not described it is it is just that for every other creature on this planet nattedrouttulis within that they have to play that again at him in being only the bottom line is drawn  on to lane but socially people are trying to draw to a line for themselves but nature is not on a top line for you elimitliss possibility  this is what is freaking human beings right now because they can decide what they can cope to be their time to be like somebody else on yourortonlineisseid  this is evolution  but i

thing that is happening is not the next it is a serious influence because in the last fifteen years the words had believed to communicate across colchis and borders i saw heavy and so unprecedented nobody has ever been used to this kind of inflencesitifareocan  for this level of hinvlienttanomryoungpeople never before possible  nothedenedition as ever experienced this and of an slope from so many directions no emufrinflencisstoobig so we in terms of changes have happening  it is not a net it is simply somewhere and nobody knows  tis because its too complex and too mixed nobody nosweridisinloringtheyoungpeopleit just and make of things so this is because of a sudden and lot of information and communication we did not fullushojudgewethatit'sgoodawetit is that definitely this level of information when i say information  its like when we were growing up i believe it was to for your denetionanse i never knew what is more on how  that there was no such thing wobujust excited about everything that came our way but youll see to the teluoolk i the bolemart  hi  i see the head as i go because then on the whole costmusteveitsthe in it on the fhornsclenotoannecompudes  on the

worlidslikthatheardalsoitso beginning to happen  by the time the eighteen have seen everything that you need to see it  mind a motion of kin by the time the twenty fire what what next when it no  you will see this is not my wish but this is something that i see the way peoples mind their work  the way they being laden with information i am not a by any stantersoffitimistec person but im us seeing this  if this level of information continues and ittlemunteplyndmaniforl or the coming denevations you should not be sure in the next fifty two hundred years if fifty per cent of the human population choose to come in to his  you should not be sure because that is what will happen to the man somebodys clapping look at this is popular  naehemtisthet  that'sninesayinghed lay sanethingtothe this  a
