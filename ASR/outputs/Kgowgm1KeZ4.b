V good evening everyone
p53
aV good evening everyone
p54
aV nobody is saying anything 
p55
aV  no they are all here but they are very silent
p56
aVthey are all waiting for it all to begin
p57
aVand let me tell you i have to confess
p58
aVas i came on 
p59
aVbefore this i was quite relaxed 
p60
aVbut as ive come on to the stage my heart is beating really fast
p61
aVso  while guruji was praying
p62
aVi was saying to myself i must be relaxed this is the time
p63
aVwhen i am with my guru i must be relaxed that this is it
p64
aVso yes i will calmly begin by thanking you sadhguruji
p65
aVfor giving me this opportunity to be in conversation with you
p66
aVisha foundation thank you very much
p67
aV i i thought when we are talking about of love and life
p68
aVheart beating is a good thing 
p69
aV  okay yes its a good thing
p70
aVit shows im alive and in love and about to begin this conversation
p71
aVand sadhguruji i want to say
p72
aVi have attended your inner engineering program
p73
aVi have seen some dvds
p74
aVi have read your books
p75
aVand everywhere there are your brilliant views on various issues
p76
aVit could be from the making of a nation
p77
aVto the making of a toy car
p78
aVfrom the running of a household to the running of parliament
p79
aVyou have brilliant views on every issue that one can ever question
p80
aVyet i know very little about you
p81
aVand it
p82
aVyou know heres a brilliant mind with an for lack of better words
p83
aVi would say outofthebox thinking 
p84
aVso different
p85
aVso refreshing
p86
aVso enlightening
p87
aVi am fascinated and i want to know about your life
p88
aVand id like to know that
p89
aVi mean
p90
aVwere you just born brilliant
p91
aVdid it begin from that very moment
p92
aV i was a normal birth
p93
aVi didnt come in a box 
p94
aVmy mother had a normal child
p95
aV no you know
p96
aVim from the movies and i cant help thinking 
p97
aVwas it like it is in story books
p98
aVthat a venerable sage came to your home
p99
aVand when he looked at your mother
p100
aVhe said 
p101
aVthere is going to be born a guru rejoice
p102
aVhe will lighten his own path and that of others
p103
aV you also you also going like this 
p104
aV no but was it like that or how was it
p105
aVhow was your childhood
p106
aV i dont think they all came to listen to my mothers labor pains 
p107
aV no im really fascinated
p108
aVintrigued that were all here
p109
aVbut you know the way you think
p110
aVwe wait to hear what you have to say
p111
aVweve all been little children
p112
aVand weve all grown up
p113
aVbut weve grown up and been educated in schools and
p114
aVbut i find our way of thinking
p115
aVour way of being very conditioned
p116
aVlike almost systematized
p117
aVwhereas
p118
aVso where where did it all begin
p119
aV i think youre looking for something unnatural that happened there 
p120
aVone thing that could be considered unnatural was
p121
aVit seems i was a very delayed birth
p122
aVmy mother went to the hospital three times and came back
p123
aVand she gave up that hes not coming 
p124
aVand when it actually happened it happened at home
p125
aVmy father being a physician that was not possible
p126
aVshe she had to be in the hospital
p127
aVthree times she went and three times it didnt happen
p128
aVthey did everything possible and she gave up
p129
aVso it happened at home
p130
aVso thats the only reasonably unnatural thing
p131
aVeverything else was natural  birth
p132
aVi didnt come in a box 
p133
aVand i refused to be educated 
p134
aVso what is
p135
aVi mean the question that youre asking is
p136
aVdo people grow up and blossom
p137
aVor are they brought up by somebody
p138
aVyou will see the general expression is
p139
aVi was brought up in this place
p140
aVi was brought up in that way
p141
aVespecially in the west you will see
p142
aVi was brought up christian
p143
aVi was brought up jewish
p144
aVthese are very common words
p145
aVi think its absolutely ridiculous and humiliating
p146
aVthat a human being has to be brought up
p147
aVyou bring up cattle okay
p148
aVyou dont bring up a human being
p149
aVa human being is supposed to blossom by his own nature
p150
aVthat is why hes on the top of the pile
p151
aVat least on this planet in the evolutionary scale
p152
aVand most human beings dont seem to understand that
p153
aVor they are not allowed to understand that by a whole lot of people
p154
aVand they need to be brought up
p155
aVbringing up means somebody is molding you
p156
aVmolding means its a predetermined shape
p157
aVand no flower that blossoms is the same way as another one
p158
aVwhich blossomed yesterday
p159
aVbut a mold means its always going to be the same
p160
aVif you make a mold
p161
aVthe idea of making a mold is that we want to have the same form
p162
aVagain and again and again
p163
aVright now generally that seems to be the work
p164
aVunfortunately of the current education system
p165
aVthe socalled religions that are operating in the world
p166
aVand of course the family
p167
aVthey want you to be in a certain mold
p168
aVthey dont want you to blossom like a wild flower
p169
aVbecause theyre afraid of anything fresh happening among them
p170
aVthey want something that is familiar
p171
aVthey dont want something unfamiliar to be born among them
p172
aVso if you have succumbed to that system
p173
aVthen yes youve been molded into a certain form
p174
aVif you allow your humanity to blossom
p175
aVthen you will see you dont belong to any mold
p176
aVthis is the beauty of being human that there is no a particular way to be
p177
aVif you were a dog you would be one way
p178
aVif you were cattle you would be one way
p179
aVif you were a sheep you would be another way
p180
aVif youre bird  another way a grasshopper  another way
p181
aVbut to be human means there is no particular way
p182
aVwhat is human is not defined nor described
p183
aVit is it is just that
p184
aVfor every other creature on this planet
p185
aVnature drew two lines
p186
aVwithin that they have to play their game
p187
aVfor a human being only the bottom line is drawn
p188
aVthere is no top line
p189
aVbut socially people are trying to draw a top line for themselves
p190
aVbut nature has not drawn a top line for you
p191
aVits a limitless possibility
p192
aVand this is what is freaking human beings right now
p193
aVbecause they cant decide what they can  need to be
p194
aVtheyre trying to be like somebody else
p195
aVonly bottom line is set top line has been removed
p196
aVthis is evolution
p197
aV but wait we still didnt quite get to
p198
aVso how was it when you were a child
p199
aVwere you were you put into a school to go the systematic way
p200
aVand did you keep up with it
p201
aV do i do i look that edu educated
p202
aVdont insult me like that 
p203
aVactually you know when i go and stand in the line
p204
aVin the immigration lines in particularly in america
p205
aVthey look at me and say can you speak english
p206
aVi say  
p207
aVbecause i have that uneducated look its not easy 
p208
aVdo you know
p209
aVdo you know what it takes to remain uneducated
p210
aVeducation is just twenty years of going somewhere and getting one certificate
p211
aVto remain uneducated its very difficult
p212
aVbecause from the day youre born
p213
aVyour parents every other adult the school the damn thing
p214
aVeverybody is trying to educate you
p215
aV yes
p216
aV about something thats not worked in their life 
p217
aV and then did you also like we all went through these confused teenage years
p218
aVof not really knowing where were going
p219
aVi mean did you clearly know your path
p220
aV not at all
p221
aVi was right from three or four years of age
p222
aVi was always a million questions hanging in in my head
p223
aVi have a question about everything 
p224
aVeverything to everything
p225
aVquestions means very fundamental questions about existence itself
p226
aVmy own existence
p227
aVso when i was three four years of age
p228
aVsuddenly i realized i know nothing
p229
aVknow nothing means 
p230
aVsomebody gives me a glass of water i do not know what is water
p231
aVi know how to use it i know if i drink it
p232
aVit will quench my thirst and so many other ways of using it
p233
aVbut i do not know what is water
p234
aVim saying even today you do not know what is water
p235
aVits the only thing available in all three states on the planet
p236
aVthree two thirds of the planet is water
p237
aVtwo thirds of your body is water
p238
aVif we think life we think water
p239
aVbut do you know what it is
p240
aVwith all the scientific exploration
p241
aVwe do not even know a single atom in its entirety
p242
aVtoday our idea of science is
p243
aVlearning how to use everything
p244
aVyes
p245
aVwe know how to use an atom
p246
aVwe know how to break it
p247
aVwe know how to fuse it
p248
aVbut we really do not know what it is
p249
aVany one thing tiniest thing in the creation
p250
aVwe do not know in its entirety
p251
aVthis is the fact of life
p252
aV well even something simple as what you started with
p253
aVsaying that looking at water
p254
aVi mean straight away i was taught water  h2o
p255
aVand what it can do and it
p256
aVyou can mix it with colors and it becomes that
p257
aVyou can drink it and it quenches your thirst
p258
aVbut i never looked at it and said you know
p259
aVi dont really know what is water
p260
aV because nobody looks at anything
p261
aVsee everybody is looking like this
p262
aVnobody has any attention for a piece of life here
p263
aVtheyre like this 
p264
aVif you pay attention to one life
p265
aVone blade of grass
p266
aVone grasshopper
p267
aVone human being
p268
aVsomething else will happen
p269
aVthats why we said life and love
p270
aVbecause if you pay attention to one human being
p271
aVsome love will happen within you okay
p272
aVif you miss life at least some emotion in that direction must happen to you
p273
aVthat will happen only if you pay attention to one
p274
aVif youre looking at like this 
p275
aVthese days its become a fashion because youre in love on facebook
p276
aVyou love the whole humanity
p277
aVto love one human being
p278
aVif you want to love one human being it costs life
p279
aVto love the whole humanity it doesnt cost anything
p280
aVits even better to love god
p281
aVbecause its always easy to love somebody who is not here now 
p282
aVits so easy
p283
aVbut if you have to love somebody who is sitting next to you right now
p284
aVit costs life
p285
aVyou know how difficult it is to love someone who is next to you right now
p286
aVhow easy it is to love someone who is dead or who is in heaven
p287
aVisnt it so
p288
aVlets face it
p289
aVbecause if you have to love one
p290
aVone thing is you have to pay attention
p291
aVwithout attention it will not happen
p292
aVand above all you have to give up something that is you
p293
aVto accommodate another
p294
aVotherwise it will not happen
p295
aVthe english expression its very good 
p296
aVyou must fall in love
p297
aVyou cannot rise in love
p298
aVyou cannot stand in love
p299
aVyou cannot fly in love
p300
aVyou have to fall
p301
aVsomething of you should fall otherwise it will not work
p302
aVyou will not know it
p303
aVso you want to have a fake sense of life
p304
aVthen you dont pay attention to anything
p305
aVeverything is information
p306
aVnothing is a living experience
p307
aVeverything is from the textbook or from the cinema or from the internet
p308
aVnothing is from lifes experience
p309
aVyoure doing more and more today of that
p310
aV sadhguruji you just mentioned love
p311
aVand today it is about life and love and i would like to know
p312
aVfor us it is maybe love your family members
p313
aVwhoever it could be i i
p314
aVwhy i ask you this is because therere so many versions of this
p315
aVand i really want to get to it
p316
aVsome teachers
p317
aVsome gurus
p318
aVsome guides will say you know
p319
aVyou can love but you must be detached
p320
aV ohoho 
p321
aV you must love but it cannot be conditional
p322
aVit should be unconditional and
p323
aVso theres versions of it
p324
aVi just want to know
p325
aVso have you
p326
aV see the simple the simple way of make you keep coming back to me is
p327
aVto give you something that you cannot do
p328
aVto give you a teaching which you can never do
p329
aVyou must love but you must be detached 
p330
aVnow you have to keep coming back to me for consultation 
p331
aVendlessly
p332
aV  sorry
p333
aV im saying throw yourself into your love affair and die into it
p334
aVsomething will happen
p335
aVsomething worthwhile will happen if youre willing to die into the process
p336
aVnot just anything 
p337
aVwhether its your work or your life or your love or whatever
p338
aVif you do not know how to throw your entire self into it
p339
aVyou will never know the taste of what it is
p340
aVlove but be detached
p341
aVwhat why do you want to love then 
p342
aVonly because you want to include somebody as a part of your life
p343
aVpart of yourself thats why you love
p344
aVno i love but i im detached
p345
aVthis means you have to come back to consultation every day
p346
aVit is like a psychiatrists job
p347
aVeveryday you have to come and sit on the couch
p348
aVyou need treatment and there is a fee 
p349
aV so okay all right
p350
aVso you can love and be attached
p351
aV no no i didnt say that 
p352
aV okay im coming back for consultation please 
p353
aVso what did you say
p354
aV i only said
p355
aVsee what is this need for love in a human being
p356
aVyou must understand
p357
aVa human being constantly
p358
aVconstantly
p359
aVa human being is longing to be something more than what they are right now
p360
aVif this finds a simple basic physical expression
p361
aVwe call this sexuality
p362
aVsexuality means just this
p363
aVphysically youre trying to make something which is not you a part of yourself
p364
aVfor a few moments you may succeed
p365
aVif you try this mentally it gets labeled as greed
p366
aVconquest or maybe simply shopping
p367
aVshopping shopping
p368
aV oh
p369
aV some people go for conquest with swords and guns
p370
aVsome people go with cheque books and cash you know credit cards
p371
aVthe thing is you want to include something which is not a part of you as yourself
p372
aVthat is the whole effort tch
p373
aVwhether you want money or wealth or you want to occupy a nation
p374
aVwhat is it
p375
aVsomething that is not you you want to make it yours
p376
aVyours is an effort to make it a part of yourself
p377
aVif it happens emotionally on the emotional level if you try this
p378
aVwe call this a love affair
p379
aVyoure trying to make somebody who is not a part of you
p380
aVa part of yourself emotionally
p381
aVthis is a love affair
p382
aVif you do it consciously we call this yoga
p383
aVyoga means union
p384
aVso all these efforts are fine
p385
aVeverything has its own beauty but has its own limitations
p386
aVwhen you understand the limitations of all the other methods
p387
aVnothing right or wrong about it
p388
aVit is just that it will work briefly
p389
aVit will not work for always
p390
aVwhen you realize that you consciously try to include
p391
aVwhen you consciously become an inclusive process
p392
aVif you sit here
p393
aVif you experience everything as yourself then we say you are a yogi okay
p394
aVso this is a love affair successful
p395
aV so something you said at the end
p396
aVwhich i would like to ask you again
p397
aVyou said love inclusiveness
p398
aVi cant understand how i can love everybody in this room
p399
aV you cannot
p400
aVthere are some people you cannot love 
p401
aV i can barely see up there and up there
p402
aVso how is tha how do you include everybody in your love
p403
aV see because youre looking at love as something that comes to you
p404
aVor you yield to the process of love
p405
aVonly because you appreciate a particular quality
p406
aVa shape of somebodys nose or the shape of their mind
p407
aVor their thought or their emotion or the way they speak
p408
aVor the way they do things or the way they relate to you
p409
aVsomething okay
p410
aVtherere many many things
p411
aVit is based on something that is acceptable to you
p412
aVif they do something that is not acceptable to you
p413
aVlove crumbles
p414
aV  yes
p415
aV now what im saying is
p416
aVi want you to look at this 
p417
aVwhether love happens to you or hate happens to you
p418
aVanger happens to you misery happens to you joy happens to you
p419
aVit only happens within you isnt it
p420
aV yes
p421
aV it never people say love is in the air
p422
aVno
p423
aVbecause you are feeling very pleasant in your emotions
p424
aVsuddenly air feels vibrant
p425
aVit always been you missed it all your life
p426
aVnow youre beginning to feel it
p427
aV  okay okay
p428
aV all right so whatever human experience 
p429
aVlove or hate whatever whatever 
p430
aVhappens only within you
p431
aVwhat i am saying is at least what happens within you must happen by your choice
p432
aVconsciously you must be able to make it happen
p433
aVif youre able to
p434
aVif your experience or what is happening within you is happening by choice
p435
aVwhat is the problem
p436
aVit only happens within you
p437
aVlove is not a relationship
p438
aVa relationship is a different thing
p439
aVlove is a certain sweetness of your emotion
p440
aVwhether you look at a tree or a dog or a man or a woman or a child or just at the sky
p441
aVwhy cant you look at it lovingly
p442
aVbecause its not about loving the sky
p443
aVits about the sweetness of your emotion
p444
aVif your emotions are sweet
p445
aVwhatever you look at you will look at it in a certain way
p446
aVright now you have nasty emotions whatever you look at
p447
aVyou look at it in a different way
p448
aVso you have always associated love with somebody
p449
aVno no no this is not about somebody
p450
aVlove is not something that you do
p451
aVit is something that you can become
p452
aVif youre willing you can become love
p453
aVyou can make your emotion into a very sweet space
p454
aVif you make your mind
p455
aVif you make your body very pleasant it becomes pleasure
p456
aVif you sit here it can be great pleasure just sitting here and breathing
p457
aVif your mind becomes pleasant we say this is joy
p458
aVif your emotions become pleasant we say this is love
p459
aVif your very life energies become pleasant we say this is blissfulness this is ecstasy
p460
aVif your surroundings become pleasant we call that success
p461
aVnow youre calling your success with somebody as love thats a mistake
p462
aVyou have a success story with somebody  that is
p463
aVyou have created pleasantness in the atmosphere between you and lets say fiveten people around you
p464
aVyoure calling that love
p465
aVno that is actually success because that needs lots of management
p466
aV yes it does
p467
aV yes or no
p468
aV yes it does
p469
aV yes but for you to be loving there is no management
p470
aVif you just make your emotions sweet
p471
aVyour emotions are sweet and its beautiful be be like this
p472
aVits not about anybody
p473
aVif somebody comes we can share it
p474
aVif nobody comes you can sit here with eyes closed and still be loving
p475
aVwhats the problem
p476
aVit is not about somebody its not an action
p477
aVit is not something that you do
p478
aVit is something that you can become 
p479
aV its a its a lovely idyllic
p480
aV it is not idyllic it is it is the way it is
p481
aV it is i mean youd really have to practice this
p482
aV why
p483
aV because im thinking
p484
aV see this is what exactly im saying
p485
aVif it is an action
p486
aVan action comes to perfection with practice only if its an action
p487
aVim saying love is not an act
p488
aVis health an act
p489
aVare you acting healthy right now
p490
aV no
p491
aV i know youre an actor but are you acting healthy
p492
aV  no
p493
aV so health is because
p494
aV yes
p495
aV you have done certain things and health is isnt it
p496
aV oh weve not done certain things
p497
aV oh we have definite
p498
aV weve been given

aV no no no no oh weve been given but if you eat bad
p500
aVif you live bad you wont be healthy
p501
aV hmm
p502
aV weve done certain things to manage our health
p503
aVsimilarly if you do certain things
p504
aVyou can manage the pleasantness of your mind
p505
aVif you do certain other things you can manage the pleasantness of your emotion
p506
aVif you do certain other things you can manage the pleasantness of your very life energies
p507
aVthis is things that you can do
p508
aVnow what you can do internally youre trying to manage externally
p509
aVwhat can be done here within you
p510
aVyou are trying to manage by creating an atmosphere around you
p511
aVwhich is a very difficult thing to do
p512
aVbecause outside will never happen hundred percent the way you want it
p513
aVto some extent we can manage
p514
aVwe cant do all of it by ourselves
p515
aVbecause there are many forces involved
p516
aV sadhguruji you said something about health
p517
aVand you said you do certain things for yourself certain things
p518
aVone  youre given health and then how you maintain it is you eat well
p519
aVyou exercise and you remain healthy
p520
aVnow to be loving when maybe in a household
p521
aVany situation
p522
aVmaybe outside like you said outside forces are not pleasant
p523
aVit doesnt come easily to then just be loving
p524
aVso what is the practice to become that way
p525
aVor to train yourself to be that way
p526
aV i i want to remove this idea from your mind
p527
aVyou believe you need to practice
p528
aVpractice means youre trying to perfet
p529
aVperfect an action isnt it
p530
aV to be loving at all times
p531
aV yes yes thats not an act
p532
aV no not an act but to be so accepting
p533
aV no i dont want to
p534
aVi dont want to go back to the movies okay 
p535
aV no to be so accepting because
p536
aV no its not about accepting
p537
aVright now do you want to keep your mind
p538
aVyour thought process pleasant or nasty
p539
aVtell me what is your choice
p540
aV ideally pleasant
p541
aV just tell me pleasant or nasty
p542
aVyoure thinking about it this is
p543
aV no i am trying to think

aVshould i fox you and say nasty 
p545
aV  say it
p546
aV  okay nasty
p547
aV im going to bless you now 
p548
aV no no no
p549
aVokay i take back my words 
p550
aVokay all right so
p551
aV any human beings choice for themselves is definitely pleasantness isn't it
p552
aV yes
p553
aV body mind emotion everything and surroundings
p554
aVyou want it pleasant
p555
aV yes
p556
aV so why is it not pleasant
p557
aVsurroundings are not pleasant because of many things
p558
aV yes
p559
aV if your thought and emotion are not pleasant
p560
aVits entirely you isnt it
p561
aV yes
p562
aV surroundings  not entirely me its so many forces
p563
aVwe have to manage them
p564
aVwe have to juggle them
p565
aVnot always are we successful with everything around us
p566
aVyou know different people have different levels of competence to manage the outside
p567
aVnot all of us have the same what to say
p568
aVthe skill to manage the outside
p569
aVbut inside your emotion and your thought
p570
aVwhy is it not happening your way
p571
aVthis is something we have to look at
p572
aVthis has to be addressed
p573
aVevery human being has to address this
p574
aVat least your thought and your emotion must happen the way you want it
p575
aVon a certain day a lady went to sleep
p576
aVa lady went to sleep
p577
aVin her sleep  she had a dream
p578
aVi think up there  
p579
aVoh there are two strata of people nobody is asleep right 
p580
aVso that i could pick on you im just looking if i can see
p581
aVshe went to sleep up there 
p582
aVand in her dream she had a dream
p583
aVin her dream she saw a hunk of a man standing in that corner
p584
aVand then he started coming closer and closer and closer
p585
aVhe came so close she could even feel his breath
p586
aVshe trembled not in fear and then she asked
p587
aVwhat will you do to me
p588
aVthe man said well lady its your dream 
p589
aV okay
p590
aV im saying whats happening in your mind is your bloody dream
p591
aVnow the problem with life is 
p592
aVnot that life is not happening the way you want it
p593
aVeven your dream is not happening the way you want it
p594
aVthats the problem 
p595
aVim saying at least fix this
p596
aVat least let the dream happen the way you want it
p597
aVif you were dreaming the way you want right now
p598
aVyour thought and your emotion would be pleasant isnt it
p599
aV yes but it well
p600
aV fixing the world is another thing thats a different game
p601
aVthat needs lot of skill
p602
aVthis needs just willingness
p603
aVwhy were continuously talking about joy blissfulness love
p604
aVis not because its a goal by itself
p605
aVthese are not goals by itself
p606
aVonly by when you are pleasant by your own nature
p607
aVyou stop being in pursuit of happiness
p608
aVyou are fine by yourself
p609
aVyou dont have to go anywhere to feel pleasant
p610
aVyou dont have to do anything to feel pleasant
p611
aVsitting here youre feeling very pleasant
p612
aVnow you will look at life the way it is
p613
aVotherwise youre an endless race
p614
aVpursuit of your happiness is a lifelong thing
p615
aVtill your deathbed youre pursuing
p616
aVwhat does it mean
p617
aVif youre pursuing happiness when you are five i can understand
p618
aVbut that was not the fact
p619
aVwhen youre five you were simply happy by your own nature
p620
aVwhen youre fifty youre pursuing your happiness
p621
aVthis is a failed story isnt it
p622
aV but sadhguruji suppose we say this to the common man
p623
aVwho has a little house
p624
aV where did you meet a common man
p625
aV im imagining it
p626
aV every man or woman think theyre special believe me
p627
aV oh yes
p628
aV yes so where did you meet a common man im asking 
p629
aV okay sadhguruji when you said about the common person and the special person
p630
aVi know some teachers have always told us
p631
aVand why your own parents always tell you that you know 
p632
aVyou are special
p633
aVeach one of us is unique
p634
aVand i remember this part
p635
aVi am not sure whether i heard it at your discourse or on a dvd of yours
p636
aVwhere you said it was about you know people being special
p637
aVand us always thinking that god knows of us
p638
aVand you said something like
p639
aVdo you know all the grasshoppers in your garden
p640
aVso of course all of us have said no
p641
aVso you said something like
p642
aVso how does god know each one of you then
p643
aVand i was devastated because i always thought
p644
aVsomebody up there knows me cares about me and im special
p645
aV you thought you thought youre number
p646
aVyou thought you were number one on his books is it
p647
aV well ive been told since i was kid
p648
aVyoure special youre unique and god cares about you
p649
aV let me tell tch tch tch see if when somebody says youre unique
p650
aVits an insult  you know
p651
aV no you said  no top line so youre
p652
aV okay
p653
aV peaking in different ways
p654
aV in this vast cosmos this solar system is just a speck
p655
aVtomorrow morning if the whole solar system disappears vanishes evaporates
p656
aVnobody will even notice it
p657
aVmaybe its not even in the accounts books of creation
p658
aVits so small
p659
aVin this speck of a solar system
p660
aVplanet earth is a super speck
p661
aVin that mumbai is a micro super speck
p662
aVin that you are a big man or a woman 
p663
aVthis is a huge problem
p664
aVthis is a very immense existential problem you know 
p665
aVthis is because we have lost perspective as to who we are what we are
p666
aVour psychological realities have become bigger than the cosmo than the cosmic reality
p667
aVthat is the big problem
p668
aVits time you step out of your cinema
p669
aVim im not talking about the hindi cinema
p670
aVim talking about the cinema that everybody is playing in their own minds
p671
aVsee see right now they darkened this whole hall
p672
aVbecause it works best that way
p673
aVthis is the basic technology of a cinema
p674
aVif you do not darken the cinema hall
p675
aVif you light it up and play a nice cinema its not going to work
p676
aVyou have to darken it
p677
aVso im saying a cinema of your mind because its a dark space
p678
aVevery thought is enlarged
p679
aVplaying out bigger than the cosmic space
p680
aVtoday everything in the cosmos is happening perfectly well
p681
aVbut you have one nasty thought crawling in your head
p682
aVand it feels like a bad day isnt it
p683
aV yes yes
p684
aV so thats because your psychological realities
p685
aVyour petty creation has become larger than the creators creation
p686
aVyou lost perspective of life
p687
aVthat is the fundamental basis of all this confusion and suffering
p688
aVif you see who you are
p689
aVthe micro speck that you are
p690
aVyou wouldnt imagine that god is made in your own image
p691
aVand he looks like you and whatever
p692
aVokay if if we were all buffalos
p693
aVwe would definitely think god is a big buffalo 
p694
aV okay okay so what is it really
p695
aVplease tell us the please define it for us
p696
aVwhat is it
p697
aVwhat is going on  this life this love
p698
aVall these emotions that we go through in our lives
p699
aVall these thoughts that we create for ourselves
p700
aVwhat is going on
p701
aV see these are all human possibilities and capabilities
p702
aVevery possibility becomes a problem
p703
aVfor those who do not explore the possibility in its right perspective
p704
aVthought is a tremendous possibility
p705
aVan ant cannot think like you
p706
aVhe can work better than you
p707
aVhes more disciplined
p708
aVhe betters main better traffic rules than you
p709
aVtheres no traffic jam out there 
p710
aVokay but he cannot think like you
p711
aV yes
p712
aV that sets up apart
p713
aVthis is a possibility
p714
aVbut now this possibility has become a problem for ninety percent of the humanity
p715
aVnow theyre freaking because they can think
p716
aVand theyre thinking all the wrong things
p717
aVtheir thoughts have become nasty
p718
aVif they were pleasant they would have enjoyed their thought process
p719
aVbecause its become nasty its becoming a ailment isnt it
p720
aVpeople are suffering their thoughts immensely
p721
aVbecause they do not know how to keep it pleasant
p722
aVnothing has been done towards it
p723
aVso what is a possibility always becomes a problem
p724
aVif you do not explore it in the right perspective
p725
aVso your thought and emotion has become a problem
p726
aVnow love affair is a problem
p727
aVyoure making all kinds of things out of it
p728
aVwhich are all coming from this misunderstanding
p729
aVnot understanding this thought and emotion is generated by me
p730
aVi can generate it whichever way i want
p731
aVif nastiness is what you like you do it
p732
aVi dont care if thats what you like
p733
aVbut youre suffering it
p734
aVif youre suffering it you shouldnt be doing it
p735
aVi am not telling you be loving
p736
aVwhat is your choice 
p737
aVpleasantness or unpleasantness
p738
aVif unpleasantness is your choice you enjoy it and do it
p739
aVwhats my problem
p740
aVyou want to drink poison what is my problem
p741
aVi am just telling you this is poison this is this 
p742
aVdrink whatever you want but by choice
p743
aVdont drink unconsciously thats stupid
p744
aVthats not befitting of a human being
p745
aVa human being means we are far more conscious than every other creature on this planet 
p746
aVthats what sets us apart
p747
aVevery creature eats but we can eat consciously
p748
aVso our eating becomes so many things
p749
aVevery creature has sexual drives
p750
aVthey go and fulfill it whichever way
p751
aVwe can do it consciously
p752
aVso we become something something
p753
aVwere doing the same things but were doing it consciously
p754
aVsuddenly there is a magic about it
p755
aVnot because sex is magic food is magic no
p756
aVbecause we can do it consciously
p757
aVevery basic act like eating and copulating becomes magical
p758
aVbecause we can do it consciously
p759
aVif you leave that one thing
p760
aVif you exclude that one thing from your life
p761
aVthat you are not conscious about the way you think
p762
aVthe way you feel
p763
aVthe way you act
p764
aVthe way you move your body 
p765
aVif youre not conscious about it
p766
aVeverything can turn ugly
p767
aVeverything can become nasty
p768
aVso it is this which sets you apart from every other creature
p769
aVso a dog is walking on the street
p770
aVif you show it a biscuit it will wag its tail
p771
aVif you do this  grrr it will do
p772
aVif this is what you are that
p773
aVif somebody is nice to you
p774
aVyou will wag your whatever
p775
aVif somebody is not nice to you you will bite them im saying what
p776
aVwhere is evolution in you
p777
aVforget about civilization im talking about evolution
p778
aVwheres the evolution
p779
aVwheres the sign of evolution im asking 
p780
aV okay sadhguruji lets go to hmm
p781
aV ive seen people copying answers in examination but never questions
p782
aV yeah questions 
p783
aVwell
p784
aVtoday many women in our modern society are stepping out and having a career
p785
aVand i just like to know what do you think of this
p786
aVof women stepping out being career people managing home as well
p787
aVbeing financially independent
p788
aVis this good
p789
aV see every woman should do what she wants to do as an individual person
p790
aVit should not be made into a trend in a society or the only right thing to do in the world
p791
aVbecause i think if if a woman is
p792
aVintends to have two children and raise them
p793
aVi think its a full time job
p794
aVim not saying she should not go out and work
p795
aVif she wishes to as an individual person shes free to do what she wants to do
p796
aVbut having two children is not about reproduction
p797
aVyoure manufacturing the next generation of people
p798
aVhow the world will be tomorrow
p799
aVwill be determined by what kind of mothers you have today
p800
aVbelieve me
p801
aVyou know ive seen many ladies coming to me and say
p802
aVwhen i ask whatre you doing
p803
aVoh im just a housewife
p804
aVi said why do you say youre just a housewife
p805
aVyou you dont seem to understand the significance of
p806
aVyou know being able to nurture two or three new lives
p807
aVits not its not a not important job its a very important job
p808
aVcareer  i want you to understand
p809
aVright now because we have made the whole world into economics
p810
aVunfortunately women also getting as stupid as men
p811
aVas if how much money you earn is going to determine the value of your life
p812
aVno
p813
aVit is just procurement of things that you need
p814
aVmoney is just about that
p815
aVman was procuring
p816
aVwoman was taking about the more beautiful aspects of life
p817
aVnow woman also wants to procure
p818
aVif there is such an economic need in the family fine she must do it
p819
aVbut it is not a compulsive need
p820
aVit must not be set up as something better to do than doing something
p821
aVif she sings so if she if she plays music or if she just loves her children
p822
aVor if she cooks beautifully
p823
aVor she just lives beautifully like a flower
p824
aVits good enough im saying
p825
aVit is not necessary that only if she earns this much money shes her shes doing something valuable
p826
aVotherwise shes not
p827
aVif theres an economic need she can do it
p828
aVor if she has a passion for doing it she can do it
p829
aVbut let not such values be set up in the world because youre not evolving
p830
aVyoure regressing
p831
aVyoure making survival more important than aesthetics of life 
p832
aV okay sadhguruji let me take you away from this
p833
aVand let me take you to a world of say films where i come from
p834
aV world of films okay lets go lets go movies 
p835
aV years ago when films started
p836
aVand you know through the sixties seventies there were lovely stories
p837
aVnice values beautiful music lyrics
p838
aVby the time i was the star in movies some of our jhatka matkas might have shocked the previous generations
p839
aVand they must have said what is all this
p840
aVbut it was still within limits
p841
aV whose limits 
p842
aVi mean whats acceptable to society whatever have been
p843
aVill say and then now today the complexion of films
p844
aVthe kind of films we see
p845
aVyou know its little clothed
p846
aVits livein relationships
p847
aVor you know up there on screen for everybody to see and night club culture
p848
aVi mean it sometimes worries me
p849
aVthat my children are growing up now
p850
aVthis is what theyre seeing this is
p851
aVthese are the kind of songs that theyre listening to
p852
aVthe lyrics are about you know
p853
aV from janam janam to expiry date is the song 
p854
aV yes so this is the
p855
aVthis is what theyre watching this is what they think is cool
p856
aVthis is this is the hip and happening stuff im little
p857
aV i think by the time you came the janam janam was over isnt it 
p858
aV no it was still there it was in the middle somewhere
p859
aVthe music was wonderful the lyrics was still lovely
p860
aVbut today it is munni badhnaam ho gayi and it things
p861
aVthings have really moved to chewing gums
p862
aVand im forgetting at this moment what the lyrics are but then its its
p863
aVits shallow right now
p864
aVindia has the youngest population in the world right now
p865
aVso with such a young nation growing up on this this is the feed
p866
aVim just a little concerned as to what they will turn out to be
p867
aV im sure your parents were concerned too
p868
aV they  okay so can i
p869
aV im sure my parents were very concerned when i was growing up
p870
aVso every parent has this concern every generation has this concern
p871
aVthat the next generation is going wrong always
p872
aVi understand what youre saying
p873
aVthis sudden change if every generation likes to go
p874
aVone step beyond where the previous generation has stepped in on eve
p875
aValmost everything just for the sake of doing something different or its natural theyve grown up in one atmosphere
p876
aVthey take it to another level
p877
aV they move to the next level
p878
aV yes next is not always next  thats what youre saying
p879
aVnext is not always next right
p880
aV yes its not higher
p881
aV okay
p882
aV its somewhere else its just its
p883
aV its just next
p884
aVso this concern is always there but
p885
aVright now the change that is happening is not the next
p886
aVit is a serious influence because
p887
aVin the last fifteen years the worlds ability to communicate across cultures and borders
p888
aVis so heavy and so unprecedented
p889
aVnobody has ever been used to these kind of influences before
p890
aVokay never before this level of influence on our young people
p891
aVnever before possible
p892
aVno other generation has ever experienced this kind of onslaught from so many directions
p893
aVand the volume of influence is too big
p894
aVso in terms of changes are happening not
p895
aVit is not next
p896
aVit is simply somewhere and nobody knows where it is
p897
aVbecause its too complex and too mixed
p898
aVnobody knows where it is including the young people
p899
aVits just a mix of things
p900
aVso this is because of a sudden onslaught of information and communication
p901
aVits not for us to judge whether its good or bad
p902
aVit is just that definitely this level of information 
p903
aVwhen i say information
p904
aVits like when we were growing up
p905
aVi believe it was true for your generation also
p906
aVwe we never knew what is boredom okay
p907
aVthis was there was no such thing
p908
aVwe were just excited about everything that came our way
p909
aVbut you see today twelveyearold kids
p910
aVif you tell them what  ahhm
p911
aV yes 
p912
aV you see theyre just bored because
p913
aVthey know the whole cosmos there its
p914
aVthey have seen it on their phone screen not even on a computer screen
p915
aVon the phone screen theyve seen the entire cosmos
p916
aVthey know everything
p917
aVthings that you do not know they know
p918
aVyou ask them they know it
p919
aV yes
p920
aV by information
p921
aVby the time theyre eighteen they have had five love affairs and gone 
p922
aVin the western world its like that here also its beginning to happen okay
p923
aVso by the time theyre eighteen theyve seen everything that you need to see
p924
aVwith body mind emotion okay
p925
aVby the time theyre twentyfive what
p926
aVwhat next
p927
aV what next yes
p928
aV no you will see this is not my wish
p929
aVbut this is something that i see the way peoples minds are working
p930
aVthe way theyre being led in with information 
p931
aVim not a by any standards a pessimistic person
p932
aVbut im just seeing this
p933
aVif this level of information continues and it will multiply many fold
p934
aVfor the coming generations
p935
aVyou should not be surprised
p936
aVin the next fifty to hundred years
p937
aVif fifty percent of the human population choose to commit suicide
p938
aVyou should not be surprised
p939
aVbecause that is what will happen to the mind 
p940
aVsomebody is clapping look at this its popular 
p941
aV no you have just touched a chord and thats
p942
aV no im saying
p943
aVwe think we realize something
p944
aV today today
p945
aVthis day more people commit suicide in this world
p946
aVthan all the wars and murders and accidents manage to kill
p947
aVso more people are on selfhelp already than
p948
aVmurderers war mongers bad drivers everything put together
p949
aVmore people are on selfhelp
p950
aVand if this level of information onslaught continues on human mind 
p951
aVi know the nature of mind absolutely because i know my mind
p952
aVi know how it works what it can handle what it cannot do
p953
aVi know it clearly what human mind is
p954
aVthats the reason why i dont have to read peoples books
p955
aVor listen to their entire thing
p956
aVif they say one sentence i know what their mind is
p957
aVbecause i know the structure of human mind entirely
p958
aVotherwise i wouldnt be who i am
p959
aVso im saying this
p960
aVif this level of information onslaught continues at the same phase or at higher phase
p961
aVwhich is possible in the next few years
p962
aVthis will definitely lead to wanting to terminate yourself
p963
aVbecause there would be nothing to live for
p964
aVthere is no joy and excitement about anything
p965
aVyou please watch your children
p966
aVby the time theyre twelve fifteen theyre just bored
p967
aVyou look back at your own life those of you who are over fifty years of age
p968
aVjust look back at in or on your own life
p969
aVwhen you were twelve fifteen
p970
aVwas there any room for you to get bored about anything
p971
aVsimply you are excited about every little thing isnt it
p972
aV yeah
p973
aV today you will see its almost a common feature
p974
aVtwelve fifteen year old kids are just bored only thing is 
p975
aV yes they are all on ipads and iphones yes they are on gadgets
p976
aV because were talking about love and life 
p977
aVall this will not mean nothing because you had one love affair when you were eighteen years of age
p978
aVyou thought this is your life and youre going to willing to die for it
p979
aVwhether you died for it or not but at least at that time you thought youll die for it okay
p980
aVtoday by the on facebook they had twentytwo love affairs going simultaneously 
p981
aVit just means nothing
p982
aVi im not saying they should have it or not have it
p983
aVall im saying is this will lead to a certain overload on the mind
p984
aVand suddenly a human being will think why am i here
p985
aVyou know that big shakespearian question
p986
aVto be or not to be
p987
aV yes
p988
aV this is not the most intelligent question 
p989
aVunfortunately people think so
p990
aVthis is only because you have not been touched by life
p991
aVyou are not a piece of life
p992
aVyoure just a psychological case
p993
aVyou are full of thoughts and emotions
p994
aVyou have not touched life at all
p995
aVyou think your thoughts and la emotions are life
p996
aVno
p997
aVyour thoughts and emotions are the drama that you are creating in your mind
p998
aVit is your cinema
p999
aVyou must be able to end it somewhere
p1000
aVif you do not know how to put the end then its going on endless cinema youre going crazy
p1001
aVlife is happening here
p1002
aVyou know your work is not life
p1003
aVyour family is not life your career is not life
p1004
aVyour cinema is not life your thought is not life
p1005
aVyour emotion is not life
p1006
aVlife is happening here
p1007
aVeverything else is accessories to life
p1008
aVnow the frills of life have become larger than life itself
p1009
aVlife is entirely missed
p1010
aVif you touch life within you then its an explosion of energy
p1011
aVwhen such a thing never happens to you
p1012
aVbecause you have information about the whole cosmos on your phone screen
p1013
aVyoull never be touched by life because too much information too much thought
p1014
aVeven emotion is drying up too much thought
p1015
aVthis has happened
p1016
aVif you look at european philosophy in the last hundred hundred and fifty years
p1017
aVyou will see if you read dostoyevsky you will want to commit suicide
p1018
aVbrilliant intellectually brilliant
p1019
aVbut you will wonder why are you alive
p1020
aVbecause intellect is like that if you wake up in the morning
p1021
aVdevoid of any touching any lifes experience within you
p1022
aVdont think about your childs face
p1023
aVdo not think about the flowers in the garden
p1024
aVbirds in the sky
p1025
aVnothing beautiful that ever touched you
p1026
aVjust think logically you have to get out of bed thats not a small feat
p1027
aVyou have to brush your teeth breakfast go to work eat work eat sleep
p1028
aVagain tomorrow morning same thing
p1029
aVnext fifty years you have to do the same process every day
p1030
aVif you look at it one hundred percent logically and intellectually
p1031
aVyou will have no reason to live today morning
p1032
aVtomorrow morning
p1033
aVits only if youre touched by something suddenly its worth living
p1034
aVif youre not touched by anything then its not worth living
p1035
aVwhat is what is so worth living about a human being 
p1036
aVwaking up in the morning
p1037
aVtotking tro tr you know troding  through life
p1038
aVtrudging through life everyday eating sleeping same rubbish
p1039
aVwhat is the point
p1040
aVthere is no point unless youre touched by something
p1041
aVsome magic of life if it doesnt touch you either in the form of love
p1042
aVor in the form of a flower or in the form of something within you
p1043
aVif something doesnt sparkle within you definitely there is a question
p1044
aVwhether i should live or not isnt it
p1045
aVand we are taking humanity in that direction with this overload of information
p1046
aVinformation is not knowing
p1047
aVinformation is just garbage collection
p1048
aVyou just gather things which dont mean anything to you
p1049
aVyou look smart in a tea party but youre not smart with life
p1050
aVokay
p1051
aVif youre smart with life you must be blissful isnt it 
p1052
aVif youre really smart with life you must be joyful and blissful isnt it so
p1053
aVyoure only smart in a tea party
p1054
aVbecause you know when somebody is talking something
p1055
aVyou know the galaxy z22
p1056
aVwhat happens there
p1057
aVeverybody  wow 
p1058
aVthey can also open the internet and the same thing

aVyou see you think this guy visited the galaxy 
p1060
aV so sadhguruji then what is it

aVgive us in clear simple simple sentences 
p1063
aVdo this and you will be at least on the way to be blissful or happy or aware or
p1064
aVliving in a nice conscious way 
p1065
aV see if you if you just observe
p1066
aVif everybody makes a little effort
p1067
aVeverybody take a little time for this piece of life okay
p1068
aVnot for your family
p1069
aVnot for your career
p1070
aVnot for something else something else

aVbecause this is the most important piece of life in your life isnt it
p1073
aVyes or no
p1074
aV yes
p1075
aV even if youre in love with somebody 
p1076
aVstill this is the most important piece of life isnt it
p1077
aVso pay some attention to this
p1078
aVhow does it happen why have you taken it for granted
p1079
aVbelieve me youre not going to be here for anever
p1080
aVill bless you with a long life but youre going to fall dead one day 
p1081
aVyes or no
p1082
aV yes
p1083
aV so do not take this for granted
p1084
aVif you wake up in the morning

aVtomorrow if you wake up in the morning 
p1086
aVno this is not my wish but i want you to know
p1087
aVof all that people who go to bed tonight
p1088
aVover a million people will not wake up tomorrow morning
p1089
aVand tomorrow if you and me wake up tomorrow morning
p1090
aVis it not a fantastic thing
p1091
aVa million people did not wake up
p1092
aVyou woke up
p1093
aVis it not a great thing
p1094
aV yes
p1095
aV just look at the ceiling and smile
p1096
aVyou are still awake 
p1097
aVyoure still there
p1098
aVa million people did not get up in the morning
p1099
aVand you woke up
p1100
aVand for many many millions of people
p1101
aVsomebody who is dear to them did not wake up
p1102
aVso just check those five six people around you
p1103
aVthey all woke up  wow its a fantastic day 
p1104
aVyou woke up and everybody who matters to you around you woke up
p1105
aVis it not fantastic day
p1106
aV yes
p1107
aV you dont think so
p1108
aV yes 
p1109
aV yes yes
p1110
aV you dont seem to think so
p1111
aVbecause the problem is just this you are living with an idea that you are immortal
p1112
aVwhen i say youre immortal
p1113
aVyoure not actually thinking youre immortal
p1114
aVbut youre not conscious of your mortality
p1115
aVif youre not conscious of your mortality
p1116
aVsomewhere you think youre immortal isnt it
p1117
aVhow many moments in a day are you conscious that youre mortal
p1118
aVif you were conscious would you have time to crib
p1119
aVwould you have time to fight with somebody
p1120
aVwould you have time to do some rubbish with your life
p1121
aVif you knew
p1122
aVif youre conscious that you are mortal you would do nothing
p1123
aVother than what is absolutely needed for you and everybody around you
p1124
aVthis one thing if you do
p1125
aVif you just remind yourself you
p1126
aVdont think this is a negative thing
p1127
aVdeath is not a negative thing its the only thing which has added value to your life
p1128
aVif youre here forever you would be unbearable 
p1129
aV yeah  yes yes
p1130
aV isnt it
p1131
aVarent we glad everybody dies one day 
p1132
aVif you just become conscious of this one thing
p1133
aVthat always youre conscious that im mortal
p1134
aVyou dont have to think i will die today
p1135
aVwe dont intend we want to live as far as possible
p1136
aVjust you know one day i will die
p1137
aVif youre just conscious of this one thing
p1138
aVyou will naturally become spiritual
p1139
aVyou will not become spiritual by thinking about god
p1140
aVyou will become unrealistic hallucinatory you will start talking to somebody
p1141
aVyou will start doing all kinds of things
p1142
aValready people you know they have ear phones on and theyre talking
p1143
aVyou dont know whether theyve lost it or they 
p1144
aVten years ago if somebody was walking on the street talking you would know that hes lost
p1145
aVbut today you dont know 
p1146
aVwhether they got their head phones on
p1147
aVor they just lost it and theyre talking we cannot make out
p1148
aVbut if you are conscious that youre mortal every moment of your life
p1149
aVspiritual process has begun for you
p1150
aVso the one one of the main reasons
p1151
aVone of the fundamental reasons why that all these things have to be taught to you that she is repeatedly asking this question
p1152
aVwere you born special did you have normal birth or not is simply because
p1153
aVmost people have forgotten they are mortal
p1154
aVthey think theyre immortal they may not actually think theyre immortal
p1155
aVbut theyre not conscious they are mortal
p1156
aVwith every step with every breath if they were conscious of this
p1157
aVyou know how consciously they would live
p1158
aVthey would become fantastic it is your mortality which makes you want to know what is the nature of your existence
p1159
aVyou really want to know where you came from where you will go only when it sinks into you
p1160
aVall this drama pup  one day it will end
p1161
aVbut right now you think only others appear in obituary columns
p1162
aVyou are only going to read it 
p1163
aV that was that was simply beautiful
p1164
aV thats all thats needed
p1165
aVif you want to know the value of life
p1166
aVjust know that its a brief happening
p1167
aVthe time that you spend here as life its a very relative experience
p1168
aVif youre truly joyful and ecstatic its horribly brief believe me
p1169
aVi feel like i was born day before yesterday
p1170
aVsee already how i have become   okay
p1171
aV  yes yes
p1172
aV but on a particular day if youre depressed or miserable
p1173
aVone day seems like an endless thing
p1174
aVso only miserable people have a looooooooong life 
p1175
aVif youre a joyful ecstatic person life is always brief
p1176
aVif you live to be hundred its still very brief
p1177
aVfor what possibilities a human being carries for the immensity of what a human being is 
p1178
aVits too brief a life
p1179
aVif youre given hundred years two hundred years its still still too brief
p1180
aVbecause before you know whats happening before you exp exp explore a few dimensions of life itll be over
p1181
aVitll be over over okay
p1182
aVonly miserable people have a very long life
p1183
aVthey feel its very long 
p1184
aV sadhguruji here we have a few questions
p1185
aVthe first stion is from prabhas sundaras sundar sen 
p1186
aVwhere and how do we draw the line between loving unconditionally
p1187
aVand becoming a doormat 
p1188
aV see we need to understand this 
p1189
aVwhats being right now passed around as love is generally a mutual benefit scheme
p1190
aVyou give me this ill give you that
p1191
aVif you dont give me that i dont give you this
p1192
aVthis is not said but its done 
p1193
aV okay 
p1194
aV its done isnt it
p1195
aVits not said
p1196
aVso human beings have physical psychological emotional economic social
p1197
aVand various other kinds of needs
p1198
aVto fulfill these things
p1199
aVwhen you say i love you
p1200
aVinstead of making these things ugly needs that we have to
p1201
aVugly transactions that we have to do  you give me this you give me that
p1202
aVto bring some aesthetic and beauty to this transaction
p1203
aVwe quote it with a certain amount of sweetness of emotion
p1204
aVwhich we call as love affair
p1205
aVwhere the transactions happen more smoothly
p1206
aVbecause once we are human somehow doing basic transactions in a basic way makes us feel ugly
p1207
aVif you take food with both your hands and eat it its ugly isnt it
p1208
aVwe want to eat in a certain way
p1209
aVsimilarly to fulfill our physical needs
p1210
aVemotional needs economic needs we have arrangements
p1211
aVwhere we can conduct this in a more aesthetic manner
p1212
aVim not saying its right or wrong this is the fact of life
p1213
aVso this level of love
p1214
aVi call this
p1215
aVthis is enough for to fulfill the domestic needs of ones
p1216
aVyou know for two people to live together
p1217
aVto fulfill their needs
p1218
aVto produce children
p1219
aVto raise them domestic level of love affair people can have
p1220
aVbut if people want to have a love affair which will bring them to an ultimate union
p1221
aVthen not many people are competent to do that
p1222
aVnot people not many people are ready to have that kind of a love affair
p1223
aVwhere itll make two lives into one
p1224
aVtwo becomes actually one in experience
p1225
aVthat will need something more
p1226
aVmost people are competent of using love to fulfill the domestic needs
p1227
aVbut to go beyond that they are not ready
p1228
aVwhen i say theyre not ready either
p1229
aVim not talking about this person or that person
p1230
aVso when one is ready and another is not ready or
p1231
aVone is making an effort and another doesnt have the effort
p1232
aVthen it feels like somebody is becoming a doormat
p1233
aVthat is what it is that it feels like theyre being exploited
p1234
aVbut above all one who is longing to become use love as a way of ultimate union
p1235
aVshould not be bothered about being doormat this and that
p1236
aVin india we have a culture
p1237
aVwhere by choice people name themselves as slaves
p1238
aVyou know ramdas krishnadas this das that das
p1239
aVwhat is this
p1240
aVtheyre openly saying im a slave
p1241
aVim a doormat
p1242
aVi want to be a doormat
p1243
aVthey are not saying im afraid ill be used as a doormat
p1244
aVtheyre saying i want to be doormat
p1245
aVso this is a kind of love that theyre wanting to use to
p1246
aVuse for ultimate union
p1247
aVthis is not for domestic purposes
p1248
aVso if youre looking for ultimate union then love is a different affair
p1249
aVif youre looking for conducting of domestic affairs
p1250
aVthen you must manage dignity
p1251
aVwho gets what
p1252
aVif anybody is using more than what they should then
p1253
aVif you dont give me that i dont give you this okay
p1254
aVotherwise if youre looking for ultimate union
p1255
aVyou should not think of all these things thats a different affair
p1256
aVthats not for normal social thing
p1257
aVif you fall in love itself you become vulnerable to somebody
p1258
aV yes
p1259
aV without becoming vulnerable there is no love affair
p1260
aVyou have to fall
p1261
aVwhen you fall somebody may raise you
p1262
aVor somebody may walk over you 
p1263
aV yes
p1264
aV but the thing is the
p1265
aVthe experience of your life is beautiful
p1266
aVbecause you fell not because they raised you
p1267
aVnot because they walked over you
p1268
aVbecause you could actually have the sense of abandon in you to fall
p1269
aVthat was the beauty of your love affair
p1270
aVnot what they gave you what they did to you this  no
p1271
aVthe beauty was you sat alone and you think you really loved this person
p1272
aVso much youre willing to die
p1273
aVthat was the most beautiful moment 
p1274
aVnot the moment they gave you a big gift
p1275
aVnot the moment they gave you a diamond ring
p1276
aVnot the moment they said this and that about you  no
p1277
aVyou just sat here and youre willing to die that was the moment
p1278
aVnot just a doormat
p1279
aVyoure willing to be the dust on their feet okay
p1280
aVim not saying you should be like that 
p1281
aVim saying where love transformed itself into a devotion
p1282
aVif you fall in love itself you become very vulnerable
p1283
aVbut there are still some shreds of sanity in love affairs that you can recover
p1284
aVbut if you become a devotee there is no sanity left and you cannot recover
p1285
aVso before you tread such a land
p1286
aVyou must see whether youre for it or not
p1287
aVwhat are your goals first of all
p1288
aVif your goal is to make a life a cautioned
p1289
aVa very measured love affair is good
p1290
aVbut youre your your thing is you want to dissolve into the process of life
p1291
aVyou dont want to have a good life
p1292
aVyoure not planning to have a good life
p1293
aVyou just want to become explosion of life
p1294
aVyou dont care what you get and what you dont get
p1295
aVthen you become a devotee
p1296
aVa devotion means its your intention to dissolve into your object of devotion
p1297
aVso a devotee is not expecting whether ill become a doormat or a crown on somebodys head
p1298
aVwhatever i become as long as i can touch your feet or head or whatever
p1299
aVits fine with me
p1300
aV yeah
p1301
aV so thats a different state of existence
p1302
aVi dont think
p1303
aVsomebody who is looking for domestic level of love affair should even ask that question 
p1304
aV mmm we have one question from the social media the facebook 
p1305
aVamitmadan wants to know
p1306
aVin this materialistic age the real feeling of love is disappearing from our life
p1307
aVmost of the love we receive from others and express to others is superficial
p1308
aVhow can we reinforce the real feeling of love in our own life and in others
p1309
aV forget about others
p1310
aVif you
p1311
aVif you learn to be loving by your own nature
p1312
aVnot because of somebody else or something else
p1313
aVi know the question is coming from facebook
p1314
aVtheres an enormous possibility 
p1315
aVyou can even love those people who dont even exist 
p1316
aVso im saying its a tremendous possibility
p1317
aVso 
p1318
aVif you just become love
p1319
aVnot love somebody then you will know the nature of love
p1320
aVif you love somebody its a fickle happening
p1321
aVbecause no human being will happen hundred percent the way you want them
p1322
aVevery human being on this planet is going to disappoint you believe me
p1323
aVnot because theyll do something wrong because nobody can fulfill the
p1324
aVunrealistic expectation you have of them
p1325
aVits simply not possible
p1326
aVhave you been able to fulfill anybodys expectation im asking you entirely
p1327
aVpartially but never entirely isnt it
p1328
aVso nobody else will be able to do it
p1329
aVunless youre a still such a hopeless romantic
p1330
aVyoure still waiting that ideal person is going to come from somewhere 
p1331
aVno
p1332
aVbelieve me whoever comes
p1333
aVi want you to know the ideal people whom you worship
p1334
aVwhen krishna was there his wives complained  all right
p1335
aV so there is no hope for us
p1336
aVyes
p1337
aVplease remember this  okay
p1338
aVsadhguruji this is where we open yes the platform
p1339
aVits anybody has a question this is the moment
p1340
aV my name is ananth
p1341
aVmy question is about marriage
p1342
aVdivorce
p1343
aV no no they are two different things 
p1344
aV what i see today is many youngsters like many of them they dont want to marry
p1345
aVand few of them who marry
p1346
aVthere are occasions where they are getting divorced
p1347
aVso would you like to throw some light on this situation sadhguru
p1348
aV see you need to understand the institution of marriage
p1349
aVone thing is as we said a little while ago
p1350
aVits about bringing a certain sanctity to the simple basic needs that every human being has
p1351
aVi will repeat there are physical needs
p1352
aVthere are psychological needs
p1353
aVthere are economic needs
p1354
aVemotional needs
p1355
aVsocial needs
p1356
aVvariety of needs
p1357
aVto fulfill all these things we set up an institution called marriage
p1358
aVwhere all these can be conducted in a sensible manner
p1359
aVotherwise if we did it on the streets like every other creature
p1360
aVit would turn ugly for us
p1361
aVand we will feel not good about it
p1362
aVso to bring some sense of organization
p1363
aVsome aesthetic
p1364
aVsome stability
p1365
aVbecause man and woman coming together naturally brought fresh life
p1366
aVthe nature of human life
p1367
aVthe nature of human offspring is such
p1368
aVthat because of the possibilities that a human being carries
p1369
aVit is compared to any other creature it is the most helpless life
p1370
aVwhich needs maximum amount of support
p1371
aVyou could leave a puppy on the street
p1372
aVas long as he gets food he grows up into a good dog
p1373
aVno problem
p1374
aVbut not so with a human being
p1375
aVhe doesnt need just physical support
p1376
aVhe needs variety of support and stab above all the stable situation
p1377
aVwhether there should be marriage in society or not
p1378
aVone will debate when they are eighteen because
p1379
aVphysical body is asking for freedom all right
p1380
aVat that time everybody questions 
p1381
aVis marriage really needed
p1382
aVwhy cant we just live whichever way we want
p1383
aVbut when you are three years of age you valued marriage immensely
p1384
aVa stable marriage immensely
p1385
aVisnt it so
p1386
aVyes or no
p1387
aV yes yes
p1388
aV not yours
p1389
aVyour parents
p1390
aV the parents yes 
p1391
aV when you were three four of yours
p1392
aVthree four years of age youre one hundred percent for marriage
p1393
aVagain when you become fortyfive fifty again youre hundred percent for marriage
p1394
aVbetween and eighteen and thirtyfive youre questioning the whole process 
p1395
aVokay
p1396
aV thats true 
p1397
aV im not saying marriage is the thing but do you have a better alternative
p1398
aVif you have a better alternative
p1399
aVdamn the marriage
p1400
aVbut you have not come up with a better alternative
p1401
aVbecause a stable situation is a must for a child
p1402
aVonce you have a child its a twenty year project  okay
p1403
aVthat is if they do well
p1404
aVif they dont do well its a lifelong project 
p1405
aVso if you want to get into such projects
p1406
aVat least twenty years there must be a commitment to create a stable situation
p1407
aVyour whims and fancies will change
p1408
aVyour emotions will change
p1409
aVif that is what it is dont get into such situations
p1410
aVits not compulsory for everybody to get married
p1411
aVits good young pe you were saying people are thinking whether to get married
p1412
aVim glad it is not necessary for everybody
p1413
aVbut if you get into it and if you especially if you get into children
p1414
aVyou must understand its a minimum twenty year project
p1415
aVwhether you like it or you dont like it
p1416
aVotherwise you shouldnt get into those projects
p1417
aVyou dont walk into a project
p1418
aVdrop it half way and walk away isnt it
p1419
aVthey have their benefits and they have their problems
p1420
aVits your choice but at least choose consciously
p1421
aVyou dont have to get married because everybody is getting married
p1422
aVyou dont have to talk about marriage and divorce in same breath
p1423
aVas if they come together 
p1424
aVthis is a completely an american idea
p1425
aVyoure thinking of marriage and divorce together
p1426
aVnobody thought of divorce in this country till recently isnt it
p1427
aVwhy should you ever talk about marriage and divorce in one breath
p1428
aVits its a crime
p1429
aVits really a crime to think on those lines
p1430
aVbut if it so happens
p1431
aVsomething truly went wrong between two people
p1432
aVand they have to separate that will any way inevitably happen
p1433
aVyou dont have to plan it at the time of wedding 
p1434
aV namaskaram sadhguru
p1435
aVnamaskaramjuhi mam
p1436
aVyou mentioned about survival
p1437
aVand you talked about aesthetics of life
p1438
aVi would like
p1439
aVi would request you to elaborate on aesthetics of life
p1440
aVand my second question is for my friend 
p1441
aVi dont know whether you will answer it or not
p1442
aVbut i just want to mention it over here
p1443
aVbecause she has requested me to do so
p1444
aVher question is
p1445
aVwhat is the purpose of this universe
p1446
aV oh tell your friend i didnt make it 
p1447
aV thank you so much
p1448
aV why am i being blamed for these things  i
p1449
aVthe only thing i have done is ive figured the nature of my life
p1450
aVand by figuring the nature of this life
p1451
aVi know by inference
p1452
aVevery life has happened the same way
p1453
aVnot just every life
p1454
aVthe very cosmos has happened the same way
p1455
aVif you know the nature of this life from its origin to its ultimate
p1456
aVyou know the nature of everything by inference
p1457
aVeverything thats worth knowing
p1458
aVso tell your friend i didnt make this universe
p1459
aVso dont blame me for such big things
p1460
aVi just figured my way through my life
p1461
aVand we should figure it
p1462
aVif you figure it you will see the most important thing thats happening in your life right now is
p1463
aVthat youre alive
p1464
aVnothing else
p1465
aVnot that stocks have gone up today thats not the most important thing
p1466
aVnot your love affair
p1467
aVnot this and that 
p1468
aVif you dont understand what im saying
p1469
aVsuppose tomorrow you lost im not saying you must wish
p1470
aVim not wishing you must loose
p1471
aVbut suppose tomorrow you lost half your money and youre feeling depressed
p1472
aVand your mind says i want to die
p1473
aVclose your mouth hold your nose like this  for two minutes
p1474
aVyour body says to hell with your money i want to live 
p1475
aVtomorrow you found your love affair collapsed
p1476
aVand your mind says i want to die
p1477
aVcheck  
p1478
aVthe life within you says to hell with your love affair i want to live
p1479
aVevery time you feel little suicidal or depressed
p1480
aVjust check 
p1481
aVthe life within you says to hell with all these things i want to live
p1482
aVso i want to know the most important thing thats happening to you right now is life itself
p1483
aVnot the fancy thoughts that you have
p1484
aVnot the emotions that you have
p1485
aVnot financial arrangements
p1486
aVor family arrangements
p1487
aVor whatever rubbish you have built around you
p1488
aVthese are all accessories to life
p1489
aVthese are all frills
p1490
aVfrills are so much youre missing the skirt
p1491
aVthats the whole problem with you 
p1492
aVyes
p1493
aVso much frill
p1494
aVfundamental things are forgotten 
p1495
aVso this is the most important thing
p1496
aVright now for most people life means their job
p1497
aVlife means the new house theyre building
p1498
aVlife means the car that they bought
p1499
aVlife means their wife their husband their children 
p1500
aVno
p1501
aVlife means whats throbbing here 
p1502
aVnot even your body
p1503
aVnot your mind
p1504
aVnot your thought
p1505
aVnot your emotion
p1506
aVwhat is right now throbbing here  this is life
p1507
aVbecause this is on everything else seems to be meaningful
p1508
aVif this one stops nothing around you means any damn thing to you or to anybody
p1509

aS'i think you are looking for something unnatural that happened there '
p1577
aS'thinking that could be considered a natural was '
p1578
aS'it seems i was the ready delaework'
p1579
aS'my mother went to the husband three times and came back and she gave '
p1580
aS'to hes not coming '

aS'no when it atshallye happened it happened at all'
p1582

aS'i went and tatimsartdinthappen'

p1589
aS'box'
p1590
aS'i i of his ive educated'

p1592
aS'and the question that you ask king as'
p1593

p1594
aS'all of the brother by somebody you '
p1595
aS'see the gender epesioni '

aS'pinductway'
p1598
aS'especially in the west i will see '
p1599
aS'out of christian '
p1600
aS'josh'
p1601
aS'very common words'
p1602
aS'i think its absolutely the dipolusandhumiliating'
p1603
aS'that the human being has to be brought up'
p1604
aS'you bring up cat okay'
p1605
aS'you dont bring up at him in being'
p1606
aS'a human being is supposed to blossom by his own niche'
p1607
aS'that is why he is on the top of the pile'
p1608
aS'at least on this planet in their reducionaescale'
p1609
aS'and most human beings dont seem to understand that '
p1610
aS'are they are not allowed to understand that by a whole lot of people'
p1611
aS'and they need to be brought up'
p1612
aS'bringing up means somebody is mouldinyour'
p1613
aS'molingmens its a pleaded tim in shape '
p1614
aS'and no flavor the blossoms is the same way as a '
p1615
aS'the one which blosamdestivy'
p1616
aS'but a more means is always going to be the same '
p1617
aS'no'
p1618
aS'the idea of making a males that we want to have the same form again'
p1619
aS'and again and again'
p1620
aS'right now genderly that seems to be the work'
p1621
aS'and fortunately after calentdeucationsistem'
p1622
aS'the so all religions that are operating in the world'
p1623
aS'and of course the family'
p1624
aS'they want you to be in a certain more'
p1625
aS'they do on you to bloom like a wild flower '
p1626
aS'rate of anything fresh happening among them '
p1627
aS'and something that tdisfamilia'
p1628
aS'they dont want something and familiar to be brown among them'
p1629
aS'so if you have ciccomdtothatsystem'
p1630
aS'then yes you be more into saidnpom'
p1631
aS'if you allow you humanity to blood'
p1632
aS'and see you dont belong to any more '
p1633
aS'is the beauty of being human that there is now a particular way to be'
p1634
aS'if you were to do it would be one way '

aS'if youre a sefouwouldbinodoafyou'

p2996
aS'where you just one'
p2997
aS"this is speaking from that's very"
p2998
aS'i was a normal \xe0\xa4\xac'
p2999
aS'that i dint come in a box'
p3000
aS'my my mother head her no no'
p3001
aS'now you know'
p3002
aS"come from the movies that i can't help thinking"
p3003
aS'was that like it is in story books'
p3004
aS'that a venerable says came to your home'
p3005
aS'and when he looked at your mother he said'
p3006
aS'the'
p3007
aS'there is going to be born a guru'
p3008
aS'he will write and his own bar'
p3009
aS'you and that other you you also going like this'
p3010
aS'no he was it like that would have'
p3011
aS'that how was your child hold'
p3012
aS"i don't think they all came to listen my mother's labor pains"
p3013
aS'now i am really'
p3014
aS'three that we are all here'
p3015
aS'but you know the way you think'
p3016
aS'we wait to hear what you have to say'
p3017
aS'we have all when children'
p3018
aS'we will grow up with'
p3019
aS"we've grown up and been educated in school who is then"
p3020
aS'but i find or we have think'
p3021
aS'sing how are your being where you can'
p3022
aS'like almost system at times'
p3023
ag1558
aS'so what is that all begin'
p3024
aS"i think you're looking for something and nature that happened there"
p3025
aS'thing that could be considered unnatural was'
p3026
aS'it seems i was very delayed birth'
p3027
aS'my mother went to hospital three times and came back and she gave'
p3028
aS'that he is not coming'
p3029
aS'and when it actually happened it happened at home'
p3030
aS'my father being a position that is not possible is'
p3031
aS'have to be the hospital three'
p3032
aS"to see went and three times it didn't happen"
p3033
aS'they did everything possible and she gave up'
p3034
aS'so it happened at home so that'
p3035
aS'the only reasonable and natural thing everything'
p3036
aS"this is natural birth i din't come"
p3037
aS'in a box'
p3038
aS'and i refuse to be educated'
p3039
aS'so what its'
p3040
aS'i am in the question that you are asking is'
p3041
aS'do people grow up and blows'
p3042
aS'or are they brought by somebody you'
p3043
aS'see the general expression is have'
p3044
aS'it brought up in this place i was'
p3045
aS'rut up in that way'
p3046
aS'especially in the west you will see i'
p3047
aS'the broad of question i was'
p3048
aS'rt of'
p3049
aS'is a very common words'
p3050
aS'i think its absolutely reckless and'
p3051
aS'that a human being has to be brought up'
p3052
aS'you bring up cattle ok'
p3053
aS"you don't bring up"
p3054
aS'him and doing it suppose to blossom by'
p3055
aS'that is why he is on the top of the palm'
p3056
aS'at least in this planet in the evolutionary scale'
p3057
aS"and most seamen being don't seem to understand that"
p3058
aS"or they're not allowed to understand that by whole are a people"
p3059
aS'and they need to be brought up'
p3060
aS'bringing up means somebody is molding you'
p3061
aS'molding means its a pre determined shape'
p3062
aS'no flower that blossoms is the same way as in'
p3063
aS'or the one which blogging rest today'
p3064
aS'but the mold means its always going to be the same if you'
p3065
aS'k a mold'
p3066
aS'the idea of making a mould is that we want to have the same form again'
p3067
aS'in again and'
p3068
aS'right now generally that seems to be the work'
p3069
aS'and fortunately after current education system'
p3070
aS"that's so called religion that are operating in the world"
p3071
aS'and of course the family'
p3072
aS'they want you to be in a certain more'
p3073
aS"they don't want you to blossom like a wild flower because"
p3074
aS'no freight of anything fresh happening among them the'
p3075
aS'you want something that is familiar'
p3076
aS"they don't want something unfamiliar to be brand among them"
p3077
aS'so if you have second to that system'
p3078
aS'then yes you have been moulded into certain form'
p3079
aS'if you allow you he-man d to blossom'
p3080
aS"then you will see you don't belong there anymore"
p3081
aS'this is the beauty of being human that there is no a particular way to be'
p3082
aS'if you were a dog you would be one way if you'
p3083
aS'cattle you would be one'
p3084
aS'where if you are a sheep you would be another way if you'
p3085
aS'bird you would be another way grass grace hopper another way'
p3086
aS'but to be human means there is no particular way'
p3087
aS'what is human is not defying not described'
p3088
aS'it is it is just that'
p3089
aS'for every other creature on this planet'
p3090
aS'nahi sir two two lines'
p3091
aS'within that they have to play there again'
p3092
aS'sorry human being only the bottom line is wrong the'
p3093
aS'he is no top line'
p3094
aS'but socialy people are trying to draw a top line for themselves'
p3095
aS'but nature is not drawn a top line for you'
p3096
aS'its a limitless possibility and'
p3097
aS'this is what is freaking human being right now'
p3098
aS"because they can't decide what they can eat to be"
p3099
aS'they are trying to be like somebody else'
p3100
aS'only bottom line is set top line has been removed'
p3101
aS'this is evolution'
p3102
aS"but wait we still didn't quiet get to"
p3103
aS'how was it when you were a child'
p3104
aS'were you were you put into a school to go the systematic way'
p3105
aS'and they will keep up'
p3106
aS'do i look that is'
p3107
aS'in sab mila'
p3108
aS'actually you know when i go and stand in the line'
p3109
aS'the immigration lines in particularly in a mega they look'
p3110
aS'sensex can i speak english'
p3111
ag1558
aS'because i have that educated look its not easy'
p3112
aS'do you know'
p3113
aS'do you know what it takes to remain an educated'
p3114
aS'education is just twenty years of going somewhere and getting one certificate to re'
p3115
aS'me an educated its very difficult'
p3116
aS'because from the day you are born'
p3117
aS'your parents every other adult the school the damn thing'
p3118
aS'every body is trying to educate you'
p3119
aS'about some'
p3120
aS"that's not worked in their life"
p3121
aS'and then did you also like we all went to these confused teenage year of'
p3122
aS'not really knowing where veer going i mean'
p3123
aS'did you clearly know your past'
p3124
aS'not to talk'
p3125
aS'i was a right from three or four years of a'
p3126
aS'i was always i million questions hanging in my head'
p3127
aS'i have a question about everything'
p3128
aS'everything everything'
p3129
aS'questions means very fundamental questions about'
p3130
aS'tell my own'
p3131
aS'so when i was three four'
p3132
aS'he s f eight suddenly i realised i know nothing'
p3133
aS'no nothing means'
p3134
aS'somebody ki usmein glass water i do not know what is what'
p3135
aS'i know how to use it i know if'
p3136
aS'a trinket to quench my thirst and so many other ways'
p3137
aS'but i do not know what is'
p3138
aS'achcha i am saying even today you do not know what is what'
p3139
aS'so only thing available in all three states on the planet'
p3140
aS'three two third so the plan'
p3141
aS'to what are two third of your body is what'
p3142
aS'if you think life we think water'
p3143
aS'but do you know what it is'
p3144
aS'with all the scientific exploration'
p3145
aS'we do not even know a single at anything its entirty'
p3146
aS'today our i d have'
p3147
aS'learning how to use everything'
p3148
aS'yes we'
p3149
aS'know how to use an atom'
p3150
aS'you know how to break it'
p3151
aS'know how to fuse it'
p3152
aS'but we really do not know what it is'
p3153
aS'any one thing tennis thing in the creation'
p3154
aS'we do not know any authority this is'
p3155
aS'perfect flight'
p3156
aS'well even something simple as what you started with saint'
p3157
aS'that looking at worked i mean'
p3158
aS'straight away i was taught what h two o'
p3159
aS'and what it can do when it you can'
p3160
aS'six set with colors and it becomes that you can'
p3161
aS'wingate and its quaint their third'
p3162
aS'spread never looked dated and said you know'
p3163
aS"i don't really know what is"
p3164
aS'because nobody looks at anything'
p3165
aS'see everybody is looking like this'
p3166
aS'nobody has any attention for a piece of life here'
p3167
aS'they are like this'
p3168
aS'if you pay attention to one life'
p3169
aS'one blade of good'
p3170
aS'one great half'
p3171
aS'one human being'
p3172
aS'something else will happen'
p3173
aS"that's why we said life and la"
p3174
aS'because if you pay attention to one human being'
p3175
aS'some love will happen with in your ok'
p3176
aS'if you miss life at least some emotion in the direction must happened to you'
p3177
aS'that will happen only if you pay attention to one'
p3178
aS'if you are looking at like this these'
p3179
aS'this is big my fashion because you are in love and facebook'
p3180
aS'you will love the whole'
p3181
aS'if to love and'
p3182
aS'ing if you want to love won him and being it cost life'
p3183
aS"to allow the whole humenity doesn't cost anything"
p3184
aS'see even better to love god'
p3185
aS'he is always easy to love somebody was not here on'
p3186
aS'its so'
p3187
aS'but if you have to love some but you who is sitting next to you right now'
p3188
aS'it cost'
p3189
aS'if you know how difficult it is to love someone who is next you right now'
p3190
aS'how easy it is to love someone who is dead or who is in heaven'
p3191
aS"isn't it a"
p3192
aS'on its face it'
p3193
aS'because if you have to love one'
p3194
aS'one thing is you have to pay attention'
p3195
aS'without attention it will not happen'
p3196
aS'another one you have to give up something that is you'
p3197
aS'to accommodate'
p3198
aS'otherwise i will not have'
p3199
aS'the english expression is very'
p3200
aS'you must fall in love'
p3201
aS'you cannot rise in love'
p3202
aS'you cannot stand in'
p3203
aS'now you cannot fly in love'
p3204
aS'you have to form'
p3205
aS"something of view should form and why's it will not work"
p3206
aS'you will not know it'
p3207
aS'so you want to have a fake sense of life'
p3208
aS"then you don't pay attention to any"
p3209
aS'think everything is information'
p3210
aS'nothing is a living experience'
p3211
aS'everything is from the text book or from this in my arsenal internet'
p3212
aS'nothing is from last experience'
p3213
aS'we are doing more and more today of that'
p3214
aS'sirf guruji you just mentioned love'
p3215
aS'said today it is about life and love i would like to know'
p3216
aS'for us sir is maybe love your family me'
p3217
aS'members who ever it could be'
p3218
aS'i i y i ask you this is because this so many worse'
p3219

p3220
aS'some teacher'
p3221
aS'some good'
p3222
aS'to some guys will say you know you'
p3223
aS'can love but you must be the text'
p3224
aS'you must'
p3225
aS'love but it cannot be'
p3226
aS'it should be unconditional'
p3227
aS'so this versions away'
p3228
aS'i just want to know'
p3229
ag1558
aS'they can do the simple way of make you keep coming back to me is'
p3230
aS'to give you something that you cannot do'
p3231
aS'to give you a teaching which you can never do'
p3232
aS'you must love but you must be detached'
p3233
aS'now you have to keep coming back to me for consultation'
p3234
ag1558
ag1558
aS'i am saying throw your self into your love affair and die and to it'
p3235
aS'something will happen'
p3236
aS'something worth while will happen if your willing to die in the process'
p3237
aS'not just anything with'
p3238
aS'will you work for your life on your lap of whatever'
p3239
aS'if you do not know how to throw your entire self into it'
p3240
aS'you will never know the taste of what it is'
p3241
aS'love but be detached'
p3242
aS'but what you want to love them'
p3243
aS'only because you want to include somebody as a part of your life'
p3244
aS'what of your self thats why you love'
p3245
aS"no i love but i i'm detached"
p3246
aS'this means you have to come back to consultation ever'
p3247
aS'its like a psychotic jaam'
p3248
aS'everyday you have to come and sit on the cars'
p3249
aS'you need treatment and there is a fee so'
p3250
aS'what ok'
p3251
aS'right so you can love and be attached'
p3252
aS'no i think say that'
p3253
aS"jab tak okay i'm coming back for consultations please"
p3254
aS'so what did you'
p3255
aS'i only say hain'
p3256
aS'see what is this need for love in a'
p3257
aS'must understand'
p3258
aS'a human being'
p3259
ag1558
aS'a human being is longing to be something more than what they are right now'
p3260
aS'if this finds a simple basic physical'
p3261
aS'we call this quality'
p3262
aS'six four lemons just the'
p3263
aS'physically you are trying to make something which is not you apart of your self'
p3264
aS'but of sure moments you may succeed'
p3265
aS'if you try this mentally it gets labeled as greed'
p3266
aS'conquest maybe simply shopping'
p3267
aS'shopping shopping'
p3268
ag1558
aS'some people go for conquest which source in'
p3269
aS'some people go with cheque books and cash you know credit cards'
p3270
aS'the thing is you want to include something which is not a part of you is yourself'
p3271
aS'that is a whole effort'
p3272
aS'whether you want money or wealth or you want to occupy any'
p3273
aS'what is it'
p3274
aS'something that is not you you want to make it yours'
p3275
aS'yours is an effort to make it a part of yourself'
p3276
aS'if it happens emotionally on the emotional level if you try the'
p3277
aS'we call this a love affair'
p3278
aS"you're trying to make somebody who is not a part of you"
p3279
aS'of yourself emotionally'
p3280
aS'jindabad'
p3281
aS'if you do it conciously we call this yoga'
p3282
aS'yoga means union'
p3283
aS'so all this efforts are fine a'
p3284
aS'thing has its own beauty but has its own limitation'
p3285
aS'when you understand the limitations of all the other'
p3286
aS'its nothing right or wrong about it'
p3287
aS'it is just that it will work'
p3288
aS'it will not work for always'
p3289
aS'when you realize that you contest try to include'
p3290
aS'when you conciously become an inclusive process if you'
p3291
aS'here if you'
p3292
aS"experience everything as yourself then we say you're a yogi ok"
p3293
aS'so this is a love affair sixes four'
p3294
aS'sir something you said at the end which'
p3295
aS'i would like to ask you again'
p3296
aS'it said love'
p3297
aS"i can't understand how i can love everybody in this"
p3298
aS'so you can not'
p3299
aS'this some people you can cla'
p3300
aS'i can well see how there in'
p3301
aS'so how is that how do you include everybody in your love'
p3302
aS'because you are looking at love as something that comes to'
p3303
aS'you or you and to the process of'
p3304
aS'only because you appreciate a particular quality'
p3305
aS'a ship of some but is now was are the shape of their my'
p3306

p3637
aS"that's what it is"
p3638
aS"or every creature it's but we can eat"

aS'every creature has sexual'
p3641

aS'if you are not conscious about it'
p3657
aS'everything can turn'
p3658
aS'everything can become nasty'
p3659
aS'so it is this which sets you apart from every other creature'

p3777
aS'is so heavy and so'
p3778
aS'nobody has ever been used to this kind of influence before okay na'

p3787
aS'nobody knows where it is including the young people is'
p3788
aS'just a mix of things'
p3789
aS'so this is because of a sudden on slot of information and communication'
p3790
aS'which is not for seses whether its good or bad it is'
p3791
aS'st that definitely this level of information'
p3792
aS'when i say information'

p3817
aS'you will see this is not my wish'
p3818
aS'but this is something that i see the way peoples minds there working'
p3819
aS'in the way they are being laid with information'
p3820
aS'i am not by any standard se pacimistic person'
p3821
aS'but i am just saying this'
p3822
aS'if this level of information continues and it will multiply many fort'
p3823
aS'for the coming generations'
p3824
aS'you should not miss'
p3825
aS'in the next fifty two hundred years'
p3826
aS'yeh fifty percent of the hymn in population chose to commit so he'
p3827
aS'you should not be'
p3828
aS'because that is what will happen to the mind'
p3829
aS'somebody is clapping look this is popular'
p3830
aS'no you will just flats the'
p3831
aS'word that no i am sending'
p3832
aS'like today something today'
p3833
aS'this the'
p3834
aS'more people commit suicide in this world'
p3835
aS'than all the wars in murders and accidents manage to q'
p3836
aS'so more people are on self help already'
p3837
aS'then murders were moungers bad drivers everything put together'
p3838
aS'more people are on self help'

aS'i know the nature of mind absolutely because i know my'
p3841
aS'i know how it works what it can handle what it can not do'

aS"that's the reason why i don't have to read peoples book"
p3844
aS'books are listen to their entire thing you'
p3845
aS'they say one sentence i know what their mind is'
p3846
aS'because i know the structure of human mind and'
p3847
aS"otherwise i won't be who i am"
p3848
aS'so i am saying'
p3849
aS'this if this level of information on slot continues at the same pace or at higher pace'
p3850
aS'it is possible in the next few years'
p3851
aS'this will definitely lead to wanting to terminate yourself'
p3852
aS'because there will be nothing to live for'
p3853
aS'there is no joy and excitement about'
p3854
aS'you please watch your chal raha hai'
p3855

p3862
aS'quar fifteen year old kids chess board nothing is'
p3863
aS'yes they are all on ipads iphones because'
p3864
aS'we are talking about love and life'

p3866
aS'you thought this is your life and you want to willing to die for it'
p3867
aS'whether you write for it or not but at least at that time you thought you will die for it ok today'

p3869
aS'we just means nothing'
p3870
aS'i m not saying they should have it or not have it'
p3871
aS'all i m saying is this will lead to an overload on the mind'
p3872
aS'and suddenly a human being will think why am i here'
p3873
aS'you know that big experience question'
p3874
aS'to be or not to be'
p3875
aS'this not the'

p3898
aS'if you touch life within you then its an explosion in a fancy'
p3899
aS'when such a thing never happens to you'
p3900

aS'satguru g here we have a few questions'
p4072
aS'first question is from prabha sundara sundar sen'
p4073
aS'where and how do we draw the line between loving unconditionally'
p4074
aS'and becoming a dormate'
p4075
aS'so we need to understand this'
p4076
aS'its being right now bastard is now is generally a mutual benefit scheme'
p4077
aS'you give me this i will give you that'
p4078
aS"if you don't give me that i don't give you this"
p4079
aS'this is not said but its done'
p4080
aS'okay'
p4081
aS"it's done i sent it"
p4082
aS'its not said'
p4083
aS'to human being have physical psychological emotional economic'
p4084
aS'and various other kinds of needs'
p4085
aS'to fulfil these things'
p4086
aS'when you say i love you'
p4087
aS'in of making this things ugly needs that we'
p4088
aS'too ugly transactions that we have to do you give me this you give me that'
p4089
aS'to bring some aesthetic beauty to this transaction'
p4090
aS'we coated with a certain amount of sweetness of emotion'
p4091
aS'which we call as love'
p4092
aS'where the transactions happen most'
p4093
aS'smoothly because once we are human somehow doing basic transactions in a basic way makes us feel ugly'
p4094
aS'if you take food with both your hands and it it its'
p4095
aS'we want two eight in'
p4096
aS'similarly to fulfill our physical needs'
p4097
aS'personal nahi sikhana ick needs we have arrangements'
p4098
aS'where we can conduct this in a more aesthetic manner'
p4099
aS'i am not saying its right or wrong this is the fact of five'
p4100
aS'so this level of la'
p4101
aS'i called this'
p4102
aS"this is enough for to fulfill the domestic needs of one's"
p4103
aS'you know for two people to live together'
p4104
aS'the full for their needs to'
p4105
aS'are you'
p4106
aS'to raise them domestic level of love affair people can have'
p4107
aS'but if people want to have a love affair which will bring them to an ultimate union'
p4108
aS'then not many people are competent to do that'
p4109
aS'not people not many people are ready to have that kind of a love affair'
p4110
aS'where it will make to lives into one'
p4111
aS'two becomes actually one in experience'
p4112
aS'that will need something more'
p4113
aS'most people are competent of using love to fulfill the domestic needs'
p4114
aS'but to go beyond that they are not ready'
p4115
aS'i when i say they are not ready either nine'
p4116
aS'i talk about this person or that question'
p4117
aS'so when one is ready and another is'
p4118
aS'artery or one is making an effort and another vision have the effort'
p4119
aS'then it feels like somebody is becoming a door mat'
p4120
aS'that is what it is that it feels like they are being'
p4121
aS'but our war one who is longing to become use love as a way of ultimate union'
p4122
aS'should not be bothered about being dormate this and that'
p4123
aS'in india we have a culture'
p4124
aS'where by choice people name them selves as'
p4125
aS'alex you know ramdas krishna das this that'
p4126
aS"that that's what is"
p4127
aS'they are only saying i am a slick'
p4128
aS'i am a dormate'
p4129
aS'i want to be a dormate'
p4130
aS'they are not saying am i afraid i will \xe0\xa4\xac'
p4131
aS'used as a dormate they sing i want to be a dormate'
p4132
aS'so this is a kind of love that they are wanting to use to'
p4133
aS'use for ultimate union'
p4134
aS'this is not for domestic'
p4135
aS'so if you are looking for ultimate union then love is a different'
p4136
aS'if you are looking for conducting of domestic affairs'
p4137
aS'then you must manage dignity'
p4138
aS'who gets what'
p4139
aS'anybody is using more than what they should then'
p4140
aS"if you don't give me that i don't give you this okay"
p4141
aS'otherwise if you are looking for ultimate union you'
p4142
aS"should not think of all this things that's a different affair"
p4143
aS"that's not for not much social thing"
p4144
aS'if you fall in love its you become warner about this'
p4145
ag1558
aS'without becoming vulnerable there is no love'
p4146
aS'you have to fall'
p4147
aS'when you fall somebody may raise you'
p4148
aS'personal body me walk over you'
p4149
aS'he has'
p4150
aS'but the thing is the'
p4151
aS'experience of your life is beautiful'
p4152
aS'because you fell not because they raised you'
p4153
aS'not because you wa aapke over you'
p4154
aS'because you could actually have the sense of a bend in u two four'
p4155
aS'that was the beauty of your love of fact'
p4156
aS'not what they gave you what they did to you this no'
p4157
aS'the beauty was you sat alone and you think you really love this person so much'
p4158
aS'you willing to die that was'
p4159
aS'the most beautiful moment'
p4160
aS'not the moment they gave you a big gift'
p4161
aS'of the moment they gave you a diamond ring not'
p4162
aS'for the moment they said this and that about you know'
p4163
aS'you just sat here and you will in to die that was the moment'
p4164
aS'not just a'
p4165
aS'that you are willing to be the dust on their feet okay'
p4166
aS'i am not saying you should be like that'
p4167
aS'i am saying where love trains formed itself and your devotion'
p4168
aS'if you fall in love its help you become where you'
p4169
aS'but there are still some straits of sanity in love affairs that you can recover'
p4170
aS'but if you become a devotee there is no sanity left and you can not recover'
p4171
aS'so before you trade such a land'
p4172
aS'you must see whether you are for it or not'
p4173
aS'what are your goals first of all'
p4174
aS'if your goal is to make a life a caution'
p4175
aS'a very measured love affair is good but'
p4176
aS'your your your thing is you want to dissolve into the process of la'
p4177
aS"if you don't want to have a good life"
p4178
aS'you are not planning to have a good laugh'
p4179
aS'you just want to become explosion of life'
p4180
aS"you don't care what you get and what you don't"
p4181
aS'it then you become a devotee'
p4182
aS'devotion means it should intention to dissolve in your objective'
p4183
aS'so devotee is not expecting whether i will become a dormate or a crown on somebody had'
p4184
aS'whatever i become as long as i can touch your feet or head or whatever'
p4185
aS'its fine with me'
p4186
aS'so the'
p4187
aS'sir different state of'
p4188
aS"i don't think"
p4189
aS'some but he was looking for domestic level of love of that should even ask that question'
p4190
aS'we have one question from the social media the facebook'
p4191
aS'amit madan wants to know'
p4192
aS'in this matrialistic as the real feeling of love is disappearing from our life'

aS'how can we real first the real feeling of love in our own life and in others'
p4195
aS'you get about this'
p4196
aS'if you'

p4206
aS'if you love somebody its a fikal happening'

p4268
aS"but why can't we just live which ever way you want"
