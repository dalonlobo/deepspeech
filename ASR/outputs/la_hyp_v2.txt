good evening everyone good evening everyone nobody saying anything now they are all here but they very sadly they all waiting for it also be in and let me tell you i have to kal sir as i came on before this i was smiles bit as are amount to the stage my heart is beating really fast so while guruji was saying i was saying to myself i must be relax this is the time when and with my guru i must be relaxed this is it so yes i will come you begin by thanking you sadh guruji for giving me this surtanty b in conversation with isha foundation thank you very much that when we are talking about of love and life heart beating is a good thing karpin yes that is a good think its show them a life and in love and about to begin discount station and guruji i want to say and and send it your in the engineering then i have same i have radio and everywhere your brilliant views on various issues it could be from making of nation to the making of a toy car from the running of household to running of parliament you have really interviews on every issue that one can ever question yet i know very little about you and if you know he has a brilliant mind vision for link up whether that's out of the box thinking so this and so in lightning i am fascinated and i want to know about your life and i would like to know i mean where you just one this is speaking from that's very i was a normal à¤¬ that i dint come in a box my my mother head her no no now you know come from the movies that i can't help thinking was that like it is in story books that a venerable says came to your home and when he looked at your mother he said the there is going to be born a guru he will write and his own bar you and that other you you also going like this no he was it like that would have that how was your child hold i don't think they all came to listen my mother's labor pains now i am really three that we are all here but you know the way you think we wait to hear what you have to say we have all when children we will grow up with we've grown up and been educated in school who is then but i find or we have think sing how are your being where you can like almost system at times  so what is that all begin i think you're looking for something and nature that happened there thing that could be considered unnatural was it seems i was very delayed birth my mother went to hospital three times and came back and she gave that he is not coming and when it actually happened it happened at home my father being a position that is not possible is have to be the hospital three to see went and three times it didn't happen they did everything possible and she gave up so it happened at home so that the only reasonable and natural thing everything this is natural birth i din't come in a box and i refuse to be educated so what its i am in the question that you are asking is do people grow up and blows or are they brought by somebody you see the general expression is have it brought up in this place i was rut up in that way especially in the west you will see i the broad of question i was rt of is a very common words i think its absolutely reckless and that a human being has to be brought up you bring up cattle ok you don't bring up him and doing it suppose to blossom by that is why he is on the top of the palm at least in this planet in the evolutionary scale and most seamen being don't seem to understand that or they're not allowed to understand that by whole are a people and they need to be brought up bringing up means somebody is molding you molding means its a pre determined shape no flower that blossoms is the same way as in or the one which blogging rest today but the mold means its always going to be the same if you k a mold the idea of making a mould is that we want to have the same form again in again and right now generally that seems to be the work and fortunately after current education system that's so called religion that are operating in the world and of course the family they want you to be in a certain more they don't want you to blossom like a wild flower because no freight of anything fresh happening among them the you want something that is familiar they don't want something unfamiliar to be brand among them so if you have second to that system then yes you have been moulded into certain form if you allow you he-man d to blossom then you will see you don't belong there anymore this is the beauty of being human that there is no a particular way to be if you were a dog you would be one way if you cattle you would be one where if you are a sheep you would be another way if you bird you would be another way grass grace hopper another way but to be human means there is no particular way what is human is not defying not described it is it is just that for every other creature on this planet nahi sir two two lines within that they have to play there again sorry human being only the bottom line is wrong the he is no top line but socialy people are trying to draw a top line for themselves but nature is not drawn a top line for you its a limitless possibility and this is what is freaking human being right now because they can't decide what they can eat to be they are trying to be like somebody else only bottom line is set top line has been removed this is evolution but wait we still didn't quiet get to how was it when you were a child were you were you put into a school to go the systematic way and they will keep up do i look that is in sab mila actually you know when i go and stand in the line the immigration lines in particularly in a mega they look sensex can i speak english  because i have that educated look its not easy do you know do you know what it takes to remain an educated education is just twenty years of going somewhere and getting one certificate to re me an educated its very difficult because from the day you are born your parents every other adult the school the damn thing every body is trying to educate you about some that's not worked in their life and then did you also like we all went to these confused teenage year of not really knowing where veer going i mean did you clearly know your past not to talk i was a right from three or four years of a i was always i million questions hanging in my head i have a question about everything everything everything questions means very fundamental questions about tell my own so when i was three four he s f eight suddenly i realised i know nothing no nothing means somebody ki usmein glass water i do not know what is what i know how to use it i know if a trinket to quench my thirst and so many other ways but i do not know what is achcha i am saying even today you do not know what is what so only thing available in all three states on the planet three two third so the plan to what are two third of your body is what if you think life we think water but do you know what it is with all the scientific exploration we do not even know a single at anything its entirty today our i d have learning how to use everything yes we know how to use an atom you know how to break it know how to fuse it but we really do not know what it is any one thing tennis thing in the creation we do not know any authority this is perfect flight well even something simple as what you started with saint that looking at worked i mean straight away i was taught what h two o and what it can do when it you can six set with colors and it becomes that you can wingate and its quaint their third spread never looked dated and said you know i don't really know what is because nobody looks at anything see everybody is looking like this nobody has any attention for a piece of life here they are like this if you pay attention to one life one blade of good one great half one human being something else will happen that's why we said life and la because if you pay attention to one human being some love will happen with in your ok if you miss life at least some emotion in the direction must happened to you that will happen only if you pay attention to one if you are looking at like this these this is big my fashion because you are in love and facebook you will love the whole if to love and ing if you want to love won him and being it cost life to allow the whole humenity doesn't cost anything see even better to love god he is always easy to love somebody was not here on its so but if you have to love some but you who is sitting next to you right now it cost if you know how difficult it is to love someone who is next you right now how easy it is to love someone who is dead or who is in heaven isn't it a on its face it because if you have to love one one thing is you have to pay attention without attention it will not happen another one you have to give up something that is you to accommodate otherwise i will not have the english expression is very you must fall in love you cannot rise in love you cannot stand in now you cannot fly in love you have to form something of view should form and why's it will not work you will not know it so you want to have a fake sense of life then you don't pay attention to any think everything is information nothing is a living experience everything is from the text book or from this in my arsenal internet nothing is from last experience we are doing more and more today of that sirf guruji you just mentioned love said today it is about life and love i would like to know for us sir is maybe love your family me members who ever it could be i i y i ask you this is because this so many worse must this then i really want to get to it some teacher some good to some guys will say you know you can love but you must be the text you must love but it cannot be it should be unconditional so this versions away i just want to know  they can do the simple way of make you keep coming back to me is to give you something that you cannot do to give you a teaching which you can never do you must love but you must be detached now you have to keep coming back to me for consultation   i am saying throw your self into your love affair and die and to it something will happen something worth while will happen if your willing to die in the process not just anything with will you work for your life on your lap of whatever if you do not know how to throw your entire self into it you will never know the taste of what it is love but be detached but what you want to love them only because you want to include somebody as a part of your life what of your self thats why you love no i love but i i'm detached this means you have to come back to consultation ever its like a psychotic jaam everyday you have to come and sit on the cars you need treatment and there is a fee so what ok right so you can love and be attached no i think say that jab tak okay i'm coming back for consultations please so what did you i only say hain see what is this need for love in a must understand a human being  a human being is longing to be something more than what they are right now if this finds a simple basic physical we call this quality six four lemons just the physically you are trying to make something which is not you apart of your self but of sure moments you may succeed if you try this mentally it gets labeled as greed conquest maybe simply shopping shopping shopping  some people go for conquest which source in some people go with cheque books and cash you know credit cards the thing is you want to include something which is not a part of you is yourself that is a whole effort whether you want money or wealth or you want to occupy any what is it something that is not you you want to make it yours yours is an effort to make it a part of yourself if it happens emotionally on the emotional level if you try the we call this a love affair you're trying to make somebody who is not a part of you of yourself emotionally jindabad if you do it conciously we call this yoga yoga means union so all this efforts are fine a thing has its own beauty but has its own limitation when you understand the limitations of all the other its nothing right or wrong about it it is just that it will work it will not work for always when you realize that you contest try to include when you conciously become an inclusive process if you here if you experience everything as yourself then we say you're a yogi ok so this is a love affair sixes four sir something you said at the end which i would like to ask you again it said love i can't understand how i can love everybody in this so you can not this some people you can cla i can well see how there in so how is that how do you include everybody in your love because you are looking at love as something that comes to you or you and to the process of only because you appreciate a particular quality a ship of some but is now was are the shape of their my or their thought or their emotion or the way they speak the way they do things or the way they relate to you something okay the many many things it is based on something that is acceptable to you if they do something that is not acceptable to you love from yes now what i am saying we if i wanted to look at this whether love happens to you or hate happens you anger happens to you major happens to you joy happens to you it won't be happens within new yes kitne baar people say love is in the air no because you are feeling very pleasant in your emotion suddenly air feels vibrant did always being you missed it all your life now you are beginning to feel it okay so what ever human love or hate whatever whatever happens only within you what i am saying is at least what happens within you must happen by your choice concal you must be able to make it happen if you are able to if your experience what is happening within you is happening by chance what is the problem it only happens within you love is not a relationship a relationship is a different thing love is a certain sweetness of your emotion whether you look at a tree or a dog or a man or a woman or a child or just a why can't you look at it lovingly because its not about loving its about the sweetness of your emotion if you emotions are sweet what ever you look at you'll look at it right now you have a nasty emotion whatever you look at you look at it in a different way so you have always associated love with somebody no no no this is not about some bat love is not something that you do it is something that you can become if you will think you can bake now you can make your and option in your very sweet space you if you make your if you make your body very pleasant it becomes pleasure if you sit here it can be great pleasure just sitting here and breathing if your mind becomes pleasant we say this is joy if your emotions becomes pleasant we say this is love if you are very linage is become pleasant we say this is bridge for this this is if you say lendings become pleasant we call that success now you're calling your success with somebody as love that's a mistake you have a success story with somebody that is have created pleasant ness in that most here between you and let's say five ten people around you you're calling that love no that is actually success because that needs lots of management  yes sir no yes it does yes but for you to be loving there is no management if you just make your emotions sweet your emotions are sweet and it's beautiful meal we like this its not about anybody if somebody comes we can share it if nobody comes you can sit here with the as close and still bill thing what is the problem it is not about somebody it's not an action it is not something that you do it is something that you can become its a its a lovely it is not dedicated right is i mean you really have to practice their because i m thinking this what exactly i am saying if it is an ex and action comes to perfection with practice only if its an action am saying love is not an act his health and at all acting healthy right now  i know you are an actor but are you actually have the  so health is because we have done certain things and health is isn't it oh we have not done certain you have benefit na  or we will give an à¤¬ if you eat bad if you look bad you won't be helping theek hai done certain things to manage or help similarly if you do certain things you you can manage the pleasant less of your mind if you do certain other things you can manage this places of your m option if you do said other things you can manage the places if you're very life energy this is things that you can do now what you can do internally you are trying to manage what can be done here within you you are trying to manage by creating an atmosphere around you which is a very difficult thing to do because outside will never happen hundred percent the way you wanted to some extent we can manage we can't do all of it by because them many forces satguru g you said something was and you said you to certain things for yourself one your given health and then how you maintain it is you eat well exercise and you remain healthy now to be loving when in a house or any situation maybe outside like you said outside forces are not pleasant it doesn't come easily to then just be love so what is the practice to become that way to train yourself to be that way i want to remove this idea from your mind you believe you need to ka this practice means u r trying to perfect perfect and action percent to be they are all time yes yes that is not an act no not an act no what so i i don't want to go back to the movie issue that you ri so excepting because no its not about right now do you want to keep your mind your thought process pleasant or nasty what is your ideally pleasant just tell me present next the thinking about this is no i m trying to think shall i pakshi main se  okay i am going to place your okay they like my work okay right any him in being choice them services definitely plus  hey mind emoting everything and surrounding you want a yes so why is it not place it soundings are not pleasant because of many things yes a if your thought and emotion are not pleasant its harley you yes surrounding not entirely meet so many we have to manage them we have to tell them no are always how we successful with everything around us you know different people have different levels of competent to manage the outside not all of us have the same what to say the skill to manage the out side but inside your emotion and your thought why is it not happening you we this is something we have to look at this has to be freman being has to address this at least your thought and your emotions must happen the way you want it's like on a certain day a lady went to sleep a lady went to sleep you have sleep she had a dream i think aapne or there are two state of people nobody sleep right so that i could pick on you i am just looking if i can see she went to sleep up there and in her dream she had a dream in her dream she saw hunk of a man standing in that corner and then he started coming closer and closer and cl so he came so close she could even feel his breath she trembled not in fear and then she asked what will you do the man said well lady is your dream  what's happening in your mind is your bloody dream now the problem with life face not that life is not happening the way u va even your dream is not happening the way you want its a problem i am saying at least fix this at least let the dream happen the way you want if you are dreaming the way you want right now your thought and your emotion would be pleasant isn't it she is put it fixing the world is an other thing that said this and gain let me it's a lot of skill this needs just will why we are continuously talking about joy blissful he is not because its a goal its have these are not goals by it self only why when you are pleasant by your own you stop being in pursuit of happiness you are fine by your self you don't have to go any where to feel you don't have to do anything to feel sitting here your feeling very pleasant now you will look at plot the way it is haan do y you are anelist race pursuit of your happiness is a life something till your death bed you are pursing what it mean that means you are a failure if you perusing happiness when you were five i can understand but that was not the fact your five your sently happy by your own when your fifty you are pursing your happiness s is a fail story you sent it sir sir guruji suppose we say this to the common man who has a little house where did you meet a common man i am imagioning the every man and women think they are special believe me oh yes yes where did you meet a common man i am asking oh okay frazer even he said about the common person and the special person i know some teachers have always told us and why your parents always tell you that you know you special each under fast is unique i remember this one i am not sure that i heard it at your discuss or on dvd of huge we you said it was about you know people being special and are solve is thinking that god knows of us and you said something like do you know all the grass hoppers in your garden so of course all wasted no so you said something like so how does god know each one of you then and i was never stated because i will start somebody out there knows we we we got your number to you thought you were number one on his book is it will i have been told since i legislature your unique and got guess about you when somebody says your unique its an insult  no you said no top line so you are sir peeche ke different ways in this vast cosmos this solar system is just tomorrow morning if the whole solar system disappears when issues nobody will even notice it but not even on the account books of creation so small in this pick up his role plan it that is a super in that mumbai is a micro super spec in that you are a big man or woman actually hear his problem this is a very immense existential problem this is because we have lost respect the west four we are what we are i was psychological reality have become bigger than the course see that is a big problem its time you step up of your cinema and i am not talking about the hindi i am talking about the cinema that everybody is playing in their own minds see sen s see right now they darcan this whole hall because it works best that we this is the basic technology of a cinema if you do not drop on the scene i mi ho if you light it up and play up nice cinema are going to work you have to talk in it so i am saying a cinema of your mind because its a dark space every thought is in large playing out bigger than the cosmic space today everything in the cosmos is happening well but you have one nasty thought crawling in your that and it feels like a bad day isn't it yeah yeah that because your psychological these your petty creation has become larger than the creators creation you not prospective of life that it is the fundamental basis of all this confusion and if you see who you are the micro spect the few are you want a match in that god is made in your own image and he looks like you and whatever ok if if you were all we would definitely think god is a big buffalo okay so what is it really please tell us the please define it for us what is it that is going on this life this love all these emotions that we go through in in our lives all these thoughts that we create first what is going on is are all human possibility and every possibility becomes a problem for those who do not explore the possibility needs right thought is it meant as possibility and ant can not think like you he can work better than you he's more discipline he bet it meant better traffic rules than you these no traffic jam of their okay but he can not think like you that's this is a possibility but now this possibility has become a problem for ninety percent of the humanity now they are freaking because they can think and the thinking all the wrong things their thoughts have become nasty if they place and they would win joined the thought process because its become nasty its becoming a ailment isn't it people are suffering their thoughts and mentally cause they do not know how to keep in place nothing has been done towards it so what is a possibility always becomes problem if you do not explore it in a right so your thought and emotion has become a problem now love affair is a pro mom you are making all kinds of things out of it which are all coming from this missonderstanding not understanding this thought and emotion is generated by me i can generate it which ever way i want if nastiness is what you like you do it i don't care that's what you like you string it if you are suffering it you shouldn't be doing it i am not telling you be loving what is your choice plus internet and if i place an sears you enjoy to it what is my problem you want to drink poison what is my problem i m just telling this is poison this is this drink whatever you want but my choice don't drink unconsciously that's that is not befiting of a human being a human being means we are far more conscious than every other creature on this planet that's what it is or every creature it's but we can eat so our eating becomes so many things every creature has sexual they go on fulfill it which ever we we can do it so we become something something we are doing the same things but we are doing it please suddenly there is a magic about it not because sex is magic food is magic no because we can do it every basic act like eating and carpating becomes because we can do it if you leave that one thing if you exclude that one thing from your life that you are not conscious about the why you think they wa you feel the way you act the way you move your body if you are not conscious about it everything can turn everything can become nasty so it is this which sets you apart from every other creature so a dog is working and a c if you show it a biscuit it will like it stay if you do this if this is what you are that if somebody is nice you you will wake your whatever if somebody is not nice to you you will write them i am saying what where is in in you forget about civilization i am talking about where is the evolution is the sign of evolution i am asking thank you sir very left go through i have seen people copying answers in examination but never portico meston six twelve today many women in our modern society are staping out and having a career and i just like to know what do you think of this of women staping out being career people managing home as well being financially independent it is good say every woman should do what she wants to do as an individual person it should not be made into your trained in a society or the only right thing to do and the word because i think if if i went it intends to have two children and raise i think its a full and not think you should not go out on work if wishes to as an individual person she is free to do what she wants to do but having two children is not about reproduction your manufacturing the next generation of people how the world will be we'll we did time in by what kind of mothers you have today  you know i have seen many ladies coming to me and say and i ask what are you know oh i m just a house while i say why do you say your just a house wife you you don't seem to understand the significance of you know being able to nurse to or three new lives its not its not a not important job its a very important job career i want you to understand no right now because we have made the whole world into economics unfortunately women also getting as to as if how much money you earn is going to return in the value of your life no it is just procurement of things that you need money is just about that man was you ring women was checking about the more beautiful aspect of light now women also wants to pro surely there is such an economic need in the family fine she must do it but it is not a compulsive need it must not be set up as something better to do than doing something if she is saying so if if he place music or if she just allow chal raha hai na if you looks beautiful r c is lets dutifuly like a flower its good enough i am sing it is not necessary that only if you earn this much money she is her she is doing something available otherwise she is not if there is an economic needs you can do it but if he has a passion for doing it she can do it but let not such values we set up in the world because you are not evalving your regrets you are making survival more important than aesthetics of life ok sab guruji let me take you with this then let me take you to a world of six sense when the film's okay let's glasgow movies yes go when films you know through the sixty seventy there were lovely stories nice values due to form use they by the time i was the star in movies some of our hate come eight cas might help shocked the previous generation and they must have said what is all this when still with williams whose limits in first eight susceptible just society you want i say and then now today the complex in the film the kind of sense we see you know its its little closed a its eleven relationship i you know up there on screen for everybody to see and night club culture i mean it sometime it worries me that might use in a growing up now the is what they are seeing this is he is the kind of sounds that they are listening to the lyrics are about you know from janma janma to expiry date yes so this is the this is what they are watching this is what they think its k hill this is the this is the hap and happening staff i i just sat by the time you came the janma janma was over and no it was still there was in the middle somewhere they knew it was wonder first the lyrics bastil lovely but today it is munni badnaam ho gayi and its things we have really moved to touring gums and i am for getting at this moment not the lyrics but then it's it's its slow right now india has we came this population in the world right now so with such a young nation growing up on this this is the is what you see this what you hear i m just really concerned as to what they will turn out to be sure your parents were content to they hate patta ok so can i i m sure my parents very concerned when i was so every parent has this concern and every generation has this and that the next generation is going wrong always i understand but you are saying this sudden change if every generation likes to for one step beyond where the previous generation steps in on her on just everything just for the sec of doing something different or its natural they have grown up in one they take it to another line level yes next is not always next that's what you are saying next is not always next right yes its not high  its just just next if so this concern is always there but right now the change that is happening he is not the next it is a serious influence because in the last fifteen years the world's ability to communicate across cultures and bot is is so heavy and so nobody has ever been used to this kind of influence before okay na to before this level of influence on our young people never before possible no the generation as ever experience this kind of on slot from so many and the volume of infrences to pick so in terms of changes are happening not it is not it is simply somewhere and nobody knows where is because its too complex and two mixed nobody knows where it is including the young people is just a mix of things so this is because of a sudden on slot of information and communication which is not for seses whether its good or bad it is st that definitely this level of information when i say information its like when we were growing up i believe it was true for your generation also with never knew what is bored okay there was no such thing you just excited about everything that came our way but you see to date twelve you are all if you tell him what he okay you see there s board vikas they know the whole cost must there is they seen it on their phone screen not even on a computer screen on the phone screen they've seen entire they know everything things that you do not know they are no you have and then it s by m commission by the time their eighteen they have had five lava fares and gone in the western world its like that here also its beginning the happened ok so by the time the rating they have seen everything that you need to see with sorry mind emotion ok by the time the twenty five what what next what you will see this is not my wish but this is something that i see the way peoples minds there working in the way they are being laid with information i am not by any standard se pacimistic person but i am just saying this if this level of information continues and it will multiply many fort for the coming generations you should not miss in the next fifty two hundred years yeh fifty percent of the hymn in population chose to commit so he you should not be because that is what will happen to the mind somebody is clapping look this is popular no you will just flats the word that no i am sending like today something today this the more people commit suicide in this world than all the wars in murders and accidents manage to q so more people are on self help already then murders were moungers bad drivers everything put together more people are on self help and if this level of information on slot continues and him in mind i know the nature of mind absolutely because i know my i know how it works what it can handle what it can not do i know it clearly what human mind is that's the reason why i don't have to read peoples book books are listen to their entire thing you they say one sentence i know what their mind is because i know the structure of human mind and otherwise i won't be who i am so i am saying this if this level of information on slot continues at the same pace or at higher pace it is possible in the next few years this will definitely lead to wanting to terminate yourself because there will be nothing to live for there is no joy and excitement about you please watch your chal raha hai by the time they are twelve fifteen days is you look back at cane on life those of you who are over fifty years of age just look back at you are another line when you are twelve fifteen was there any room for you to get bored about anything simply you were excited about every thing isn't it  today you will see its almost a common feature quar fifteen year old kids chess board nothing is yes they are all on ipads iphones because we are talking about love and life this will not mean nothing because you had one affair when you were eighteen years they you thought this is your life and you want to willing to die for it whether you write for it or not but at least at that time you thought you will die for it ok today but on facebook they have twenty two love affairs going we just means nothing i m not saying they should have it or not have it all i m saying is this will lead to an overload on the mind and suddenly a human being will think why am i here you know that big experience question to be or not to be this not the intelligent question unfortunately people things so this is only because you have not been touch by life you are not a piece of life you are just a psychological case your full of thoughts and emotions you i have not touch life at all you think your thoughts and emotions at la no your thoughts and emotions in the drama that your creating in your mind it is your cinema you must be able to end it somewhere if you do not know how to put the end then its going on endless cinema you are going crazy life is happening here you know your work is not life your family is not life your career is not life your cinema is not life your thought is not la your emotion is no plan life is here everything else is to life now the frills of life have become larger than life itself life is entirely if you touch life within you then its an explosion in a fancy when such a thing never happens to you because you have information about the whole cosmos on your phone screen you will never be touch by life because too much information too much thought even emotion is drying up too much thought this is happened if you look at european philosophy in the last hundred hundred fifty as you will see if you read the stars you will want to come at brellent interval actually brilliant but but you will wonder where you live because intellect is like that if you wake up in the morning devoid of any searching any life experience within you don't think about your child's way do not think about the flowers in the garden words in this car hai nothing beautiful that ever you just think logical you have to get out of bed that's not a small feet you have to brush tea breakfast go to work it work it sleep you can tomorrow morning same thing next fifty years you have to do the same process every day if you look at it one hundred percent logical and lecture li you will have no reason to lift morning tomorrow morning its only if you touch by something certainly was living if you will not touch by anything then its not worth living what is what is so worth living about a human being we came with the morning searching through life everyday he things sleeping marvin what is the point there is no point and let you touch by some think some magic of life if it doesn't touch you either in the form of now or in the form of a flower or in the form of something with in you if something doesn't sparkle within you definitely there is a question whether i should live or not isn't it and we are taking emanity in that direction with this overload of information information is not knowing information is just garbage collection you just gather things which don't mean anything to you you look smart in tea party but you are not smart in with life okay if you smart with life you must be plus four if you really smart with life you must be joyful and your only smart in a tea party because you know when somebody is talking something you know the galaxy g twenty two what happens that every body haan haan they can also open the internet and the se thing you you think this guy visited the galaxy so such guruji then what is it ok so for all of our give us in clear simple simple center they do this and you will be at least on the way to be blissful or happy or aware or living in a nice conscious we if you if you just if everybody makes an little effort everybody take a little time for this piece of life okay not for your family not for your career not for something else something just for this piece of life give it the time because this is the most important piece of life in your life isn't it so no okay even if you are in love with somebody still this is the most important piece of life so pay some attention to the how does it happen why have you taken it for granted they believe me you are not going to be for an ever i will bless you with a long life but you are going to fall dead one day yes sir no yeah so do not take this for granted if you wake up in the morning tomorrow if you wake up in the morning no this is not my wish but i want you to know of all the people who go to bed tonight over a million people will not wake up tomorrow morning and tomorrow if you and me wake up tomorrow morning is it not a fantastic a million people did not wake up you work up hi is it not a great thing just look at the ceiling and my you are tell you still there i am mili and people did not get up in the morning and you woke up and for many many millions of people somebody who is dear to them did not wake up so just check those five six people around you they all work up wow it's a fantastic day you okay and everybody who matters to you around you woke he said not fantastic day six you run things so and a you don't say the things because the problem is just this you are living with an i d that you are in when i say you are in mortal you are not actually thinking you are immortal but you are not conscious of your moral if you are not conscious of your mortality somewhere you think your him auto something how many moments in a day or you can say that your mortal if you were conscious would you have time to would you have time to fight with somebody would you have time to do some rubbish with your life if your new home if you are conscious that you are mortal you would do nothing other than what is absolutely needed for you and everybody around you this one thing if you do if you just remind yourself you don't think this and negative things that is not a negative thing its the only thing which is added value to your life if you are here forever you would be unbearable hey here you went one way that everybody dies one day if you just become conscious of this one that always your conscious that i am mortal you don't have to think i will die today we don't intent we want to live as far as possible just you know one day i will die if you just conscious of this one thing you will naturally become you will not becomes rich by thinking about we will become and realistic hello senatory you will that talking to somebody you will start doing all kind of things are three people you know they have here from town and they talking you know so with your last date ten years se koi somebody was working on the street talk and you would know that he's lost but today you don't know when i got there headphone dwara they just lost it and they are talking we can not make out but if you are conscious that you are mortal every moment of your life spiritual process has begun for you so the one one of the main reasons wa of the fundamental reasons why that all these things have to be thought to you that she is repeatedly asking this question were you born special did you have normal birth or not he simply because most people have for gotten there they think there is more to them are not actually think there in they are not conscious their motor with every step with every breath if they were conscious of this you know how conciously they would leave the would become fantastic it is your mortality which makes you want to know what is the nature of your you really want to know where you came from where you will go only when it sinks into you all this drama up one day it will end but right now you think only others appear in a future column see you are only going to read it welcome and thus simply beautiful it's all that's needed if you want to know the value of life just know that its a brief happening let time that you spend here as life its a very relative experience if you are truly joyful next stated his horribly brief believe i feel like i was born day before yesterday see already how i have become okay yes but on a particular day if you are depressed or miserable its one day seems like an endless thing so only miserable people have a long life yes a jyful extra person life is on this brief if you live to be hundred its still very brief for what possibility a human being carriage for the insanity of what a human being is its too brief a life you give one hundred years two hundred years its still still do to brief because before you know whats happening before you explore a few dimension of life it will be over it will be over over okay only miserable people have a very long life they feel its very long satguru g here we have a few questions first question is from prabha sundara sundar sen where and how do we draw the line between loving unconditionally and becoming a dormate so we need to understand this its being right now bastard is now is generally a mutual benefit scheme you give me this i will give you that if you don't give me that i don't give you this this is not said but its done okay it's done i sent it its not said to human being have physical psychological emotional economic and various other kinds of needs to fulfil these things when you say i love you in of making this things ugly needs that we too ugly transactions that we have to do you give me this you give me that to bring some aesthetic beauty to this transaction we coated with a certain amount of sweetness of emotion which we call as love where the transactions happen most smoothly because once we are human somehow doing basic transactions in a basic way makes us feel ugly if you take food with both your hands and it it its we want two eight in similarly to fulfill our physical needs personal nahi sikhana ick needs we have arrangements where we can conduct this in a more aesthetic manner i am not saying its right or wrong this is the fact of five so this level of la i called this this is enough for to fulfill the domestic needs of one's you know for two people to live together the full for their needs to are you to raise them domestic level of love affair people can have but if people want to have a love affair which will bring them to an ultimate union then not many people are competent to do that not people not many people are ready to have that kind of a love affair where it will make to lives into one two becomes actually one in experience that will need something more most people are competent of using love to fulfill the domestic needs but to go beyond that they are not ready i when i say they are not ready either nine i talk about this person or that question so when one is ready and another is artery or one is making an effort and another vision have the effort then it feels like somebody is becoming a door mat that is what it is that it feels like they are being but our war one who is longing to become use love as a way of ultimate union should not be bothered about being dormate this and that in india we have a culture where by choice people name them selves as alex you know ramdas krishna das this that that that's what is they are only saying i am a slick i am a dormate i want to be a dormate they are not saying am i afraid i will à¤¬ used as a dormate they sing i want to be a dormate so this is a kind of love that they are wanting to use to use for ultimate union this is not for domestic so if you are looking for ultimate union then love is a different if you are looking for conducting of domestic affairs then you must manage dignity who gets what anybody is using more than what they should then if you don't give me that i don't give you this okay otherwise if you are looking for ultimate union you should not think of all this things that's a different affair that's not for not much social thing if you fall in love its you become warner about this  without becoming vulnerable there is no love you have to fall when you fall somebody may raise you personal body me walk over you he has but the thing is the experience of your life is beautiful because you fell not because they raised you not because you wa aapke over you because you could actually have the sense of a bend in u two four that was the beauty of your love of fact not what they gave you what they did to you this no the beauty was you sat alone and you think you really love this person so much you willing to die that was the most beautiful moment not the moment they gave you a big gift of the moment they gave you a diamond ring not for the moment they said this and that about you know you just sat here and you will in to die that was the moment not just a that you are willing to be the dust on their feet okay i am not saying you should be like that i am saying where love trains formed itself and your devotion if you fall in love its help you become where you but there are still some straits of sanity in love affairs that you can recover but if you become a devotee there is no sanity left and you can not recover so before you trade such a land you must see whether you are for it or not what are your goals first of all if your goal is to make a life a caution a very measured love affair is good but your your your thing is you want to dissolve into the process of la if you don't want to have a good life you are not planning to have a good laugh you just want to become explosion of life you don't care what you get and what you don't it then you become a devotee devotion means it should intention to dissolve in your objective so devotee is not expecting whether i will become a dormate or a crown on somebody had whatever i become as long as i can touch your feet or head or whatever its fine with me so the sir different state of i don't think some but he was looking for domestic level of love of that should even ask that question we have one question from the social media the facebook amit madan wants to know in this matrialistic as the real feeling of love is disappearing from our life most of the love we receive from others and express to others is how can we real first the real feeling of love in our own life and in others you get about this if you if you learn to be loving by your own nature not because of somebody else or something i know the question is coming from facebook the norms possibility you can even love those people who don't even exist so i am saying is it raymond is possibility so if you to just become not love somebody then you will know the nature of love if you love somebody its a fikal happening because no human being will happen hundred percent the way you want them a every human being on this planet is going to disappoint you believe me not because they will do something wrong because nobody can fulfill we look and realistic expectation you have a that is simply not possible have you been able to fulfill any bodies expectation i am asking you partial but never entirely isn't it so nobody else will be able to do it unless you are still such a hopeless romantic still waiting that ideal person is going to come from somewhere no believe who ever comes i want you to know the ideal people whom you worship when krishna was there his wife's complaint alright so there is no offer something sir please remember satguru ji this is where we open yes the platform its anybody has a question this is a moment yes my name is anand my question is about marriage divers no no they are two different things see today is many youngsters like many of them they don't want to marry and few of them who marry there are cases where they are getting so would you like to close and light on this situation so you need to understand the institution of marriage one thing is as so we said a little while ago its about bringing a sedentary to this simple basic needs that every human being has i will repeat mera physical nahi there are psychological needs that economic needs emotional needs social but i t f means to fulfill all this things we set up an institution called marriage the all this can be conducted in a sensible man otherwise if we did it on the streets like every other creature it would be ugly for us we will feel not good about it so to bring some sense of organisation some s the take some stability because man and women coming together naturally brought fresh life the nature of human life the nature of human of spring is such that because of the possibility that a human being carries it is compared to any other creature it is the most helpless life which needs maximum amount support you could leave a puppy on this seat as long as he gets food he grows up into a good dog no problem but not service station in being he doesn't need just physical support he needs variety of support and stay above or the sable situation whether there should be marriage in society you are not one will debate when they are eighteen because physical body is asking for freedom alright at that time everybody questions is marriage really need but why can't we just live which ever way you want but when you are three years of age you valued marriage stable marriage in men's sent it  not yours you parents   when you are three four if you say three four years of your one hundred percent for marriage again when you become forty five fifty you are hundred percent for marriage between eighteen and thirty five you are questioning the whole process the that i am not saying marriage is the thing but do you have a better alternative if you have a better alternative damn the marriage but you have not come up with a better alternative because a stable situation is a must for a child once you have a child its a twenty year project that is if they do well if they don't do well its a life long project so if you want to get into such project at least twenty years there must be a commitment to create a stable situation your wims and fancies which stay in your emotions will change if that is what it is don't get into such situations its not compulsory for everybody to get married its good young too you are saying people are thinking whether to get married and i m and it is not necessary for everybody but if you get into it and if you especially if you get into children you but understand its a minimum twenty year project whether you like it or you don't like it otherwise you shouldn't get into those projects you don't walk into your project it half way and walk away isn't they have their benefits and they have the problems its your choice but at least choose don't have to get married because everybody is getting married you don't have to talk about marriage and divorce in same breath as if they come together this is a completely american idea you think in the marriage and divorce together nobody thought of divorce in this country till recently isn't why should you ever talk about marriage and divorce in one breath its a crime its really a crime to think on those but if it so happens something truly went wrong between two people and they have two separate that will anyway inevitably happen you don't have to plan it at the time of wedding namaskar hum satguru ke namaskaram nahi mam you mentioned about survival and talked about aesthetics of life i would like i would request you to liberate on aesthetics of life and my second question is from my friend i don't know whether you will answer it or na but i just want to mention it over here because he requested me to do so her question is what is the purpose of this universe tell your friend i didn't make it thank you so why am i being blame for this things the only thing i have done is i have fit the nature of my life and by filling the nature of this line i know by inference every life has happen the same way not just every life the very cost masses happen the same way if you know the nature of this life from its origin to its ultimate you know the nature of everything by inference everything that's what knowing so tell your friend i didn't make this universe don't blame me for such big things i just figure my way through my life and when you figure it you figure it you will see the most important thing that's happening in your life right now that you know like nothing else not that stocks have gone up today that's not the most important thing not your lover phe not this in that if you don't understand what i am saying suppose tomorrow you lost i am not saying you must wish i am not wishing you must lose but suppose tomorrow you lost half your money and you are feeling and your mind says i want to that close your mouth hold your nose like this for two minutes your body says to hell with your money i want to lift tomorrow you found your love affair and your mind says i want to die  by within you says to hell with your love affair i want to live you every time you feel little suicidal depressed this check the life within you says to hell with all this things i want to let so i want to know the most important thing that's happening to you right now is life itself not the fancy thoughts that you have not the emotions that you have not financial arrangements or family arrangement whatever rubbish you have built around you these are all accessories to life these are all frills frills are so much you missing the skirt the the whole problem yes so much fundamental things you forgot so this is the most important thing right now hum most people life means their job that means the new house the building la it means the car that they bought life means the white their husband and children no life means what's we are not even you body not you mind not your thought not two what is right now driving here this is life because this is on every thing else seems to be meaningful if this one stop nothing around you means any damn thing to you or to anybody
