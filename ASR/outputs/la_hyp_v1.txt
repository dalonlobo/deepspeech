line is called so that which does not stop light is mt space so both space and time are referred to as call hai because they are not seen as two different and this only because there is time space is possible because that is you can move from point eight can be so there is price there was no time they it was no way to move the general perception is that because there is space there is time but i don't see that because there is time there is space now there is time which happens because of the plan expense once its a day the moon goes around the plan x the plan it goes around susan p we are today cycles of time or one dimension of time this is another dimension of time which is not which is do you on this syclical nahi chah this we call as a great time is called the maha ka lakh there is time and there is greater time even when there are no cycles cut where there is no syclical moment there is no physical happening everything that's physical and the universe from what is ethnic to what is everything is that like there are no cycles happening that is no physical possible when i said if you take a or if you take the centre few goal to ride away from the cycles of time means being in this context that we know the cycle shift time only because of phir se kal hi aa rahe the if we could if we could what is the speed of an electron around the proton or neutron we could keep time comic time too much for us to be major the planets how much time it takes to go around this i set it we went little further down today is in hours and minutes and seconds all of them or cycles of the physical access tax if there is no physical exist we would not know anything that if we did not know what is syclical moment we would not know the site little nature of achcha hai but before exist manifested in its physical nature there was time this is called maha kala hai that is and nated no space you are not watching my words i m saying and ten when there was no moment and everything was still there was star but nothing syclical happening that dimension of time into which everything resolved and from which everything one sun energy iii it ts took to sight little moment when fact lekar moment happened physical happened when physical happened we could measure time otherwise time bus just pace the word kala means both time and space such group we came for a party and here you are going at her like this  it is important to know or rather its important to touch an experience a garments which is not syclical in nature because what is start reco is in everyday billi what is that ligo in a veritable runs itself out its employed at some point it ran six of the anything that's saleko cannot be forever because it needs a amount of kinetic which is going to expand its half when i have in being third thursday dimension which is not syclical lene generally there is a new quality which is beyond all qualities  not bad but this not that  like this is nothing he nothing low about it its just that you have moved from the surface to the short not that its house all your problems its just that you won't know what is the problem this i said something in down india situation and this quote is making rounds even reach the prime and star and he was laughing i said for every solution there is a problem just see where every solution somebody has a problem people me thing for every problem there is a solution but when you don't see any problems when you see only some people have problem so the solutions i don't know whites app what will i do with which is and nothing at once woh achcha raha hai tu with my saaf which is me and you at once chalaya to the problem or is this suggestion where maybe a space where there are no problems and now just parsa hua hai woh parts are of nothing and props out into nothing what is the problem and what is the solution i am asking hello the you crupt up from nothing you want to pop out into nothing in this little space and time what is the problem and what is the solution i wanted to figure this out hello what is the problem haan there really no problem no solution actually but there are from many problem the good we don't know where you are living where i am living there are so many problems i am also living amount the kind of people that you are living with yes same sort the question is just what are you rooted in true if you are rooting is just your physical something so problems thanks for if you are rooted in your psychological framework everything is a problem if you are routed into the nothing is a problem nothing as a solution everything is an experience of line haan everything is an experience i i die tomorrow that is also very good experience we don't wish tomorrow but if it comes that is also an experience no  like it whether you like it or not it happens yes yes whether you like it or not it happens not that we are facing it tomorrow but if it happens tomorrow but they have we don't wanted tomorrow still got miles to go before i sleep miles to go karta ho raha hai iske we don't know how many months he will go but if you look at life in its full they have life is the amount if you look at life in a lanier fashion life is a set me me to time if you look at life from your psychological life is a number of problems everyday i making all sorts of thousand sakta hai how many per aayi thi sirf problems they have means for sure for every solution there is a problem that is the problem that is a problem in between series of problems serial inventors of problems one cycle is entering a new year is coming its a choice that you have to make are you going to invest your thought and am option and in making a problems for making or simply enjoying life for what it is the choice that one has to make but this is my resolution i won't make any more problems to make resolutionus first you need a constitution do you have a constitution hello you don't have a now like nation has a constitution religion has a constitution to one advantage with the constitution of the nation is we can mandate the constitution of the religion cannot be and that its fixed anything means violence will happen if you suggest an amendment they will ke liye that is their amendment the national constitution kaun statutes which it is open to debate and amendment i am asking you you as a person do you two have a on and you have what you like like what you don't in this what i will do what i have in the morning person i am a evening person i am a whatsapp person i m a e mail question mam facebook person there are constitution individual question have we not written down but its there is sent in if you can paas a resolution there must be your constitution there is no constitution how to paas resolution about it so there is once you have a constitution you are not a life you four and institution if you are living in an institution you know what it means it means your are not case yeah not everybody either you are a that case or your spiritual esparent yes you are a seeker obsenity or you are a seeker of liberation one of this things means you live in a what resolution should i take for the new year all resolutionus or impressions where there is no where there is no awareness to know life from the line of on the live nest it is you want to fix it if you press the solution today in some boy you are making sure that you will not be aware for the next one year because awareness means spontanious response to life moment to moment reveluation means fixed pre fixed if you pre fix your life whether its done by you or done by somebody house if if your government passes a resolution all of you must hang upside in india we would say a timer entry here basil we hang you from  what's the mystery from which they hang people no particular tree haan where to find a haan sir i to find a big oak tree to hang from difficult to fine them in india we see at timer entry for a particular reason so let's say you are gone and passes a resolution that all of you should hang upside down from a tree what about give you a choice of the train will you prefer this will you protect this will you to rebel against it or no haan the yes whether your government pus is the resolution or you paas the resolution its not any different you trying to save something back force anything that you try to do by force feels like you are hanging up sir want to be like this but you want to do this you will feel like you are hanging up when you hang upside down you will feel like rabling against it so naturally within three days your resolutionus will become resolutionus other wise you surfer hanging upside down where if you sentar hi hai some will dissolve this in three say some and three wa c sum in three months but the very fact that they need one more resolution by the year and is a proof that if not did not last the here so there is no need to take any is huge bats resolution is made because you want to do something that you naturally don't not incline towards same two thing is are you implying to be joyfully kya kya aayega that is only for are you naturally implant bhi jyful  the little ones aisa so you can can i cannot attempt to be jwy for is my natural inclination how social evil eye being in the coming just keep accounts haan will not of people who are doing business they think they are keeping accounts only for the sec of i r s  to keep accounts not for the cause if you do not keep accounts to you do not know whether you are making profit loss that's a idy of accounts whether you moving forward a backward to know this you need an account book that you keep an account book at the end of the day just check am i a little more joyful today then today  if you have done this since you were five you you would have been ecstatic by now profit side same like this because you never kept accounts one day you checked when it became very acute then you say you are in a big loss every day every month just keep accounts am i becoming more joyful they are only two things are those hula you and how much joy do you give the people around you this you can keep a the if you keep accounts of this people are keeping accounts of their money as if they are going to carry with them the real wealth of life is how jo issue were how wonderful is your experience of life joe is not a goal by itself but its a necessary m beans for life if you don't set this one and beyond then whatever you have is just going west haan you mai have helped that's going west because there are more people on this plan for healthy and miserable then on healthy and at less if you are atleast if you are unhealthy you got a good enough excuse for your charhi  your healthy and miserable there is no skills i wanted to just understand this is just not smart to be haan this happened a lady was driving and then she has a flat tire she has never really on this this changing tyre business but she read the instruction she put the jack and lifted up the car see and in the way we with great difficulty she pulled up the heavy well from the booth and was trying to fix its and these four notes that she had she has kept it in the hub cap and with high heels she was struggling and she steps on the hub cap and all the four not flow in different so she put the new trire but share no nuts  then she was cursing and wondering and what the hell to do now and sure looking because he was hearing all kind of noise from a mental shan which was across the street then on the third floor there was a young man looking out of the window what in this then he sir hai inline look all you need to do is take one one not out of the three weeks and put the three nuts on this you can drive to the gas station with three nuts you can drive no problem she did that and she got the card down on the road and she looked up but him and said your source mouth what are you here he said i am a v not but i am not to beat so i mai act will little but you don't have to be stop it all this so called smart people to become like their practicing a poster for their great when i look at people i think they and they are doing query proved they don't understand is it doesn't take practice when you die it happens yes  do you think you need to practice  because you can't improved depth with practice but you can improve life with practice yes sir no  however you do like can still do it better yes  but that happens super efficient for every party you can't improve up on that you think you can improve he you don't have to practise your final post right now it will come naturally believe me its not like life they are no difficult things that it come very naturally you will do perfectly well in the great you don't have to have any doubt he doesn't need any preparation when you die you will get it haan patna ho kuch life there is so much to do and more how much ever you do there is something more to do about like the sunday if you want to be as it a friend a mentor and beyond is that you tried for otherwise you will get this to immensely intelligent ediotic question to be or not to be its inter actually seems very profound but its the most radio to question you don't have to decide not to it will happen there were many idiots like you countless number of idiots like you on this planet they don't have to worry about to be or not to be now anyway they are not to be this is our time on this planet yes yes this is our time on this planet what are we going to do achcha kuch are we going to make this into next so if you under four planet are we going to make this into for able this is our time we are free to do either way sorry i won't tell you theek the resolution that you will make the saint your wonderful planet that is no such time the natural inclination of life is if you choose to be very pleasent within yourself plus and things will happen if you fill in for able within you and you try to do wonderful things mam i wanted to understand the worst tirants on the planet those who thought the bedy list historically i will pick up the worst of the lot you to take somebody like adele phela or benito must fully nahi de really believe they are going to create a wonderful world you know this they had a dream of an ideal world when you have horrible things going within you and you go or the world with very energetically what you will create is a horrendous reality before you touch the what if you want to clean some worries we your hands must be telling yes  your hands are not clean you try to take this its not gonna work so before you touch the upside world this much you must do to with your staff that you are and you are whatever your touch will become your unplegent but you have good intentions it is no good i want you to understand right now in the world one situation that is happening in paanch sau which almost everybody in the world this is the most horrible things that can happen they believe they are creating gods own kingdom just what now yes they one hundred percent believe you me question they went you cannot question their integrity cause there willing to die for it when a man is willing to die for something you cannot question is in territory sent you can question is intel is but you cannot question is because when i take my life you must know i mean it isn't it i am not playing full with it it means more to me than my life yes sir now sir i want you to know you have anger and its going with a new but you want to create a wonderful work what happens the count sequence of that he is a horrendous reality it's not intention that the world will change it is by your consciousness that the war will check how are you are within yourself if we don't fix this one thing we will have intention and intends the worst things have happened on the planet with good intentions two with bad intentions yes sir the most for and rust things have happened with very good intentions so what intention you have is not important what is your in our nature this is important every action that him and being are doing in their life no english or are knowingly in pursuit of their well being and you know you feel well only when you are hello yes you feel really well only when you are happy and or in other words a every single action that human beings perform he is in pursuit of their happiness joy if there were joyful by their own nature every action that you perform would become ins to being compulsive do this is all you have to do to your saaf this year be coming here and they are coming coming here and for the rest of you just have to keep accounts yesterday to today i am am i you don't even have to worry about giving joy you are joyful you will spread joined yes  will you keep accounts i am asking wa shall i said i r s do you need most societies have been run for a long time by enforcement so if those nobody to enforce hello that's not what happens is there is nobody to and force anything you become quiet for sent it i want it heard this and this the difference between a resolution and moving towards the natural inclination of line if there is nobody and forcing anything upon you do you become miserable lajo  so you don't have to enforce any resolutionus upon yourself this little tools to make sure that you don't think just keeping at delhi everyday before you go to bed to miss check whether you are little more jyful today then s today okay if you keep this up at the time your thirty you will be when i was when i was just twenty five  i simply said then with march closed every cell in my body was draping x this nahi hum le sex then i realize this is a nothing to be done if you don't know mess with your man your the fool that i was i made a plan in two and a half to three years time i am going to make the entire world because there is nothing to do if you simply said here you know thirty five years have not lost it a few people have yes quite a few people have got it but still main aap tak ko rok liking some estimates and on an average in the last three years time we should be touching nearly hundred million paco but still that's not the world no no don't don't don't enjoy my failure idea of the world is seven point three billion people  under million is not a success it looks like i am listain to die but i will die a blissful because maybe in blissful is not dependent upon the result of my actions  or rotate in marbles filled this this is how life needs to be conducted that your actions are rooted in your joyful nation blissful s that joy is not a result of something that you do the moment it is a result of something that you do it will fly away no time because our actions in the world not always are their success for a how ever will you do it  however well you do it not always this access our actions are subject to various many forces have to come together for the success of any action not always they will fall together so if you if you are well being is inslaved to the success of your activity than you being joy four is a very remote possible it takes and our what will happen is when you perform action is if they don't succeed you are going to become after a couple of then you will you will see how to rest tract your life to minimal activity so that you will enjoy maximum success if you cripple yourself you know if you cripple yourself you can participate in a race with people suppose you have only one like then you participate in a race with somebody who does not have both the legs on of course you went this is what most people are trying to do the moment there is fear of suffering a what you will do is cripple yourself respect your activity only when failure doesn't matter that you can go through your fail your you will do everything that you can do who cares whether it happens are not we will do it then we will do it well if it happens its great if it doesn't happen it's very great because we can do it all over again joy is not a consequent of flight or activity of joy is a natural ambience which is necessary if you have to tomorrow morning if you have to wake up and want to do something you you need to have some joy in your otherwise to be or not be will it come or not cause you wake up and tomorrow morning you dearest of nothing you will wonder why i am here so know what day one twenty four hours completely will you wonder what the hell am i doing here yes sir no a because this is the nature of flight f this life has to it needs the mb unsafe chor hain so we have given you the tools to live joyfully you mai skip accounts    guard it before the food and music is very and a party is very i don't want to take any more time if there is a question that you can't go into the new here with her being and city very such a question okay not that you must ask your question you raise such a question okay but it works only if you speak uska rasta karo a i have thousands of pointing questions but i thank you immensely for giving me this percent class one question haan how do i get traitor some unconscious bad habits and male life when i see that i have overcome some of those bad habits see that it comes back again in my life how do i just totally get rate of this and become free out of you must understand that there is no such thing as good habit and bad habit all have its a back have it means your you think only bad head with sir on kansas now a even the so called good habits hai every means you have learn to function in an automated way means you don't do things for example he is brushing your teeth in the morning a good have been too bad have it even you i thought you would be free from a habit there are two ways so pressing you theek because you have been resimented to brecier theek you get or because you wake you are very center there if you open your math you can see most of the time you are not contest in only other people know this is a very strange thing there is the the all factory which now which have a sense now alright he about your mouth but you don't get it others get it five three that means your unconscious yes  if you are conscious you would still brush teeth till you come to such a place when you open your mouth in the morning males like fragrance you become like a flower till it happens you must contest lee brass if you on different days or different morning it many different or different amount to not everyday brushing is saying requirement but because your minutes i am as where my teeth out if you are on a particular day he would brush as it is necessary for that day that's how it should be on a particular day you would it as it is necessary for the body you to sleep as it is necessary for the body you do everything but now it's a habit everything is a habit what time you should go to be what time you should wake up what you should do what you do not eat everything by prescription this is called your doctor tells you or your slave master tells you what you should do today i don't see what's the difference why is it that you do not know what this body needs today because no consciousness everything by by habit have it is resimented center its only barage maintain you become have been so in this you have also i didn't decide something as good a bit and something as bad habit what to do is there something called as bad and good and that's what you're saying when you say i have a good have it you are saying i am unconscious in a nice way its like sai saying i am dead in a nice because the fundamental difference between being alive and being there is being conscious and being totally and being partial in kansas is being partial did as i earlier told you you trying to practice the post and the state what it means to be that do not fix any kind of habit just say see the idea of with drawing into retreats coming to your presence space is just this to find space where you can do everything when you were in a race you could not be you got mad and you somehow fixed some have through which you manage to go through your daily office when you come to spiritual space this is what you were supposed to do that you want what is the requirement of your body what is the requirement of your mind what is the requirement of your what is the requirement of your what is this life need what was it naturally long for two conciously watch this once you conciously know that this is what it is longing for then there is no two ways about it otherwise you think you are in the spirit of that because me that's a crime against me its if you are unconscious is a crime against yourself but you are doing something that you think is because of me that's a crime against me the better do crime against few self not against me so how do i get rid of you don't have to get rid of habits it its like what you are asking is how do i get rid of my you used the word on we are suggesting and not exist not an existent confuse ness is when consciousness is not there that is called and consciousness how to get rid of something that does not exist i am saying u plying a tract with your its like s suppose this this hall is talk how to get rid of this take it out haan all of you today that i am sure you can kick up the dog you will get into and in same effort you in on it  this in some effort to get trade and consciousness no to get rid of dafney you just have to lighten up if you light it up defness is gone because document is not an existance by self e just absence of light similarly and confationus is not an existance of its f it is just absence of consciousness if you become do you have to fight with haan if you are conscious do you have two fried with unconscious habit the so you need to work on consciousness to become conscious what should i do you should not do one contest things because their sense of life is being conscious you know that you are alive only because your resinably contest sent it yes sir no  you are fast this step do you know you are dead or alive do you know sir  why because you are not when you are not you do not even know whether you did or alive it sent it now you know that you are alive because your son what now we just have to praise the way a little bit to become more conscious that's what we are working on there are many things which has gather in russia your physical body that's why the five thirty from in the morning your mind has got into is shown habitual patterns that's why i am torturing you with all this your energies have followed the requirement of body in mind and they have got me into their own patterns that is why the the idea is to break the cycles of and consciousness and become conscious when you become looks like you are in unknown terrain suddenly everything seems to be difficult when you are going have visually it look like everything was easy but see when i when i went into the quire metro operation yeah i mean there when i went there to conduct the program must twenty five twenty four twenty five years ago i just took this is something a whole or people are seeking in their line present line because this is the place where somebody always opened the doors for and then close it five they turn off the lights for you they do everything for you don't have to do anything really food comes off bang on time always by the second i am telling you khan means food is ready i have i think its great and this person i thought stegnate place o only thing is it and forced but this is what a whole lot of people are seeking sister in the line s  when it is done to you you will say for it i am telling you when is when it is done to you you will separate actually for a whole lot of people present line is for more it is far more organized and what they dream of in their line its for more efficient for more and most of them are very fit and healthy but if you enter the there is suffering in the air not once i have been there hundreds of times the various presence not once have i step out of the present without he is in my eyes because there is suffering in the in the air is unbearable because one thing that the hymn and being surfers most he is lack of freedom not lack of comfort not like a wealth not like of this in that once freed mistake on away i human being s offers in everything is correct prison life is far more comfortable then going to work and coming back getting stuck in the traffic going through all this problems you are state guest you know really if you are looking for a no surprise is kind of like if you save every little thing everything shops you wa everything makes you go through stress and tension person life is perfect aim the thing is in order no for everything is just right in the menu is written next seven days what's the menu its there and it goes by that nothing more nothing more nothing less one bean more means somebody will be taken to task everything is correct those who were looking for a correct life prison is the best place that i him in being will suffer immensely when everything is correct yes sir no a everything is correct but no freedom people will suffer this immensely so you need to understand have bit means you have cost little prison of your own and you will say for this have to sometime initially looks like efficiency after some time it is cursion is in many ways and happy home of efficiency is that but efficiency is not what this life is looking for this life is looking for expansion this life wants the freedom to expand all wise i was talking to one of this management specialist from my so where a well known man they not mention the name so he will providing all his management principle which of which look like a presence help to main bringing order to everything so but sufficient see there are two ways of looking at this there is a manicure garden which looks very perfect r is forest which looks like yours but the many cute guard if you don't manage it for one month its finished there is no garden left forrest has managed itself for a mill in years and still going on which is more efficient which is more  forrest is far more arderly and for more efficient that it is not fitting into your logical framework thats all this is what enlightenment mix that from being a manager you become a forest because its stands upon its it doesn't need anything from outside nobody need to water it nobody need to man all right nobody you need to come and everything happens within its half  the if you leave it for a million years it is still be there only if you medal with it s me go otherwise it will sustain its half because it is an efficiency of cross we call something cures not because it is an efficient we call something cares because it doesn't fit into our logical framework so have it means you have become a slave of your own logic and after some time the moment you form have it it is unconscious so what you need to get rid of is not you have to become conscious if you become more conscious and you are not then there is no such thing as have it you will do whats right for you now so nine hundred ninety nine questions please live with that for twenty seventeen all the best thank you so much for this after i have one regarding the work and i wanted to know like if we read the work is the bride and i am doing the practice said the practice is in the work how do they help versus the programs that we have when if someone reading the work into in the fact is there exactly now what is it that they need to do next  what i do to this okay person hai ok three thank you no no is it is a bit too early for flowers thank you i can be systems ko in air oh i m a spare them on the opening i usually i achcha it very much thank you very much  haan dekha hoon sorry factory se haar  microphone please its a point that i want to i hand its like stinking this nest this in a white sheet my head is like in part for three this past stamp except field my head is my true being works that have worsened the housing see her squiring around these pieces by vascalay nahi hai pet me tej stock in time ka malodic rock se kya usen ki kaam karen and t track says one hundred marketing goals than seven a great ambition so preferred is this is the price he am i mamla wisconsin for i am sorry kyun na we watched the way by we lost the question okay okay okay practice is all i said if i get this the but that would be amazing sorry that was lovely package getting haan ok mein denge par that case getting to the view was the main thing you know so its ok but you don't have a sweet form like when you said the book you know i m supposed to finish this book before third of january i am working on that book when you said the book i was just thinking book book book because the book is bagram for last two days i am suppose to completed by third january we riding up book karna aati hogi i am to give it to the publisher by third and so that's a book mind you are talking about the old book old books okay theek practice that is taught in the inner engineering program needs twenty one minutes you need to sit in one place and do it it is of a different nature it is it is a process which can change to start with the chemistry of your system many of you have experience this after a few months to practice if you look back and see all those little little things which were so significant don't seem to bother you and m but this just go simple because the chemistry has changed you know what chemistry changes things change in whatever where you have known it but there are other dimension to human chemistry that instead of being a volatile reactive chemistry and become a very safe content chemistry which is pleasant and on practices in the book are not sitting down i m doing practices you could be doing it anywhere could be driving you could be working in office you can working on the street and tell me doing it there of the nature the other words the practices in the book or just to bring a set in amount of the book did not have these practices to start with but when i travel around in a make a but he was talking about being mind for then i saw are being mind for what they will do to them my entire work is to bring you to some sense of a that you can be here like you are not here if you you don't even know whether you have got if you sit like this first thing is you don't have a gender you do to win our body so where is the na of if you same place it like this there is no time for you look only because you have a body you bought is keeping time yeah likes telling you how long you

bathroom break two bedroom like it is keeping time from wake up to sleep it is keeping time  once its time we will do you don't have to look at the watch once the seran time is up bade kaise right now new seen that old time machines which sand trickling away like that the bladder is keeping time drop drop drop as it fills have you no what's the time like sir keep in that time if you are done your practices regularly i mean the program practices not the book practices if you done the program practices regularly your legs can receive time you next dont know whats the time your likes  book book practice so the program practices or of a different that cannot be transmitted unless certain mental preparation and its a transmission is not theek hai book is a teaching tell big difference between teaching and transmission do not misunderstand both as one this is a way of creating a smaller steps for people but people are not willing to take one big step one small step they read the book and if some small things change them take the program but there is no substitute for sitting properly with post and doing what is being done properly and not only that there is no substitute for transmission if something is not transmitted something new will happen improvement of the present will happen nothing new will happen which shambavi we r not looking at improving you we want something new to sprout in here something that was never there with you till that moment must happen within you that saint and the book is trying to decorate the existing when ever you are right now to make a little improvement most people are looking for improvement and life they are not looking for transformation means nothing of the old should remain that's but most people cling to the will you leave twenty se stay in or will you carry with you haan can you do it leaves you you will not leave it two sixteen will leave you but you will not leave twenty sixteen isn't it  course you are a creature of memories if you are a creature you are a creature of the past haan that means you are a diner which is extent you become back because of your memories isn't it but your  what is the use i know i was a big rich but doesn't exist what is the use i am asking at this if you live in your memory you are break but what is the use what is needed is to reverberate with what is there now money is good to handle the world is good only to handle the world its no good to handle this one isn't it to understand what i am saying mam ri is good to handle the world around us we need to remember what happened what happened with this person what hai but with that person what happened with that person what happened with that situation and this situation we need to remember it is useful to address the world but with your silly me meri you are not address this one it doesn't mean anything this one you can address only with kansas match there is no other way to us you won't have this one you have assembly of things see let me address something very sensitive i want you to listen to this carefully otherwise you will come to wrong conclusion let's is somebody very dear to you or they go away for some reason you feel like you lost everything yes or no you feel like you lost everything because you are making up a life of sab where you are not there you filled it up with other people when they go away there is but that's not how life is happening because you are that only because you are there you can have relationships with people is sent in hello  now in your experience you are not there because your creature of memory you they only remember this one and that one and that one you can't remember this one how can you remember this one because this is the current line you cannot remember this one because you are handling everything by memory you will when one volume of memory which was a certain person or a situation if that goes away it feels like life has come to an end simply because a certain amount of investment you have made in a city amount of memory you have about a specific person so if you leave by i am saying twenty sixteen will leave you but you will not leave twenty sixteen if don't leave and twenty sixteen how do you go to twenty seventeen you can not you drag all these years and go into twenty seventeen there is no such thing you will be on a trade now at the exercise but you won't go anywhere trade trade mail is fine the weather is bad but its not a vehicle to go somewhere and this much you must understand memory is it said male yes mam main reception mein hoon it is alright to handle situations around the but you are not going to go anywhere with it human being have invested so much in their memory there is hardly a hand for who will go with me on this one the i am asking how many of you really want to step in to twenty seventeen fully leaving twenty sixteen behind ya woh ho gaya few really is really really if you can leave the past as pest completely if you can sit here just in the present no your and like you know that's all it takes its the burden of the past which doesn't let you flower and your full possible it just the burden of the past so this is a good moment this is not something that the plan it is doing ok yeah its the salt spices just happened it is there its every day plan it is spending every day it is moving in the trajectory of the planetary moment around sound you can choose any point to get you don't have to wait for this point yes sir no anyway we are at this point where somewhere in your mind you have been told it is significant its only significant because there is a nanri of twenty sixty if there is no memory of twenty sixteen in what way there is a twenty seventeen there is no such thing sarah this wrist karo you confusing sixteen sixteen seventy its aesthetically correct yeah  but only because there is memory they sixteen and there is seventy so so if you know how to simply sit here without
