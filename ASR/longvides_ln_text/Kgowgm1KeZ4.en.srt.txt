 good evening everyone
 good evening everyone
 nobody is saying anything 
  no they are all here but they are very silent
they are all waiting for it all to begin
and let me tell you i have to confess
as i came on 
before this i was quite relaxed 
but as ive come on to the stage my heart is beating really fast
so  while guruji was praying
i was saying to myself i must be relaxed this is the time
when i am with my guru i must be relaxed that this is it
so yes i will calmly begin by thanking you sadhguruji
for giving me this opportunity to be in conversation with you
isha foundation thank you very much
 i i thought when we are talking about of love and life
heart beating is a good thing 
  okay yes its a good thing
it shows im alive and in love and about to begin this conversation
and sadhguruji i want to say
i have attended your inner engineering program
i have seen some dvds
i have read your books
and everywhere there are your brilliant views on various issues
it could be from the making of a nation
to the making of a toy car
from the running of a household to the running of parliament
you have brilliant views on every issue that one can ever question
yet i know very little about you
and it
you know heres a brilliant mind with an for lack of better words
i would say outofthebox thinking 
so different
so refreshing
so enlightening
i am fascinated and i want to know about your life
and id like to know that
i mean
were you just born brilliant
did it begin from that very moment
 i was a normal birth
i didnt come in a box 
my mother had a normal child
 no you know
im from the movies and i cant help thinking 
was it like it is in story books
that a venerable sage came to your home
and when he looked at your mother
he said 
there is going to be born a guru rejoice
he will lighten his own path and that of others
 you also you also going like this 
 no but was it like that or how was it
how was your childhood
 i dont think they all came to listen to my mothers labor pains 
 no im really fascinated
intrigued that were all here
but you know the way you think
we wait to hear what you have to say
weve all been little children
and weve all grown up
but weve grown up and been educated in schools and
but i find our way of thinking
our way of being very conditioned
like almost systematized
whereas
so where where did it all begin
 i think youre looking for something unnatural that happened there 
one thing that could be considered unnatural was
it seems i was a very delayed birth
my mother went to the hospital three times and came back
and she gave up that hes not coming 
and when it actually happened it happened at home
my father being a physician that was not possible
she she had to be in the hospital
three times she went and three times it didnt happen
they did everything possible and she gave up
so it happened at home
so thats the only reasonably unnatural thing
everything else was natural  birth
i didnt come in a box 
and i refused to be educated 
so what is
i mean the question that youre asking is
do people grow up and blossom
or are they brought up by somebody
you will see the general expression is
i was brought up in this place
i was brought up in that way
especially in the west you will see
i was brought up christian
i was brought up jewish
these are very common words
i think its absolutely ridiculous and humiliating
that a human being has to be brought up
you bring up cattle okay
you dont bring up a human being
a human being is supposed to blossom by his own nature
that is why hes on the top of the pile
at least on this planet in the evolutionary scale
and most human beings dont seem to understand that
or they are not allowed to understand that by a whole lot of people
and they need to be brought up
bringing up means somebody is molding you
molding means its a predetermined shape
and no flower that blossoms is the same way as another one
which blossomed yesterday
but a mold means its always going to be the same
if you make a mold
the idea of making a mold is that we want to have the same form
again and again and again
right now generally that seems to be the work
unfortunately of the current education system
the socalled religions that are operating in the world
and of course the family
they want you to be in a certain mold
they dont want you to blossom like a wild flower
because theyre afraid of anything fresh happening among them
they want something that is familiar
they dont want something unfamiliar to be born among them
so if you have succumbed to that system
then yes youve been molded into a certain form
if you allow your humanity to blossom
then you will see you dont belong to any mold
this is the beauty of being human that there is no a particular way to be
if you were a dog you would be one way
if you were cattle you would be one way
if you were a sheep you would be another way
if youre bird  another way a grasshopper  another way
but to be human means there is no particular way
what is human is not defined nor described
it is it is just that
for every other creature on this planet
nature drew two lines
within that they have to play their game
for a human being only the bottom line is drawn
there is no top line
but socially people are trying to draw a top line for themselves
but nature has not drawn a top line for you
its a limitless possibility
and this is what is freaking human beings right now
because they cant decide what they can  need to be
theyre trying to be like somebody else
only bottom line is set top line has been removed
this is evolution
 but wait we still didnt quite get to
so how was it when you were a child
were you were you put into a school to go the systematic way
and did you keep up with it
 do i do i look that edu educated
dont insult me like that 
actually you know when i go and stand in the line
in the immigration lines in particularly in america
they look at me and say can you speak english
i say  
because i have that uneducated look its not easy 
do you know
do you know what it takes to remain uneducated
education is just twenty years of going somewhere and getting one certificate
to remain uneducated its very difficult
because from the day youre born
your parents every other adult the school the damn thing
everybody is trying to educate you
 yes
 about something thats not worked in their life 
 and then did you also like we all went through these confused teenage years
of not really knowing where were going
i mean did you clearly know your path
 not at all
i was right from three or four years of age
i was always a million questions hanging in in my head
i have a question about everything 
everything to everything
questions means very fundamental questions about existence itself
my own existence
so when i was three four years of age
suddenly i realized i know nothing
know nothing means 
somebody gives me a glass of water i do not know what is water
i know how to use it i know if i drink it
it will quench my thirst and so many other ways of using it
but i do not know what is water
im saying even today you do not know what is water
its the only thing available in all three states on the planet
three two thirds of the planet is water
two thirds of your body is water
if we think life we think water
but do you know what it is
with all the scientific exploration
we do not even know a single atom in its entirety
today our idea of science is
learning how to use everything
yes
we know how to use an atom
we know how to break it
we know how to fuse it
but we really do not know what it is
any one thing tiniest thing in the creation
we do not know in its entirety
this is the fact of life
 well even something simple as what you started with
saying that looking at water
i mean straight away i was taught water  h2o
and what it can do and it
you can mix it with colors and it becomes that
you can drink it and it quenches your thirst
but i never looked at it and said you know
i dont really know what is water
 because nobody looks at anything
see everybody is looking like this
nobody has any attention for a piece of life here
theyre like this 
if you pay attention to one life
one blade of grass
one grasshopper
one human being
something else will happen
thats why we said life and love
because if you pay attention to one human being
some love will happen within you okay
if you miss life at least some emotion in that direction must happen to you
that will happen only if you pay attention to one
if youre looking at like this 
these days its become a fashion because youre in love on facebook
you love the whole humanity
to love one human being
if you want to love one human being it costs life
to love the whole humanity it doesnt cost anything
its even better to love god
because its always easy to love somebody who is not here now 
its so easy
but if you have to love somebody who is sitting next to you right now
it costs life
you know how difficult it is to love someone who is next to you right now
how easy it is to love someone who is dead or who is in heaven
isnt it so
lets face it
because if you have to love one
one thing is you have to pay attention
without attention it will not happen
and above all you have to give up something that is you
to accommodate another
otherwise it will not happen
the english expression its very good 
you must fall in love
you cannot rise in love
you cannot stand in love
you cannot fly in love
you have to fall
something of you should fall otherwise it will not work
you will not know it
so you want to have a fake sense of life
then you dont pay attention to anything
everything is information
nothing is a living experience
everything is from the textbook or from the cinema or from the internet
nothing is from lifes experience
youre doing more and more today of that
 sadhguruji you just mentioned love
and today it is about life and love and i would like to know
for us it is maybe love your family members
whoever it could be i i
why i ask you this is because therere so many versions of this
and i really want to get to it
some teachers
some gurus
some guides will say you know
you can love but you must be detached
 ohoho 
 you must love but it cannot be conditional
it should be unconditional and
so theres versions of it
i just want to know
so have you
 see the simple the simple way of make you keep coming back to me is
to give you something that you cannot do
to give you a teaching which you can never do
you must love but you must be detached 
now you have to keep coming back to me for consultation 
endlessly
  sorry
 im saying throw yourself into your love affair and die into it
something will happen
something worthwhile will happen if youre willing to die into the process
not just anything 
whether its your work or your life or your love or whatever
if you do not know how to throw your entire self into it
you will never know the taste of what it is
love but be detached
what why do you want to love then 
only because you want to include somebody as a part of your life
part of yourself thats why you love
no i love but i im detached
this means you have to come back to consultation every day
it is like a psychiatrists job
everyday you have to come and sit on the couch
you need treatment and there is a fee 
 so okay all right
so you can love and be attached
 no no i didnt say that 
 okay im coming back for consultation please 
so what did you say
 i only said
see what is this need for love in a human being
you must understand
a human being constantly
constantly
a human being is longing to be something more than what they are right now
if this finds a simple basic physical expression
we call this sexuality
sexuality means just this
physically youre trying to make something which is not you a part of yourself
for a few moments you may succeed
if you try this mentally it gets labeled as greed
conquest or maybe simply shopping
shopping shopping
 oh
 some people go for conquest with swords and guns
some people go with cheque books and cash you know credit cards
the thing is you want to include something which is not a part of you as yourself
that is the whole effort tch
whether you want money or wealth or you want to occupy a nation
what is it
something that is not you you want to make it yours
yours is an effort to make it a part of yourself
if it happens emotionally on the emotional level if you try this
we call this a love affair
youre trying to make somebody who is not a part of you
a part of yourself emotionally
this is a love affair
if you do it consciously we call this yoga
yoga means union
so all these efforts are fine
everything has its own beauty but has its own limitations
when you understand the limitations of all the other methods
nothing right or wrong about it
it is just that it will work briefly
it will not work for always
when you realize that you consciously try to include
when you consciously become an inclusive process
if you sit here
if you experience everything as yourself then we say you are a yogi okay
so this is a love affair successful
 so something you said at the end
which i would like to ask you again
you said love inclusiveness
i cant understand how i can love everybody in this room
 you cannot
there are some people you cannot love 
 i can barely see up there and up there
so how is tha how do you include everybody in your love
 see because youre looking at love as something that comes to you
or you yield to the process of love
only because you appreciate a particular quality
a shape of somebodys nose or the shape of their mind
or their thought or their emotion or the way they speak
or the way they do things or the way they relate to you
something okay
therere many many things
it is based on something that is acceptable to you
if they do something that is not acceptable to you
love crumbles
  yes
 now what im saying is
i want you to look at this 
whether love happens to you or hate happens to you
anger happens to you misery happens to you joy happens to you
it only happens within you isnt it
 yes
 it never people say love is in the air
no
because you are feeling very pleasant in your emotions
suddenly air feels vibrant
it always been you missed it all your life
now youre beginning to feel it
  okay okay
 all right so whatever human experience 
love or hate whatever whatever 
happens only within you
what i am saying is at least what happens within you must happen by your choice
consciously you must be able to make it happen
if youre able to
if your experience or what is happening within you is happening by choice
what is the problem
it only happens within you
love is not a relationship
a relationship is a different thing
love is a certain sweetness of your emotion
whether you look at a tree or a dog or a man or a woman or a child or just at the sky
why cant you look at it lovingly
because its not about loving the sky
its about the sweetness of your emotion
if your emotions are sweet
whatever you look at you will look at it in a certain way
right now you have nasty emotions whatever you look at
you look at it in a different way
so you have always associated love with somebody
no no no this is not about somebody
love is not something that you do
it is something that you can become
if youre willing you can become love
you can make your emotion into a very sweet space
if you make your mind
if you make your body very pleasant it becomes pleasure
if you sit here it can be great pleasure just sitting here and breathing
if your mind becomes pleasant we say this is joy
if your emotions become pleasant we say this is love
if your very life energies become pleasant we say this is blissfulness this is ecstasy
if your surroundings become pleasant we call that success
now youre calling your success with somebody as love thats a mistake
you have a success story with somebody  that is
you have created pleasantness in the atmosphere between you and lets say fiveten people around you
youre calling that love
no that is actually success because that needs lots of management
 yes it does
 yes or no
 yes it does
 yes but for you to be loving there is no management
if you just make your emotions sweet
your emotions are sweet and its beautiful be be like this
its not about anybody
if somebody comes we can share it
if nobody comes you can sit here with eyes closed and still be loving
whats the problem
it is not about somebody its not an action
it is not something that you do
it is something that you can become 
 its a its a lovely idyllic
 it is not idyllic it is it is the way it is
 it is i mean youd really have to practice this
 why
 because im thinking
 see this is what exactly im saying
if it is an action
an action comes to perfection with practice only if its an action
im saying love is not an act
is health an act
are you acting healthy right now
 no
 i know youre an actor but are you acting healthy
  no
 so health is because
 yes
 you have done certain things and health is isnt it
 oh weve not done certain things
 oh we have definite
 weve been given
 no no no no oh weve been given but if you eat bad
if you live bad you wont be healthy
 hmm
 weve done certain things to manage our health
similarly if you do certain things
you can manage the pleasantness of your mind
if you do certain other things you can manage the pleasantness of your emotion
if you do certain other things you can manage the pleasantness of your very life energies
this is things that you can do
now what you can do internally youre trying to manage externally
what can be done here within you
you are trying to manage by creating an atmosphere around you
which is a very difficult thing to do
because outside will never happen hundred percent the way you want it
to some extent we can manage
we cant do all of it by ourselves
because there are many forces involved
 sadhguruji you said something about health
and you said you do certain things for yourself certain things
one  youre given health and then how you maintain it is you eat well
you exercise and you remain healthy
now to be loving when maybe in a household
any situation
maybe outside like you said outside forces are not pleasant
it doesnt come easily to then just be loving
so what is the practice to become that way
or to train yourself to be that way
 i i want to remove this idea from your mind
you believe you need to practice
practice means youre trying to perfet
perfect an action isnt it
 to be loving at all times
 yes yes thats not an act
 no not an act but to be so accepting
 no i dont want to
i dont want to go back to the movies okay 
 no to be so accepting because
 no its not about accepting
right now do you want to keep your mind
your thought process pleasant or nasty
tell me what is your choice
 ideally pleasant
 just tell me pleasant or nasty
youre thinking about it this is
 no i am trying to think
should i fox you and say nasty 
  say it
  okay nasty
 im going to bless you now 
 no no no
okay i take back my words 
okay all right so
 any human beings choice for themselves is definitely pleasantness isn't it
 yes
 body mind emotion everything and surroundings
you want it pleasant
 yes
 so why is it not pleasant
surroundings are not pleasant because of many things
 yes
 if your thought and emotion are not pleasant
its entirely you isnt it
 yes
 surroundings  not entirely me its so many forces
we have to manage them
we have to juggle them
not always are we successful with everything around us
you know different people have different levels of competence to manage the outside
not all of us have the same what to say
the skill to manage the outside
but inside your emotion and your thought
why is it not happening your way
this is something we have to look at
this has to be addressed
every human being has to address this
at least your thought and your emotion must happen the way you want it
on a certain day a lady went to sleep
a lady went to sleep
in her sleep  she had a dream
i think up there  
oh there are two strata of people nobody is asleep right 
so that i could pick on you im just looking if i can see
she went to sleep up there 
and in her dream she had a dream
in her dream she saw a hunk of a man standing in that corner
and then he started coming closer and closer and closer
he came so close she could even feel his breath
she trembled not in fear and then she asked
what will you do to me
the man said well lady its your dream 
 okay
 im saying whats happening in your mind is your bloody dream
now the problem with life is 
not that life is not happening the way you want it
even your dream is not happening the way you want it
thats the problem 
im saying at least fix this
at least let the dream happen the way you want it
if you were dreaming the way you want right now
your thought and your emotion would be pleasant isnt it
 yes but it well
 fixing the world is another thing thats a different game
that needs lot of skill
this needs just willingness
why were continuously talking about joy blissfulness love
is not because its a goal by itself
these are not goals by itself
only by when you are pleasant by your own nature
you stop being in pursuit of happiness
you are fine by yourself
you dont have to go anywhere to feel pleasant
you dont have to do anything to feel pleasant
sitting here youre feeling very pleasant
now you will look at life the way it is
otherwise youre an endless race
pursuit of your happiness is a lifelong thing
till your deathbed youre pursuing
what does it mean
if youre pursuing happiness when you are five i can understand
but that was not the fact
when youre five you were simply happy by your own nature
when youre fifty youre pursuing your happiness
this is a failed story isnt it
 but sadhguruji suppose we say this to the common man
who has a little house
 where did you meet a common man
 im imagining it
 every man or woman think theyre special believe me
 oh yes
 yes so where did you meet a common man im asking 
 okay sadhguruji when you said about the common person and the special person
i know some teachers have always told us
and why your own parents always tell you that you know 
you are special
each one of us is unique
and i remember this part
i am not sure whether i heard it at your discourse or on a dvd of yours
where you said it was about you know people being special
and us always thinking that god knows of us
and you said something like
do you know all the grasshoppers in your garden
so of course all of us have said no
so you said something like
so how does god know each one of you then
and i was devastated because i always thought
somebody up there knows me cares about me and im special
 you thought you thought youre number
you thought you were number one on his books is it
 well ive been told since i was kid
youre special youre unique and god cares about you
 let me tell tch tch tch see if when somebody says youre unique
its an insult  you know
 no you said  no top line so youre
 okay
 peaking in different ways
 in this vast cosmos this solar system is just a speck
tomorrow morning if the whole solar system disappears vanishes evaporates
nobody will even notice it
maybe its not even in the accounts books of creation
its so small
in this speck of a solar system
planet earth is a super speck
in that mumbai is a micro super speck
in that you are a big man or a woman 
this is a huge problem
this is a very immense existential problem you know 
this is because we have lost perspective as to who we are what we are
our psychological realities have become bigger than the cosmo than the cosmic reality
that is the big problem
its time you step out of your cinema
im im not talking about the hindi cinema
im talking about the cinema that everybody is playing in their own minds
see see right now they darkened this whole hall
because it works best that way
this is the basic technology of a cinema
if you do not darken the cinema hall
if you light it up and play a nice cinema its not going to work
you have to darken it
so im saying a cinema of your mind because its a dark space
every thought is enlarged
playing out bigger than the cosmic space
today everything in the cosmos is happening perfectly well
but you have one nasty thought crawling in your head
and it feels like a bad day isnt it
 yes yes
 so thats because your psychological realities
your petty creation has become larger than the creators creation
you lost perspective of life
that is the fundamental basis of all this confusion and suffering
if you see who you are
the micro speck that you are
you wouldnt imagine that god is made in your own image
and he looks like you and whatever
okay if if we were all buffalos
we would definitely think god is a big buffalo 
 okay okay so what is it really
please tell us the please define it for us
what is it
what is going on  this life this love
all these emotions that we go through in our lives
all these thoughts that we create for ourselves
what is going on
 see these are all human possibilities and capabilities
every possibility becomes a problem
for those who do not explore the possibility in its right perspective
thought is a tremendous possibility
an ant cannot think like you
he can work better than you
hes more disciplined
he betters main better traffic rules than you
theres no traffic jam out there 
okay but he cannot think like you
 yes
 that sets up apart
this is a possibility
but now this possibility has become a problem for ninety percent of the humanity
now theyre freaking because they can think
and theyre thinking all the wrong things
their thoughts have become nasty
if they were pleasant they would have enjoyed their thought process
because its become nasty its becoming a ailment isnt it
people are suffering their thoughts immensely
because they do not know how to keep it pleasant
nothing has been done towards it
so what is a possibility always becomes a problem
if you do not explore it in the right perspective
so your thought and emotion has become a problem
now love affair is a problem
youre making all kinds of things out of it
which are all coming from this misunderstanding
not understanding this thought and emotion is generated by me
i can generate it whichever way i want
if nastiness is what you like you do it
i dont care if thats what you like
but youre suffering it
if youre suffering it you shouldnt be doing it
i am not telling you be loving
what is your choice 
pleasantness or unpleasantness
if unpleasantness is your choice you enjoy it and do it
whats my problem
you want to drink poison what is my problem
i am just telling you this is poison this is this 
drink whatever you want but by choice
dont drink unconsciously thats stupid
thats not befitting of a human being
a human being means we are far more conscious than every other creature on this planet 
thats what sets us apart
every creature eats but we can eat consciously
so our eating becomes so many things
every creature has sexual drives
they go and fulfill it whichever way
we can do it consciously
so we become something something
were doing the same things but were doing it consciously
suddenly there is a magic about it
not because sex is magic food is magic no
because we can do it consciously
every basic act like eating and copulating becomes magical
because we can do it consciously
if you leave that one thing
if you exclude that one thing from your life
that you are not conscious about the way you think
the way you feel
the way you act
the way you move your body 
if youre not conscious about it
everything can turn ugly
everything can become nasty
so it is this which sets you apart from every other creature
so a dog is walking on the street
if you show it a biscuit it will wag its tail
if you do this  grrr it will do
if this is what you are that
if somebody is nice to you
you will wag your whatever
if somebody is not nice to you you will bite them im saying what
where is evolution in you
forget about civilization im talking about evolution
wheres the evolution
wheres the sign of evolution im asking 
 okay sadhguruji lets go to hmm
 ive seen people copying answers in examination but never questions
 yeah questions 
well
today many women in our modern society are stepping out and having a career
and i just like to know what do you think of this
of women stepping out being career people managing home as well
being financially independent
is this good
 see every woman should do what she wants to do as an individual person
it should not be made into a trend in a society or the only right thing to do in the world
because i think if if a woman is
intends to have two children and raise them
i think its a full time job
im not saying she should not go out and work
if she wishes to as an individual person shes free to do what she wants to do
but having two children is not about reproduction
youre manufacturing the next generation of people
how the world will be tomorrow
will be determined by what kind of mothers you have today
believe me
you know ive seen many ladies coming to me and say
when i ask whatre you doing
oh im just a housewife
i said why do you say youre just a housewife
you you dont seem to understand the significance of
you know being able to nurture two or three new lives
its not its not a not important job its a very important job
career  i want you to understand
right now because we have made the whole world into economics
unfortunately women also getting as stupid as men
as if how much money you earn is going to determine the value of your life
no
it is just procurement of things that you need
money is just about that
man was procuring
woman was taking about the more beautiful aspects of life
now woman also wants to procure
if there is such an economic need in the family fine she must do it
but it is not a compulsive need
it must not be set up as something better to do than doing something
if she sings so if she if she plays music or if she just loves her children
or if she cooks beautifully
or she just lives beautifully like a flower
its good enough im saying
it is not necessary that only if she earns this much money shes her shes doing something valuable
otherwise shes not
if theres an economic need she can do it
or if she has a passion for doing it she can do it
but let not such values be set up in the world because youre not evolving
youre regressing
youre making survival more important than aesthetics of life 
 okay sadhguruji let me take you away from this
and let me take you to a world of say films where i come from
 world of films okay lets go lets go movies 
 years ago when films started
and you know through the sixties seventies there were lovely stories
nice values beautiful music lyrics
by the time i was the star in movies some of our jhatka matkas might have shocked the previous generations
and they must have said what is all this
but it was still within limits
 whose limits 
i mean whats acceptable to society whatever have been
ill say and then now today the complexion of films
the kind of films we see
you know its little clothed
its livein relationships
or you know up there on screen for everybody to see and night club culture
i mean it sometimes worries me
that my children are growing up now
this is what theyre seeing this is
these are the kind of songs that theyre listening to
the lyrics are about you know
 from janam janam to expiry date is the song 
 yes so this is the
this is what theyre watching this is what they think is cool
this is this is the hip and happening stuff im little
 i think by the time you came the janam janam was over isnt it 
 no it was still there it was in the middle somewhere
the music was wonderful the lyrics was still lovely
but today it is munni badhnaam ho gayi and it things
things have really moved to chewing gums
and im forgetting at this moment what the lyrics are but then its its
its shallow right now
india has the youngest population in the world right now
so with such a young nation growing up on this this is the feed
im just a little concerned as to what they will turn out to be
 im sure your parents were concerned too
 they  okay so can i
 im sure my parents were very concerned when i was growing up
so every parent has this concern every generation has this concern
that the next generation is going wrong always
i understand what youre saying
this sudden change if every generation likes to go
one step beyond where the previous generation has stepped in on eve
almost everything just for the sake of doing something different or its natural theyve grown up in one atmosphere
they take it to another level
 they move to the next level
 yes next is not always next  thats what youre saying
next is not always next right
 yes its not higher
 okay
 its somewhere else its just its
 its just next
so this concern is always there but
right now the change that is happening is not the next
it is a serious influence because
in the last fifteen years the worlds ability to communicate across cultures and borders
is so heavy and so unprecedented
nobody has ever been used to these kind of influences before
okay never before this level of influence on our young people
never before possible
no other generation has ever experienced this kind of onslaught from so many directions
and the volume of influence is too big
so in terms of changes are happening not
it is not next
it is simply somewhere and nobody knows where it is
because its too complex and too mixed
nobody knows where it is including the young people
its just a mix of things
so this is because of a sudden onslaught of information and communication
its not for us to judge whether its good or bad
it is just that definitely this level of information 
when i say information
its like when we were growing up
i believe it was true for your generation also
we we never knew what is boredom okay
this was there was no such thing
we were just excited about everything that came our way
but you see today twelveyearold kids
if you tell them what  ahhm
 yes 
 you see theyre just bored because
they know the whole cosmos there its
they have seen it on their phone screen not even on a computer screen
on the phone screen theyve seen the entire cosmos
they know everything
things that you do not know they know
you ask them they know it
 yes
 by information
by the time theyre eighteen they have had five love affairs and gone 
in the western world its like that here also its beginning to happen okay
so by the time theyre eighteen theyve seen everything that you need to see
with body mind emotion okay
by the time theyre twentyfive what
what next
 what next yes
 no you will see this is not my wish
but this is something that i see the way peoples minds are working
the way theyre being led in with information 
im not a by any standards a pessimistic person
but im just seeing this
if this level of information continues and it will multiply many fold
for the coming generations
you should not be surprised
in the next fifty to hundred years
if fifty percent of the human population choose to commit suicide
you should not be surprised
because that is what will happen to the mind 
somebody is clapping look at this its popular 
 no you have just touched a chord and thats
 no im saying
we think we realize something
 today today
this day more people commit suicide in this world
than all the wars and murders and accidents manage to kill
so more people are on selfhelp already than
murderers war mongers bad drivers everything put together
more people are on selfhelp
and if this level of information onslaught continues on human mind 
i know the nature of mind absolutely because i know my mind
i know how it works what it can handle what it cannot do
i know it clearly what human mind is
thats the reason why i dont have to read peoples books
or listen to their entire thing
if they say one sentence i know what their mind is
because i know the structure of human mind entirely
otherwise i wouldnt be who i am
so im saying this
if this level of information onslaught continues at the same phase or at higher phase
which is possible in the next few years
this will definitely lead to wanting to terminate yourself
because there would be nothing to live for
there is no joy and excitement about anything
you please watch your children
by the time theyre twelve fifteen theyre just bored
you look back at your own life those of you who are over fifty years of age
just look back at in or on your own life
when you were twelve fifteen
was there any room for you to get bored about anything
simply you are excited about every little thing isnt it
 yeah
 today you will see its almost a common feature
twelve fifteen year old kids are just bored only thing is 
 yes they are all on ipads and iphones yes they are on gadgets
 because were talking about love and life 
all this will not mean nothing because you had one love affair when you were eighteen years of age
you thought this is your life and youre going to willing to die for it
whether you died for it or not but at least at that time you thought youll die for it okay
today by the on facebook they had twentytwo love affairs going simultaneously 
it just means nothing
i im not saying they should have it or not have it
all im saying is this will lead to a certain overload on the mind
and suddenly a human being will think why am i here
you know that big shakespearian question
to be or not to be
 yes
 this is not the most intelligent question 
unfortunately people think so
this is only because you have not been touched by life
you are not a piece of life
youre just a psychological case
you are full of thoughts and emotions
you have not touched life at all
you think your thoughts and la emotions are life
no
your thoughts and emotions are the drama that you are creating in your mind
it is your cinema
you must be able to end it somewhere
if you do not know how to put the end then its going on endless cinema youre going crazy
life is happening here
you know your work is not life
your family is not life your career is not life
your cinema is not life your thought is not life
your emotion is not life
life is happening here
everything else is accessories to life
now the frills of life have become larger than life itself
life is entirely missed
if you touch life within you then its an explosion of energy
when such a thing never happens to you
because you have information about the whole cosmos on your phone screen
youll never be touched by life because too much information too much thought
even emotion is drying up too much thought
this has happened
if you look at european philosophy in the last hundred hundred and fifty years
you will see if you read dostoyevsky you will want to commit suicide
brilliant intellectually brilliant
but you will wonder why are you alive
because intellect is like that if you wake up in the morning
devoid of any touching any lifes experience within you
dont think about your childs face
do not think about the flowers in the garden
birds in the sky
nothing beautiful that ever touched you
just think logically you have to get out of bed thats not a small feat
you have to brush your teeth breakfast go to work eat work eat sleep
again tomorrow morning same thing
next fifty years you have to do the same process every day
if you look at it one hundred percent logically and intellectually
you will have no reason to live today morning
tomorrow morning
its only if youre touched by something suddenly its worth living
if youre not touched by anything then its not worth living
what is what is so worth living about a human being 
waking up in the morning
totking tro tr you know troding  through life
trudging through life everyday eating sleeping same rubbish
what is the point
there is no point unless youre touched by something
some magic of life if it doesnt touch you either in the form of love
or in the form of a flower or in the form of something within you
if something doesnt sparkle within you definitely there is a question
whether i should live or not isnt it
and we are taking humanity in that direction with this overload of information
information is not knowing
information is just garbage collection
you just gather things which dont mean anything to you
you look smart in a tea party but youre not smart with life
okay
if youre smart with life you must be blissful isnt it 
if youre really smart with life you must be joyful and blissful isnt it so
youre only smart in a tea party
because you know when somebody is talking something
you know the galaxy z22
what happens there
everybody  wow 
they can also open the internet and the same thing
you see you think this guy visited the galaxy 
 so sadhguruji then what is it
okay so for all of us
give us in clear simple simple sentences 
do this and you will be at least on the way to be blissful or happy or aware or
living in a nice conscious way 
 see if you if you just observe
if everybody makes a little effort
everybody take a little time for this piece of life okay
not for your family
not for your career
not for something else something else
just for this piece of life give it little time
because this is the most important piece of life in your life isnt it
yes or no
 yes
 even if youre in love with somebody 
still this is the most important piece of life isnt it
so pay some attention to this
how does it happen why have you taken it for granted
believe me youre not going to be here for anever
ill bless you with a long life but youre going to fall dead one day 
yes or no
 yes
 so do not take this for granted
if you wake up in the morning
tomorrow if you wake up in the morning 
no this is not my wish but i want you to know
of all that people who go to bed tonight
over a million people will not wake up tomorrow morning
and tomorrow if you and me wake up tomorrow morning
is it not a fantastic thing
a million people did not wake up
you woke up
is it not a great thing
 yes
 just look at the ceiling and smile
you are still awake 
youre still there
a million people did not get up in the morning
and you woke up
and for many many millions of people
somebody who is dear to them did not wake up
so just check those five six people around you
they all woke up  wow its a fantastic day 
you woke up and everybody who matters to you around you woke up
is it not fantastic day
 yes
 you dont think so
 yes 
 yes yes
 you dont seem to think so
because the problem is just this you are living with an idea that you are immortal
when i say youre immortal
youre not actually thinking youre immortal
but youre not conscious of your mortality
if youre not conscious of your mortality
somewhere you think youre immortal isnt it
how many moments in a day are you conscious that youre mortal
if you were conscious would you have time to crib
would you have time to fight with somebody
would you have time to do some rubbish with your life
if you knew
if youre conscious that you are mortal you would do nothing
other than what is absolutely needed for you and everybody around you
this one thing if you do
if you just remind yourself you
dont think this is a negative thing
death is not a negative thing its the only thing which has added value to your life
if youre here forever you would be unbearable 
 yeah  yes yes
 isnt it
arent we glad everybody dies one day 
if you just become conscious of this one thing
that always youre conscious that im mortal
you dont have to think i will die today
we dont intend we want to live as far as possible
just you know one day i will die
if youre just conscious of this one thing
you will naturally become spiritual
you will not become spiritual by thinking about god
you will become unrealistic hallucinatory you will start talking to somebody
you will start doing all kinds of things
already people you know they have ear phones on and theyre talking
you dont know whether theyve lost it or they 
ten years ago if somebody was walking on the street talking you would know that hes lost
but today you dont know 
whether they got their head phones on
or they just lost it and theyre talking we cannot make out
but if you are conscious that youre mortal every moment of your life
spiritual process has begun for you
so the one one of the main reasons
one of the fundamental reasons why that all these things have to be taught to you that she is repeatedly asking this question
were you born special did you have normal birth or not is simply because
most people have forgotten they are mortal
they think theyre immortal they may not actually think theyre immortal
but theyre not conscious they are mortal
with every step with every breath if they were conscious of this
you know how consciously they would live
they would become fantastic it is your mortality which makes you want to know what is the nature of your existence
you really want to know where you came from where you will go only when it sinks into you
all this drama pup  one day it will end
but right now you think only others appear in obituary columns
you are only going to read it 
 that was that was simply beautiful
 thats all thats needed
if you want to know the value of life
just know that its a brief happening
the time that you spend here as life its a very relative experience
if youre truly joyful and ecstatic its horribly brief believe me
i feel like i was born day before yesterday
see already how i have become   okay
  yes yes
 but on a particular day if youre depressed or miserable
one day seems like an endless thing
so only miserable people have a looooooooong life 
if youre a joyful ecstatic person life is always brief
if you live to be hundred its still very brief
for what possibilities a human being carries for the immensity of what a human being is 
its too brief a life
if youre given hundred years two hundred years its still still too brief
because before you know whats happening before you exp exp explore a few dimensions of life itll be over
itll be over over okay
only miserable people have a very long life
they feel its very long 
 sadhguruji here we have a few questions
the first stion is from prabhas sundaras sundar sen 
where and how do we draw the line between loving unconditionally
and becoming a doormat 
 see we need to understand this 
whats being right now passed around as love is generally a mutual benefit scheme
you give me this ill give you that
if you dont give me that i dont give you this
this is not said but its done 
 okay 
 its done isnt it
its not said
so human beings have physical psychological emotional economic social
and various other kinds of needs
to fulfill these things
when you say i love you
instead of making these things ugly needs that we have to
ugly transactions that we have to do  you give me this you give me that
to bring some aesthetic and beauty to this transaction
we quote it with a certain amount of sweetness of emotion
which we call as love affair
where the transactions happen more smoothly
because once we are human somehow doing basic transactions in a basic way makes us feel ugly
if you take food with both your hands and eat it its ugly isnt it
we want to eat in a certain way
similarly to fulfill our physical needs
emotional needs economic needs we have arrangements
where we can conduct this in a more aesthetic manner
im not saying its right or wrong this is the fact of life
so this level of love
i call this
this is enough for to fulfill the domestic needs of ones
you know for two people to live together
to fulfill their needs
to produce children
to raise them domestic level of love affair people can have
but if people want to have a love affair which will bring them to an ultimate union
then not many people are competent to do that
not people not many people are ready to have that kind of a love affair
where itll make two lives into one
two becomes actually one in experience
that will need something more
most people are competent of using love to fulfill the domestic needs
but to go beyond that they are not ready
when i say theyre not ready either
im not talking about this person or that person
so when one is ready and another is not ready or
one is making an effort and another doesnt have the effort
then it feels like somebody is becoming a doormat
that is what it is that it feels like theyre being exploited
but above all one who is longing to become use love as a way of ultimate union
should not be bothered about being doormat this and that
in india we have a culture
where by choice people name themselves as slaves
you know ramdas krishnadas this das that das
what is this
theyre openly saying im a slave
im a doormat
i want to be a doormat
they are not saying im afraid ill be used as a doormat
theyre saying i want to be doormat
so this is a kind of love that theyre wanting to use to
use for ultimate union
this is not for domestic purposes
so if youre looking for ultimate union then love is a different affair
if youre looking for conducting of domestic affairs
then you must manage dignity
who gets what
if anybody is using more than what they should then
if you dont give me that i dont give you this okay
otherwise if youre looking for ultimate union
you should not think of all these things thats a different affair
thats not for normal social thing
if you fall in love itself you become vulnerable to somebody
 yes
 without becoming vulnerable there is no love affair
you have to fall
when you fall somebody may raise you
or somebody may walk over you 
 yes
 but the thing is the
the experience of your life is beautiful
because you fell not because they raised you
not because they walked over you
because you could actually have the sense of abandon in you to fall
that was the beauty of your love affair
not what they gave you what they did to you this  no
the beauty was you sat alone and you think you really loved this person
so much youre willing to die
that was the most beautiful moment 
not the moment they gave you a big gift
not the moment they gave you a diamond ring
not the moment they said this and that about you  no
you just sat here and youre willing to die that was the moment
not just a doormat
youre willing to be the dust on their feet okay
im not saying you should be like that 
im saying where love transformed itself into a devotion
if you fall in love itself you become very vulnerable
but there are still some shreds of sanity in love affairs that you can recover
but if you become a devotee there is no sanity left and you cannot recover
so before you tread such a land
you must see whether youre for it or not
what are your goals first of all
if your goal is to make a life a cautioned
a very measured love affair is good
but youre your your thing is you want to dissolve into the process of life
you dont want to have a good life
youre not planning to have a good life
you just want to become explosion of life
you dont care what you get and what you dont get
then you become a devotee
a devotion means its your intention to dissolve into your object of devotion
so a devotee is not expecting whether ill become a doormat or a crown on somebodys head
whatever i become as long as i can touch your feet or head or whatever
its fine with me
 yeah
 so thats a different state of existence
i dont think
somebody who is looking for domestic level of love affair should even ask that question 
 mmm we have one question from the social media the facebook 
amitmadan wants to know
in this materialistic age the real feeling of love is disappearing from our life
most of the love we receive from others and express to others is superficial
how can we reinforce the real feeling of love in our own life and in others
 forget about others
if you
if you learn to be loving by your own nature
not because of somebody else or something else
i know the question is coming from facebook
theres an enormous possibility 
you can even love those people who dont even exist 
so im saying its a tremendous possibility
so 
if you just become love
not love somebody then you will know the nature of love
if you love somebody its a fickle happening
because no human being will happen hundred percent the way you want them
every human being on this planet is going to disappoint you believe me
not because theyll do something wrong because nobody can fulfill the
unrealistic expectation you have of them
its simply not possible
have you been able to fulfill anybodys expectation im asking you entirely
partially but never entirely isnt it
so nobody else will be able to do it
unless youre a still such a hopeless romantic
youre still waiting that ideal person is going to come from somewhere 
no
believe me whoever comes
i want you to know the ideal people whom you worship
when krishna was there his wives complained  all right
 so there is no hope for us
yes
please remember this  okay
sadhguruji this is where we open yes the platform
its anybody has a question this is the moment
 my name is ananth
my question is about marriage
divorce
 no no they are two different things 
 what i see today is many youngsters like many of them they dont want to marry
and few of them who marry
there are occasions where they are getting divorced
so would you like to throw some light on this situation sadhguru
 see you need to understand the institution of marriage
one thing is as we said a little while ago
its about bringing a certain sanctity to the simple basic needs that every human being has
i will repeat there are physical needs
there are psychological needs
there are economic needs
emotional needs
social needs
variety of needs
to fulfill all these things we set up an institution called marriage
where all these can be conducted in a sensible manner
otherwise if we did it on the streets like every other creature
it would turn ugly for us
and we will feel not good about it
so to bring some sense of organization
some aesthetic
some stability
because man and woman coming together naturally brought fresh life
the nature of human life
the nature of human offspring is such
that because of the possibilities that a human being carries
it is compared to any other creature it is the most helpless life
which needs maximum amount of support
you could leave a puppy on the street
as long as he gets food he grows up into a good dog
no problem
but not so with a human being
he doesnt need just physical support
he needs variety of support and stab above all the stable situation
whether there should be marriage in society or not
one will debate when they are eighteen because
physical body is asking for freedom all right
at that time everybody questions 
is marriage really needed
why cant we just live whichever way we want
but when you are three years of age you valued marriage immensely
a stable marriage immensely
isnt it so
yes or no
 yes yes
 not yours
your parents
 the parents yes 
 when you were three four of yours
three four years of age youre one hundred percent for marriage
again when you become fortyfive fifty again youre hundred percent for marriage
between and eighteen and thirtyfive youre questioning the whole process 
okay
 thats true 
 im not saying marriage is the thing but do you have a better alternative
if you have a better alternative
damn the marriage
but you have not come up with a better alternative
because a stable situation is a must for a child
once you have a child its a twenty year project  okay
that is if they do well
if they dont do well its a lifelong project 
so if you want to get into such projects
at least twenty years there must be a commitment to create a stable situation
your whims and fancies will change
your emotions will change
if that is what it is dont get into such situations
its not compulsory for everybody to get married
its good young pe you were saying people are thinking whether to get married
im glad it is not necessary for everybody
but if you get into it and if you especially if you get into children
you must understand its a minimum twenty year project
whether you like it or you dont like it
otherwise you shouldnt get into those projects
you dont walk into a project
drop it half way and walk away isnt it
they have their benefits and they have their problems
its your choice but at least choose consciously
you dont have to get married because everybody is getting married
you dont have to talk about marriage and divorce in same breath
as if they come together 
this is a completely an american idea
youre thinking of marriage and divorce together
nobody thought of divorce in this country till recently isnt it
why should you ever talk about marriage and divorce in one breath
its its a crime
its really a crime to think on those lines
but if it so happens
something truly went wrong between two people
and they have to separate that will any way inevitably happen
you dont have to plan it at the time of wedding 
 namaskaram sadhguru
namaskaramjuhi mam
you mentioned about survival
and you talked about aesthetics of life
i would like
i would request you to elaborate on aesthetics of life
and my second question is for my friend 
i dont know whether you will answer it or not
but i just want to mention it over here
because she has requested me to do so
her question is
what is the purpose of this universe
 oh tell your friend i didnt make it 
 thank you so much
 why am i being blamed for these things  i
the only thing i have done is ive figured the nature of my life
and by figuring the nature of this life
i know by inference
every life has happened the same way
not just every life
the very cosmos has happened the same way
if you know the nature of this life from its origin to its ultimate
you know the nature of everything by inference
everything thats worth knowing
so tell your friend i didnt make this universe
so dont blame me for such big things
i just figured my way through my life
and we should figure it
if you figure it you will see the most important thing thats happening in your life right now is
that youre alive
nothing else
not that stocks have gone up today thats not the most important thing
not your love affair
not this and that 
if you dont understand what im saying
suppose tomorrow you lost im not saying you must wish
im not wishing you must loose
but suppose tomorrow you lost half your money and youre feeling depressed
and your mind says i want to die
close your mouth hold your nose like this  for two minutes
your body says to hell with your money i want to live 
tomorrow you found your love affair collapsed
and your mind says i want to die
check  
the life within you says to hell with your love affair i want to live
every time you feel little suicidal or depressed
just check 
the life within you says to hell with all these things i want to live
so i want to know the most important thing thats happening to you right now is life itself
not the fancy thoughts that you have
not the emotions that you have
not financial arrangements
or family arrangements
or whatever rubbish you have built around you
these are all accessories to life
these are all frills
frills are so much youre missing the skirt
thats the whole problem with you 
yes
so much frill
fundamental things are forgotten 
so this is the most important thing
right now for most people life means their job
life means the new house theyre building
life means the car that they bought
life means their wife their husband their children 
no
life means whats throbbing here 
not even your body
not your mind
not your thought
not your emotion
what is right now throbbing here  this is life
because this is on everything else seems to be meaningful
if this one stops nothing around you means any damn thing to you or to anybody
