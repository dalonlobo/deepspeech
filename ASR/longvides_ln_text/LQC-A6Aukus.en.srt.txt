 in appreciation of this commendable cause
that the dharma foundation has taken up
i would like to say that
for thousands of years
for the longest period compared to anything on this planet
this wisdom
this dimension of knowing has lived on
without any kind of true organization
or a certain kind of leadership
or any other kind of organized support
out of sheer efficacy of what it is
it's just lived on
a time has come in the world
when
where even truth has to be protected 
when we talk about east
we are not talking about a particular geography
this must be clearly understood 
we are not talking about east and west
as geographical features in the world
any number of great minds in america
have said things
of great reverence and admiration
for the socalled eastern wisdom
thoreau 
one of the greatest minds america produced
went out to say
every morning i bathe my intellect
in this stupendous and cosmogono knowledge from the east
in comparison
all our modern world and literature is puny and trivial
i think mark twain went out to
probably gave out the best compliment to the east
when he visited india for a little over three months
he said
anything that can ever be done
either by man or god has been done in this land
any number of others 
oppenheimer referring to american physicist
walden 
emerson 
any number of people have said many many things
why
why is it important
why is it important to preserve and nurture this dimension of life
the fundamental reason
why it seems to be so significantly different is
because it is not a product of human intellect
it is not deductions that we made out of our intellect
this dimension comes from a profound inner experience
where there is no right and wrong
there is no up and down
just seeing things the way they are
and when we say dharma
we are not talking about a religion
as modern translators went about interpreting dharma as
hindu dharma or whatever
another religion
because they came from a mindset
that everybody has to belong to some segment of humanity
they come from a mindset
where humanity has to be divided one way or the other
because they come from the surface intelligence of human nature
which we call as intellect
unfortunately the modern societies
modern education systems have entirely dedicated themselves
to the human intellect
completely ignoring other dimensions of intelligence
which definitely exist within us
when you go by the intellect
the nature of the intellect is always to dissect and divide
because intellect is essentially discriminatory in nature
an intellect functions always with a certain identity
if you have no identity
you cannot use your intellect
so with individual identities
either of race religion nationality caste creed gender
when you apply your intellect
itll split the world into many pieces
so the significance of what we are referring to as
the spirit of eastern wisdom is
it does not come from human intellect
it comes from a deeper dimension of intelligence within us
when i say a deeper dimension of intelligence
a simplistic way of looking at it would be
whatever you had for lunch today
if you had a piece of bread
over the afternoon
this bread is being transformed into a human being
you definitely cannot do that with your intellect
theres an intelligence here 
which is capable of making a banana into a human being
you definitely cannot do that with your intellect
a dimension of intelligence which is beyond thought process
thought or the product of intellect
is essentially always functioning
from a limited amount of data that we have gathered
now what we call as eastern wisdom
is not coming from a limited amount of data that we have gathered
either from the books or our life experience
but simply by enhancing our ability to perceive life
in ways that the five sense organs cannot function
why im talking about the five sense organs is
all the data that you have ever gathered
which rests in so many aspects within you
which is the food for the intellect
comes from the five sense organs
in the very nature of things
sense organs cannot perceive the entirety of anything
if you can see this part of my hand 
you cannot see this part of my hand 
this is the nature of sense perception
even if you take a grain of sand
if you see one part of it
you cannot see the other face of it
sense organs can only perceive in comparison
if there is no comparison
your senses are useless
because there is darkness
you know what is light
otherwise you just would not know what is light
if light was on all the time and there was no darkness
you would not know what is light
because there is silence you know what is sound
if there was no silence
you would not have the idea of what is sound
so always in comparison
it is like
let's say youre six feet tall
now you walk like a tall man
you think like a tall man
you feel like a tall man
you are a tall man 
you went to another society where everybody is eight feet tall 
suddenly you walk like a short man
think like a short man
feel like a short man and you are a short man 
so what you perceive in comparison is a distortion of reality
it is not reality as it is
so whatever we perceive in comparison is useful for our survival process
but if we want to know know the nature of this existence
sense organs are not sufficient instruments
what is light for you is darkness for many other creatures
you ever got into an argument with an owl 
if you did which is light which is darkness
where would it go 
it would be endless argument
who is right you or the owl
hmm
 both
 oh if youre saying both  either you belong to the diplomatic corps 
or you have a successful marriage 
you have learned to say both both both for everything 
youre right
well that is the basis of all the problems on the planet 
im right and you are wrong 
the fact of the matter is
you are perceiving it as it is necessary for your survival
the owl is perceiving it as it is necessary for his survival
if survival is all youre seeking
your five sense organs and intellect are sufficient instruments
but if you want to know the nature of the existence
if you want to know the fundamental laws or dharma which governs life
the way it happens within us and around us
then you need an inner perception
or another dimension of intelligence within you
otherwise you will only cut the world into pieces
in the name of religions
we have cut the world into humanity into many pieces
because intellectually we have arrived at our own
conclusions or deductions
which invariably is bound to divide
because intellect is essentially a knife which cuts
it can only dissect
by dissection you can know certain things
but if you really want to know someone that you love
you dont dissect them you embrace them 
by dissection you may know the kidney liver heart stuff
but you will not know that being in any sense
you will lose it completely
so dissection is the way of the intellect
because it is a sharp instrument
it has to cut it cut open everything thats given to it
but the east found another way
out of profoundness of experience you can know life
by turning inward you can know life
when i say turning inward
you must understand that essentially
the five sense organs are always outward
you can see what's around you
but you cannot roll your eyeballs inward and scan yourself
you can hear this 
but so much activity in this body
you cannot hear this
if an ant crawls upon this hand you can feel it
so much blood flowing you cannot feel it
because in the very nature of things
sense organs are outward bound
the moment you dedicate yourself to your intellect
you also get enslaved to the limitations of your five senses
it is in this context
the wisdom of the east is of tremendous significance to the world
because it has transcended this slavery to sense perception
and learned to perceive life in a completely different way
what is this completely different way
in english language
if you say mind it is just one word
it is supposed to say everything
in the yogic culture
there are sixteen parts to the mind
sixteen dimensions of human mind
now if i go into sixteen it would take too much time
so let me compress it into four 
the four aspects of the mind are called
buddhi
ahankara
manas
and chitta
buddhi means the intellect
today modern world is largely run by the intellect
so with this we can do many things on the outside
we can go on enhancing the comforts and conveniences of life
weve done very well
in terms of comforts and conveniences
never before
never ever before
another generation of humanity ever knew
the kind of comforts and conveniences that we have today
but at the same time
we are whining like never before 
because as the comforts and convenience increase on the outside
as there is less to complain about what is happening around you
the emptiness of within echoes within you in a horrible way
when youre fighting for survival
when every day you are struggling to fix small things on the outside
you will not realize this
when outside is well settled
that is when you will see how hollow life has become
the biggest question in the world 
you will see in the next few decades  is
what the hell are we doing here anyway
because everything that needs to be fixed on the outside is done
now what
72 billion people on the planet
but right now gradually it's looming large
loneliness is one of the biggest problems
dogs are being tortured to fulfill human loneliness 
because as you dedicate yourself more and more to your intellect
you will naturally become more and more lonely
because it keeps on dissecting and cutting life into various pieces for examination
and then you will see you yourself will be split up into many parts after some time
if you go by the intellect hundred percent
the next dimension of the mind is referred to as ahankara
normally people think it means ego
no it means identity
youre identified with something
the moment youre identified with something
your intellect will work only to protect that identity
no matter what whichever way you think
your ideas of which nation you belong to
which race you belong to
which culture you belong to
which religion you belong to
which gender you belong to
the moment you get identified
your intellect will work only to protect that identity
so it is a certain kind of prejudice
well you may say
im not prejudiced im very broadminded
all right it's a broad prejudice 
because people are willing to live and die for what theyre identified with
because the nature of the intellect is
if you take away the identity
it will not know what to do
it needs a strong identity
a strong sense of who i am
if you ask who am i
your intellect will not function
you must know who you are  
a strong sense of belief that this is what i am
that is when your intellect will function in a certain way
this is like
intellect is like a sharp knife
ahankara or the identity is the hand that holds it
all the suffering on the planet
when was the last time when somebody stabbed you
even though youre living in la  i am asking
when was the last time it happened
never happened
maybe when you were in school somebody poked you with a pin at the most
or they even that did not happen
they ignored you 
or what im saying is
how much suffering for a human being is actually coming from outside
almost nothing
rest is all selfhelp 
because this  is a sharp knife given to you
unsteady hand
every day it's cutting itself
you know we were  we were trekking in nepal and tibet region
and i was in a tent
someone was cutting an apple
and someone else another person says
this is a very sharp knife be careful
it irritates me because such an obvious thing
you call it a knife only because its sharp 
if that damn thing is not sharp why will i call it a knife 
and if it's a child
yes
a full grown man you dont tell him its a sharp knife 
i ignored it and i was working on something
another two minutes again it is said
it's a very sharp knife be careful
i said come on leave him alone 
hes a grown man leave him alone this is
he is not handling some super instrument
a knife
he should know how to handle a knife
no no sadhguru it's a very sharp knife 
all right
i get back to my work
two minutes later he cuts his hand 
okay
now the problem is just this
youve been given a sharp knife
unsteady hand
every day cutting yourself
you may call it stress
you may call it anxiety
you may call it fear
you may call it misery
you call it what you want
all thats happening is your intellect is working against you
thats all it is
unless somebody is stabbing you from outside thats a different issue
we need to deal with that differently
rest is all your own intelligence turning against you
you may call it thousand different
no no my motherinlaw my boss my neighbor
they are
they are not stabbing you
theyre only saying what they want to say
it is you who is poking yourself because an unsteady hand thats all
but this intellect cannot function without a memory bank
so what is called as manas is a silo of memory
there are eight dimensions of memory
let's not go into the detail but you know this much 
there is a conscious memory
today theyre recognizing a subconscious memory
you know there is genetic memory
you may not remember how your greatgreatgreatgrandfather looked like
but his nose is sitting on your face 
a million years ago how your forefathers were
even today your body remembers
you may not remember here 
but your body remembers every aspect of it
even the color of the skin it is remembering not forgotten
so there is genetic memory
there is evolutionary memory
like this theres a profound dimension of memory in the body
there are trillion times more memory in your body than in your mind
so this is why this  is called as manomayakosha
this is an entire manas not in one place
intellect may be up here 
but the manas spreads right through the system
every cell in the body has a memory of its own
has an intelligence of its own
now the fourth dimension of intelligence is called chitta
this is a dimension of intelligence which is unsullied by memory
if you touch this dimension
then the memory has no influence on you
your genetic memory your evolutionary memory
your conscious memories unconscious memory subconscious memory
whatever kinds of memories you have
it has no influence on you
or in other words past cannot recycle itself through you
see right now you take on this form because of a certain memory
it's a certain software
tch if you eat let's say youre a man and you eat a piece of bread
this piece of bread turns into a man
you are woman and you eat a piece of bread the same piece of bread turns into a woman
you give it to your dog it turns into a dog
very intelligent bread 
it is just the memory that you carry
here  there is a memory
which transforms everything the way it is
so this dimension of intelligence which is called as chitta
which is untouched by any kind of memory
just pure intelligence is of significance
because it's beyond
it is beyond your species
it is beyond your form
its beyond your gender
it's beyond your culture
it's beyond every kind of influence which is essentially memory within you
may be unconscious
but it is memory playing out in so many ways
as long as memory is playing out
what it means is
youre
in india we say you are in a state of samsara
samsara means lot of people today understand as family 
samsara doesnt mean family
samsara means a cyclical life
you are in cycles of life
if youre in cycles or if youre going in circles
what does it mean
that means youre not getting anywhere thats what it means
a cycle is nice
it gives you good exercise
this is like running on a treadmill
if youre seeking exercise it's good
but if you want to go somewhere it's no good
if you put your treadmill out here and keep running on it
morning becomes evening
fall becomes winter
winter becomes summer
everything will happen
seasons will change
scenery will change
everything will happen
only thing is you dont go anywhere
this is what samsara means
as long as youre functioning within the first three dimensions of intelligence
youre in a cyclical mode
it is all right to exercise yourself
but its not good to go somewhere
so if you want to transcend the samsara nature of who you are
or the cyclical nature of your existence
then you touch the dimension of intelligence which is referred to as chitta
why the socalled eastern wisdom is of great significance
why the dharma of the east is so significant and important is
because this comes from chitta
this does not come from buddhi
this does not come from manas
this does not come from ahankara
this comes from chitta
and only that which does not come from your individual identity or individual memory
that can be truly universal
so for this we said
this is sanathan dharm
this does not mean hindu religion
this is a very wrong conception
sanathan dharm means the ultimate law of nature
when we say nature there is physical nature and there is an inner nature
there are two dimensions for this
accordingly we made two dimensions of laws
physical nature is a changing thing
it's always in a process of change and a flux
but the inner nature is a constant process
so we made two dimensions of expression for this dharma
called shruthis and smrithis
one is always to be updated for every generation
otherwise two generations will keep on bickering and clashing 
you have to update it
another is eternal
its always there
it's nobodys business to change it
because it cannot be changed because the fundamentals of life has not changed
based on this an entire wisdom arose
as to how to exist within you
and how to operate around you
this happened in 1924
there was a bishop in the orthodox greek religion
where you know
there is orthodox greek segment of christians
they have a pope of their own in istanbul
they believe they are the only true christians
others are all riffraff according to them
so he served this particular segment which is very orthodox and rigid
being in istanbul
being on the silk route
all kinds of stories of indian mysticism kept wafting across the bosporus
so he has a longing to go to india
and see a real yogi or a mystic
but being a man of cloth
he could not choose where to go and where not to go
after he passed sixty years of age
when he semiretired
he got an opportunity and went to india
and came to southern india
so his desire is to meet a real yogi
not a book yogi
not a studio yogi but a real one 
so somebody directed him and said
go up this hill there in this kind of place there will be one yogi
so he went up
well hes not made for the mountains
he went huffing and puffing up and then he found in front of a small cave
a yogi was sitting eyes closed totally blissed out
he went there and
he has been told that if you see a indian yogi
you must prostrate
well he was not made for that 
but he somehow managed
huffed and puffed and sat down
hearing this commotion
the yogi opened his eyes and smiled
immediately the bishop looked at him and said
can i ask you a question
the yogi said by all means
the bishop asked what is life
this is after sixty 
you should have asked this question when you were eight 
at least when youre sixteen  
sixty
but what to do
better late than never 
he asked
then the yogi laughed and went into raptures
oh life
life is like the fragrance of jasmine upon gentle spring breeze 
the bishop looked at him and said
what
life is like fragrance of jasmine upon gentle spring breeze
our teacher told us
life is like a thorn 
once it gets into you 
if you sit it hurts
if you stand it hurts
if you lie down it hurts 
what is this fragrance of jasmine upon gentle spring breeze
so the yogi smiled and said
well thats his life 
so this comes from the fundamental that
when a human being clearly experientially understands
that entire experience of human life is created from within
never from outside
right now as you sit here do you at least see me
even if youre not listening to me im saying 
can you use your hand and show where i am
ah no no youre getting it all wrong
you know im a mystic from south india 
now this light is falling upon me
reflecting going through your lenses
inverted image in the retina you know the whole story
 yes
 where do you see me right now
within yourself
where do you hear me right now
within yourself
where have you seen the entire world
within yourself
have you ever experienced anything outside of yourself
right now someone next to you if they touch you
you think youre experiencing their hand
no
youre only experiencing the sensations in your hand
in the very nature of things
you cannot experience anything outside of yourself
when everything
when the entire experience of life is caused from within you
at least it must happen the way you want it isn't it hmm
the world will not happen the way you want it
at least  the experience of living here within you
must happen the way you want it
if if if your experience of life happened just the way you want it
how would you keep yourself
blissful or miserable
 blissful
 please you must tell me im going to bless you 
blissful or miserable
 blissful
 for yourself  definitely highest level of pleasantness for yourself
what you want for your neighbor may be debatable 
but you know what you want for yourself isn't it
now blissfulness or pleasantness of life is not a goal by itself
it is only when youre blissful by your own nature
that means you determine the nature of your experience
no matter what is the situation
you determine the nature of your experience
or in other words you have no fear of suffering
only and only when there is no fear of suffering
will you walk full stride in this life
otherwise it's always about
what will happen to me
what will happen to me
every step is a half a step
now this socalled spirit of eastern wisdom comes from those beings
who walked full stride
who determined the nature of their experience
the outside never decided who they are
so they could walk full stride and explore the depths and dimensions of life
that others never dared to touch
because most of the humanity is only concerned about
what will happen to me
what will happen to me means what
will i suffer  thats the question
the first and foremost thing
if you truly want to explore dimensions which we are referring to
as another dimension of wisdom or knowing is
that first you must determine the nature of your experience
you have no fear of suffering
only then truly exploring human consciousness becomes a reality
touching dimensions of intelligence
which gives access to the entire universe becomes a possibility
im supposed to open up for questions 
it's time you ask your questions please
 the population i work with
that are in the verge of homelessness or they are addicts
if i tell them that it is your intellect
and it's your perception
and this doesnt exist they will laugh at me
because it definitely exists
 they must because it's the dumbest thing to say 
 right
so i wanted to know this spirituality that you teach
the spirituality that many gurus teach
how is it usable for someone that doesnt have food to eat
and is going to become homeless
and there is so many problems
especially in america
i mean how
of course i teach them resiliency it's a different fact
but every time im going to open my mouth and use some of your teachings
i have to step back 
 now the first problem is that you believe in the teachings because
this is the problem with the entire world 
they have been cultured in some belief or the other
this is what is significant about
what is referred to as sanathana dharma
or what is referred to as the indian way of looking at things is
this is not a land of belief systems
this is a land of seekers
never ever were anybody encouraged to believe anything
if you see anything that comes from that land
you will see
it is all about questions 
never about a belief system
if you enter a indian home
in the same house
five different people are worshiping twentyfive different gods and goddesses
 theyre still not made up their minds
which is laughter
and they have no problem theyll never fight about it 
because it's a land of seeking
so first mistake you make is you believe what i say
i am constantly reminding you
dont believe a goddamn thing that anybody says
but dont be foolish enough to disbelieve it either
all you have to do is experiment with it 
does it work or doesnt work
if it works you keep it otherwise rubbish it what's the problem
now about somebody being hungry
somebody being homeless
somebody being in a war zones 
all kinds of horrible things are happening on the planet
i am not ignorant of it
anyway you said living in a temple
i am not living in a temple
i am more of the world than you are
every day 
i want you to understand
im running a volunteer organization
with over 4000 fulltime volunteers
and over three million parttime volunteers doing variety of work
huge projects
over a dozen businesses
and the spiritual movement okay 
now i want you to understand
more things are going wrong with my life on a daily basis than anybodys life 
now when a man is hungry
if you try to tell him
your intellect is the source of your problem  
it's obscene
it's obscene
it's nothing short of that
i never spoke to hungry people and said
your intellect is the source of the problem
im talking to people whore bulging  in so many ways
in their head and in their body theyre bulging 
im only talking to that segment of the population
those who are not fed well
im doing social projects with them
with nourishment
education
health
all for free
will i ever go and talk to a starved man in an indian village
and tell him
your intellect is the basis of all your problems 
what makes you think that im that stupid  i
do i look like that 
so you also dont do that 
this is for you
you need to understand this there are million problems on the planet
all these million problems are essentially because
those who are reasonably well have never cared to reach out and do
what needs to be done in the world
in many ways theyre making sure those people dont get it
yes
in the year 2012
we have produced enough food for 182 billion people
we had only 66 billion people in that year
but still fifty percent of the population is malnourished
and hardly eaten anything
this is not because there is no food
because
this is because you and me have not cared isn't it
so
is it true
is it true nobody stabbed you in the last twentyfive years
yes
but is it also true youre suffering various things of tension stress anxiety this that
is it a product of your mind
or somebody else poking you from outside
it is your reaction to the existential situation outside
instead of doing what is needed
what you see is
when you see something wrong happening
or when you see some suffering
or something comes your way
you decide to poke yourself
this is about incapacitating yourself
instead of seeing when there is a problem
you need empowerment
not incapacitating yourself isn't it
im talking about empowering you
so that your damn intelligence functions for you
not against you
the moment your intelligence is working against you
no god in the universe is going to help you
and can help you
yes
if your intelligence has turned against you
you are a finished case
so im saying first let your intelligence work for you
if it works for you
there are many miraculous things that you can do
for all those people who have still not eaten properly
for whom basic things have not been taken care of
thats our business because
somehow weve landed in a place
where you and me are at least eating well
once we are in such a privilege
we must use our intelligence to see what is the best thing we can do in the world
not sit here and twist yourself out
im saying dont twist yourself out
if youre joyful
naturally you will do the best things you can do
if i meet you when youre very happy
will you be nice to me
 ill always be nice to you
 no no no 
i dont believe that
when youre very happy if i meet you im sure youre a wonderful person
but when youre depressed when youre unhappy when youre frustrated
if i meet you you could be a nasty person
 yes
 this is true with every human being isn't it
so the first and foremost work that any human being has to do is
that you make this  into a pleasant piece of life
so that you naturally exude this pleasantness in every possible way
if this  is feeling unpleasant
and you tell this one to be pleasant
is it going to work
we are trying to fix the stomach full people right now 
 it was a pleasure listening to you unbelievable
but my question is
what can i do so that i can acquire your skill of clarity
honesty 
and honestly generally speaking
very few people you know are like you are
im sure you have heard this before 
so what makes you
what makes you so secure from within and be so candid
honest
truthful
clarity of expression 
 i didnt know thats a popular question 
when we say clarity
that means tch 
i want to tell you a joke but it's
it's a dirty joke so i thought ill skip that one 
 go for it
 please tell
 no no ill s ill come with something milder you know 
the problem with the human being right now is this 
we have created a world
we have created education systems
where we believe that
human beings are essentially all wrong
or the creation is all wrong
or the source of creation or the creator is all wrong
and youre going to fix it 
this is a convoluted idea
instead of paying attention to life
we are coming up with philosophies and philosophies and philosophies
philosophies are fantastic explanations to that which cannot be explained
if you want to know life
you must pay attention to life isn't it
right now do you agree with me madam
that this human mechanism is the most sophisticated machine on the planet
 yes
 do you agree with me
are you a doctor
 yes
 yes 
so this  is such a complex machine
this  is the super super computer all right
im asking have you bothered to read the users manual 
if you understand how this  functions
you would know how to use it
even if you take a simple gadget like a phone
the more you know about it the better you can use it
isn't it so
you have definitely coming from india
you have definitely been bombarded with this thing about
realization
selfrealization
 yes
 let me put it in very simple terms
what selfrealization means is
first of all what the word realization means 
realization is not an achievement
it is not an accomplishment
it is just realization
that means something thats always here
you just managed to see it now
that means you were stupid all your life 
just now you saw it 
you did not invent something new
you did not ramp yourself up to a mountain
no
you just saw the most obvious thing which was always here 
you realized
so
realization means you realized how foolish you have been
everything has been right here
and you didnt get it
so there are many ways
of course most of you being from the indian origin
i have not read this
i have to admit i have never read the gita 
because it never occurred to me
im sorry 
i know this is a shock 
but you know be
living in india
bits and pieces of this are always floating around in the air and it's
you know many pieces of it
but ive never really studied it in any sense
so when on a certain moment
when arjuna asked
what is the nature of this truth that youre talking about
where is it
so krishna laughed and said
the highest truth about your life is at the tip of your nose
now there are many schools of yoga intensely focusing on the tips of their noses

please try it for two minutes you will get a headache 
you will not get enlightened 
what he is saying is it is the most obvious thing
it is the most obvious thing
but right now the problem is
all the instruments of perception that you have are outward bound
but the seat of your experience is within you
the fundamental seat of your experience is within you
but all the instruments of perception are outward bound
so how should i do this
you must understand
anything beyond survival if it has to enter your life
some striving is needed
let's say
as a little infant
you were left in the jungle without human contact
if something edible came in front of you
would you first try your ears
then nostrils
and somehow by accident find your mouth
is that so
you would just know where to put it isn't it
so what im saying is everything that is necessary for survival
is built into you
it
youre born with it
the five senses takes care of it
but if you want to know something more
you have to strive
for example
do you remember
when you were three four or five years of age
you had to learn to write the alphabet
that damn a how complicated it was
and they on top it there were two versions 
you had to write it a hundred times to get it isn't it
but today with your eyes closed
you can write
if that striving was not there
today could you write
today would you know language
so anything beyond survival needs striving
without the needed striving it wont happen
there are ways to perceive the interiority of who you are
but unfortunately theres been no striving
right now we made this technology into such a simple
almost like a physical science
a plus b equals this or
two parts of hydrogen one part of oxygen
water will come
if a great scientist puts it together only water will come
an idiot puts it together only water will come
so we made the entire yoga sutras like this
that if you do this this and this
this will happen to you
that simple and all im asking  generally from people is
about thirty thirty to thirtytwo hours of focused time
to develop an instrument where they can turn inward
ooof thirty hours is too much 
im saying if you cannot dedicate
a little bit of time to know what this  is
that means your existence must be truly worthless
if this  is worthwhile
you must pay attention to this  isn't it
if you want to know life
this  is life isn't it
when i say the word life
maybe youre thinking about your profession
your family
your car
your home
no
these are all accessories
this  is life isn't it so
hello
 yes 
 but no attention has been paid
your idea of fixing life is fixing all kinds of things
this happened one day
shankaran pillai was going home 
no im not done 
shankaran pillai was going home
30 in the evening
the rules at home 
00 he must be home
30
he thought there is still time
let me have a quick drink and go
he just stepped into the local bar
he had a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick drink and a quick drink 
then he looked at the time  
00 am
tch
you know drinking people are like yogis
they become timeless 
theres a certain correlation 
then it's late and he got off the bar stool and tried to walk
it's such an unfair world
a man is supposed to walk on a round planet
as if thats not enough it spins 
you notice that the planet is round and it's spinning
only when youve had a few drops more
or a few drops are missing between your two ears 
either youre drunk or you have a vertigo
then you notice the planet is round and spinning
otherwise you think it's flat and youre going on fine 
so with great difficulty he was walking sideways
and trying to find his way home
he was crossing a garden and he flipped over
and fell face down into a rose bush
his face became a mess
then he somehow reached home and you know
these keyholes are so minute
it took twenty minutes to find the keyhole
then he found his way up to the bedroom
and then he went into the bathroom
and he looked at his face
it was a real mess
then he opened the medicine cabinet
took out medicine
plaster
band aid
fixed himself up and slowly crawled into the bed
fortunately the wife is a big sleeper 
he slept
morning eight oclock
the wife 
took a bucketful of cold water and splashed it on him
aahh  
water boarded he woke up
he said why why it's only a sunday
she said
you fool again drinking shes
he said honey six months ago i promised you
since then i havent touched a drop
she grabbed him by the shirt
and took him into the bathroom and showed him 
all the plaster was on the mirror 
why
why people have lost their clarity 
why people have lost their clarity is only because of this 
that if there is any suffering here 
they think this one  should be fixed 
if something else happens that one should be fixed
if something else happens that one should be fixed 
every day morning prayer means what
trying to fix the god 
yes
youre trying to fix up the god isn't it
so day in and day out
for everything that happens within you
instead of fixing this one 
youre trying to fix everything around you
no wonder you will be confused
weve fixed the planet sufficiently
at least in this part of the world
if you fix it any more therell be no planet left
but are people bursting with ecstasy
no
so because
clarity has been lost simply because of this
if you understand
if life has to really become beautiful for you
this one  has to be fixed
if you understand this one thing
clarity will dawn within you 
 i actually have a question on chitta
how can we tap into chitta which is
what you said
memory with no effect and the ability to break the cycles
 right here you want to do that 
you can
you can take one fundamental step today
that is i want you to
anyway youre youve already written down the question also
you have the habit of writing things
so you just sit down today before you go to bed
write down what are all the different types of identities
that you have taken 
starting from your body
everything else
just write it down and see
if you can create a little distance from these identifications
just work on that
thats the first step
that you are not identified with anything
youre just here
throbbing as a piece of life
not as this or that
see
but what can i do i am a young woman
right now yes
when you sit here among people
if youre just walking by yourself in the garden
you dont really think youre a young woman
or if you are that identified
you can't help it even there
if you just doze off a little bit
you dont sleep as a young woman
you just sleep simply as life isn't it
im saying something so fundamental as your body and gender
even that identity is only on the surface
your caste creed religion race 
this is even more on the surface
so im saying
you can't do it in the day right now but before you go to bed
see if you can keep all your identities by the bedside table and sleep
hmm
to work in the world you need an identity
without identity you cannot function in the world
so before going to sleep
take off all the identities
keep it on your bedside table 
morning itll be there itll not go anywhere 
leave it there and go to sleep
you have started the journey
 i would like to hear gurujis turning point in life
where he separated himself from his intellect
and his inner self
 do i look like someone who lost my intellect

i didnt think that i was coming out so dumb

this is shes asking for a story
do you want a story
 yes 
 okay 
one must understand
it's a process that you set forth
tch this started happening to me when i was just
around four fourandahalf years of age
i suddenly realized one day that i dont know anything
i dont know anything means
i dont know anything at all
to such an extent
if somebody gives me a glass of water
i would not know what is water
i know if i drink this water itll quench my thirst
and different ways of using it
i know what to do with it but i dont know what it is
well actually if you look at it
even today you dont know what it is
its the only substance present in the planet in all three different states
three fourths of the planet is water
nearly three fourths of your body is water
if youre looking for life you look for a drop of water
theres lot of excitement they found a few drops on the mars 
i think people from california need to migrate 
so im just staring at this glass of water for hours on end
if i found a dry leaf im just looking at the leaf for five six hours at a stretch
if i sit up in my bed staring at the darkness
the entire night im sitting like this staring
my dear father being a physician
started thinking i need psychiatric evaluation 
this boy is simply staring at something or the other
unblinking hes staring
hes lost it 
my problem is i look at this one
i still do not know this one
there is no way im able to shift my attention to another one
so i
it just held my attention i couldnt shift
in this condition they sent me to school 
and my mother said
pay attention to the teachers
i went and paid attention to the teachers  
the kind of attention that they have never received in their life 
and initially i understood the words that they were speaking
and what they were trying to say
after some time i realized theyre just making sounds
im making up the meanings in my head
even now as i speak im only making sounds
youre making up the meanings isn't it
because language is a conspiracy between two people 
if you have a conspiracy what do you do
the indians you speak in your language 
in india we have this advantage
we have 1300 languages in the country
we can have lots of conspiracies going 
because well speak in our own language
actually im only makings sounds isn't it
youre making up the meanings
so when i realized im the one who making up all the meanings
i stopped making the meanings
then i just heard the sounds with full attention
see this is the problem with most people
the moment they dont understand they think they need not pay attention
what you do not understand needs more attention
than what you understand isn't it
so as i watched teacher after teacher coming in and making noises and noises and noises and going
it became very amusing to me and a huge smile spread on my face
they were not at all amused 
my schooling went like this
very consistent 
because i remember this so well
i dont know if you still have this
you still have those monthly tests and report cards that your parents have to sign
and your you know
your children have to get it to you stuff like that
 yes
 so monthly report cards come i see in the school
some children are strutting around because they are first or second
some are sitting and crying because theyre afraid to go home with their marks card
never once in my entire school life did i ever open and see 
the teachers gave me the card i took and gave it to my father
i thought thiss a transaction between the two of them 
i had nothing to do with this
because i was very consistent
i always got six zeros 
because i always gave an empty paper
if they insisted i put my name on it
otherwise i gave an empty paper as a rule
when the final exam came i wrote something and went to the next class
otherwise all my tests i got zero zero zero zero
because
million things you know
i have a billion questions in my mind about everything
there is nobody around who is capable of answering these questions
but theyre trying to stuff something else into you
which im not interested in
so school went like this
thiss about eight years ago this school
where i studied nearly forty  fortyfive years ago
they came to invite me for their one hundred and twentyfifth anniversary of the school 
so the trustees 
the third generation of trustees  came to invite me
they said you must come
i said see i was not just a not good student 
i was not even a student why me you know
you call the brilliant students of your school
why me
they said  you know our school has produced union ministers
our school has produced cricketing stars
our school has produced film stars
you are the only mystic you must come 
i said okay 
so i went there to speak and 
and i went and stood up in the quadrangle looked around 
the same oppressive buildings 
then i suddenly remembered this classroom
i was about thirteen years of age
one afternoon
the teacher is trying to get a response for some question hes asked
i hear the sounds but i dont hear the words
after some time i dont even hear the sounds
i dont even see their forms
i just see all kinds of things
i know their past present and future
but i dont know what hes saying 
i know his entire life better than him
but i dont know what he is saying
and thirtyfive forty minutes
he desperately tried to get a response from me
but those days i am made like this 
sometimes three days four days i dont utter a word
not because i am in silence or something
when you dont know anything what do you say
this i do not know anything has grown to such a size
it's like you know
my mind is billions of questions simply
i have a question mark about everything in the universe
and not a single answer 
so then after thirtyfive forty minutes he got so frustrated
he came and held me by the shoulders shook me violently like this 
and he said
you must either be the divine or the devil
i think you are the latter
i did not feel abused by this or insulted by this
till then my problem was 
what is this
what is that
what is that
what is that
what is that
one thing was clear to me  this  is me
suddenly this guy confused me about this also 
suddenly i looked like this  
what am i
am i divine
am i devil
what the hell am i 
he just confused me for the first time
i thought this was clear 
so i tried to stare at myself
it didnt work
so i closed my eyes initially minutes to hours it went on
one day i closed my eyes and sat
i thought i sat there for twentyfive thirty minutes
when i opened my eyes
theres a huge crowd around me
india being what it is therere garlands around me around my neck
people are pulling my legs 
they want to know we
somebody wants to know about his business
somebody wants to know when his daughters will get married 
i said
what the hell
where did you all come from
they said youve been sitting here for thirteen days
in my experience it was only twentyfive thirty minutes
when i tried to open my legs my knees were stuck
it took almost an hourandahalf
putting hot water
massage
everything to get my legs straightened out
otherwise even i wouldnt have believed it but thirteen days had passed
in my experience it just felt like twentyfive thirty minutes
and suddenly what is inside what is outside everything got mixed up
clearly till then i was very clear this is me thats you all right
i had no issue with that one but this is me and that is you
suddenly i this idea of what is me and what is not me got all mixed up
because what is me was just everywhere
now this looks like a hallucination and thats what i thought
i thought im just losing you know going off my rocker
im just losing my mind
but every cell in my body is bursting with ecstasy
one thing i know is i dont want to lose it
it may be madness but i dont want to lose it
so right now my whole effort with life is to just rub off that madness on you

you should also know the ecstasy of being alive
right now you know the torture of your intellect
you must know the ecstasy of being alive
you are a piece of life
rest is all arrangements
yes or no
why did you make these arrangements
to enhance your life
no no you made these arrangements mainly to enhance this life
you thought with education your life would enhance itself
with money it would enhance itself
with marriage it would enhance itself
with children it would enhance itself
now you started the question you know
this i wanted to come and meditate but my family my children dadada
as if it's a problem
these are accessories that you added to enhance your life
not to put your life down
yes
 yes
 every arrangement that you made is about enhancing this life  isn't it
if this life  could be enhanced from outside
you would have done it
but this is a realization for you that life cannot be enhanced from outside
arrangements will bring convenience and comfort
itll take care of things for us around us
but it cannot enhance
if you want to enhance the life you have to turn inward
if you really care for people who are with you 
your family your children 
the foremost thing that you need to do is
you have to enhance this 
because what is the damn best thing that you can do to people around you
that you are a wonderful human being
there is nothing better you can do to them
if you had a choice either to live or work with joyful and blissful human beings or
work and live with miserable human beings
what is your choice
 blissful
 blissful
i want you to please please please remember
everybody else is looking forward to the same thing 
you think other people want miserable people
no
please just give them that much that youre a joyful human being 
thank you very much
i would like to i would like to once again acknowledge the dharma foundation
for the commendable cause that they have taken up
this will be an important step
for preserving and nurturing the future generations in a certain way
the significance of this is not to spread another new religion
the significance of this 
to create a areligious world
but still deeply spiritual world
this is very important
this is very very important
the divide of religions you see what it is causing
in the past it has done terrible things
still samples of that happening in many parts of the world
what the religious divide can do
dont think you will be or i will be or our children will be immune to this
 anywhere it can flare up believe me anywhere
so this effort is commendable
and in whichever way we can support this
isha foundation and myself we will
put our force behind this
thank you very much for being here
