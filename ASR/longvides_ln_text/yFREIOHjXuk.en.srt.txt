sadhguru chants sanskrit chant jananam sukhadam
 namaskaram
namaskaram to everyone
 my hearty thanks to you and your team
for giving this one of the most honored opportunity 
to be with you and to listen to you
since i have been a seeker since my childhood
and that is what made me a writer a storywriter
and thats what made me screenwriter
and thats what made me a filmmaker
where i observe people
the traditions
the values and changing people
i experience them because since time my childhood
ive been living with them
and whenever i met people
i felt them
i observed them
and i could see the changing people from every decade to decade
in 1940s
the values of our society
and the values today have been so much different
i remember if i talk about cinema or film 
because im a film director
so pardon my expression through cinema only  
in 1940
there was a film called padosi
where they showed this story of two neighbors
and one neighbor found the other neighbor in trouble
his wife was sick
wanted some medicine doctor
this first neighbor went to a dentist
and asked him to pluck his golden teeth
he sold to the jeweler
brought the money and gave it to the neighbors
for the treatment of his wife
then in fifties the films came
when the friends versus friends would the sacrifice for the life
they would save each other film like sangam
then sixties came when there are family relations were explored in human drama
the indian families
and the seventies came
when the violence erupted
when the rich man looked like a thief and dishonest man
and the poor man cried
and amitabh bachchan was born 
and then eighties
somehow mr rajesh khanna with his romance pacified us
and so the cinema went on changing the values
our hero heroines
from radha ganga to gayatri
they became katrina kareena 
and so many names now
so cinema is the reflection of society sadhguruji
so we pick up the stories from them
but there is always a question of mind
i do connect gurus mentor like you from time to time
to send some social matters
to talk something about my subjects
so here i say sri sadhguruji
you are a guru i am a student 
you are a spiritual guide
im a drama writer and a director
you answer so many question sadhguru
but i question every answer as a child
i talk and write about conflicts
you talk and write about the redemptions the solutions
you look at the people as a victim of ignorance
i look the people of actors of the world
i complicate their thoughts with various dimensions
you resolve their thoughts with one dimension by becoming gps
our gps 
i do not know guruji about the finite to infinite
i do not know the measurable to immeasurable
for me beginning is birth end is death and rest is the journey
jo mila voh mila
jo nahin mila uska kya gila 
i do not know a no mans land
a distance from a subconscious to conscious
as said by some one of our writer
im a student
as you were once over also a student
so now you are master a mentor
i would like to know sir
what is a good student
and what is the good guru or a mentor
how would you define a really good student bad student
good guru bad guru 
 you have already claimed the mantle of being a good student 
so i think i am free to claim the mantle of being a good guru

i think its a deal 
now for a good student
a good student will not look for a good guru because 
if youre a good student
you learn from everything
youre not looking for a good guru
even if you meet a very bad one
you will learn a lot from that
how you should not be
that is also important 
 yes
 in a way
this is what happened to me
when my longing came i looked
i met so many people who claimed to be gurus
but the only thing i learnt from them was
how a guru should not be 
and thats not
thats not a small thing to learn
 yes its a very big thing
 its a very big thing
 like as a director
i always tell my technician what not to do
i never tell them what to do 
 so for a good student there is no problem
wherever he goes he will learn
whatever he meets he will learn
a good guru is one
who doesnt teach you anything
but makes you so thirsty you cant help learning
if people come to me thirsty i dont give them water
i put salt in their mouth 
they get so thirsty they got to find it
because if you show them something
which is not yet in their experience
the only choice that somebody has is
either to believe what you say
or disbelieve what you say
if you believe you do not get any closer to reality
if you disbelieve you will not get any closer to reality
it is just that if you believe me
you will have a positive story to tell
if you disbelieve me
you will have a negative story to tell
but you will not be an inch closer to reality
above all i think
putting people into this kind of a dilemma
either to believe or disbelieve whatever i say or do
i think its obscene
you should not put people into such a situation
so my work is mainly
you are a seeker but not intense enough
so my work is to make you so intense
that it cannot be denied to you
because truth is not hiding you are hiding from it
truth is not hiding
truth is obvious everywhere in the universe
you are hiding from it because
the intensity of seeking has not happened
if seeking becomes intense enough
knowing is not far away
because what youre seeking is not sitting on mount everest
its within you
so how long does it take
what is within you if it takes a lifetime
of course youre on a con job isnt it 
yes or no
it was sitting on mount everest
you could not climb thats understandable
maybe you dont have the legs and the lungs to get to the top of the mountain
but what is within you if you dont find
obviously youre on a con job or no
so to get you out of this deception  is all my work is
my work is not to dispense truth
who am i to do that 
 thiss so true so true
to be on the lighter note being a film man
which is your favorite hindi film 
 oh
 they expect something from me like this 
 oh
 to be on lighter note
 its been a very long time since i saw one
just recently
i think on the airline i saw one
this is about something in the
in a bihari mountain
i think manjhi something
 manjhi
 thats a good movie 
 yes sir 
and manjhi copied his getup also i think
 i think it was very well done
 yes
i think something like that
and furthermore lighter guru 
which is that screen heroine you fell in love in your 
 im sorry
 which is that heroine
film heroine
 film heroine
  you fell in love in your younger age
 me oh no
 now you love human being
 no
they were enough girls around in my town 
i didnt have to look to mumbai 
 now lets come to his sphere now please 
is that guruji has been talking very fondly about his chamundi hills
and im fortunate enough to have visited chamundi hills
and i shot one of my film called krodhi on chamundi hills
 oh really 
 yes sir
so im very fond of mysore locations and all of those
i made pardes and all that
so i remember i was making film called krodhi in 1978
and there was a scene i shot
because i thought that was the right location for this scene
can i explain you one minute the scene part of it
 mhmm 
 it was a dharmendra and pran scene
that one criminal has entered into the team of saints in disguise
the guruji of that team accept him as
 therere lot of saints who dont need any help from outside 
 so there was a scene
when the criminal asked guru
dont teach me about this god and destiny  and all this
i know it all he said that
i wrote the i wrote dialogues
he says
there must be a very smart and very shrewd guy 1000 years back
who created these two worlds called god
and the other world called fate
he created world god because he wanted his children to follow what he said
what he wants them to believe
so he made them a fear of god
and fate he created the world
because when he child fails in following all the principles laid down by him
he says it is your destiny
it is your bhagya 
so i know it all
and this was a question he put it to guru
and guru answered him that
there was one shila in chamundi hill we created
and there was some writings on the stones
he says look at it  referring to hindi phrase 
devotion is nothing but a power
god is nothing but a man who is great
love is nothing but bliss that you and me have to find in one another
you have got a wisdom
but there is a layer on you of the worldly pollution
so you are a man of intellect
but you do not realize the importance of it
so this is why i remember chamundi hills 
because i wrote this scene there while sitting on the stone
 oh hope not the same rock as me 
 so i thought that is how you become sadhguru
because you belong to chamundi hill 
thank you sir
now my short questions in my mind since my childhood is
what is the difference between a rich man and a wealthy man
whos really rich man
 ahh one who has the new currency is a rich man 
 so
you mean to say the man with the old currency has gone poor 
poorer
 see unfortunately we have brought the world to a place where
the words like rich or wealth
have become purely economic descriptions
there was a time when people would talk about wealth of knowledge or
wealth of wisdom
thats gone
today if you say wealthy
people will only understand it as an economic wealth
because in many ways today
society is driven by economics
there was a time  when we were overly influenced by the british
at least we would discuss the weather 
of course mumbai weather
theres nothing much to discuss 
but today
all conversations are around economy
everywhere in the world
everybody is behaving like an economist these days
because it is the economic engine
which is driving peoples minds
it is the economic engine
which is determining the nature of choices that we make in the world
it is the economic opportunities which determine
what what kind of education people go through
people are not studying what they want to know
people are studying that which will fetch them the maximum money
yes or no
 so maybe a few are still marrying for love 
everything has become economic
in united states a whole lot of people
before marriage theyre signing a contract
in case we divorce whats the deal 
how can two people become one when this calculation is on
but the even the idea of becoming one has been given up
its always two
the idea and the dream of two people becoming one has been completely given up
because when economic calculation comes
you become exclusive
you cant be inclusive
so economics are ruling us in every way
so when you say richness
when you say wealth
were only talking about money
not just richness and wealth
if you say hes a big man in the town
it doesnt mean that he has a big brain
it doesnt mean that he has a big heart
it means he has a big pocket
nothing else
this is a very poor way to exist
when we do this 
the ladies must know this 
when economics become the main crux of everything that we do
the feminine will vanish from the world
or feminine will be subjugated
if women have to succeed
they have to become like men
there is no other way
masculine will be everything
that means world will become utilitarian
therell be no aesthetic
therell be no beauty
therell be no gentleness
everything will be a calculation 
what is useful
what is not useful
what do i get
what do you get
there will be no home
there will be only a marketplace everywhere
in the marketplace
the rules of the marketplace are like this 
if i give less and take more that means im smart
yes or no
if you buy
you go to the share market you buy for less and sell it for more
that is smart
but life doesnt work like that
life becomes beautiful
only when youre willing to give it all
and you dont care what you get 
unfortunately economics means
an organized approach to survival
now weve made survival
when we were in the caves survival was a big issue
we organized civilization with so much effort
because we thought we could leave survival behind
and focus on higher dimensions of life
but once again we have brought ourselves to a place
or bringing ourselves to a place
where survival is supreme
nothing else matters now
only thing is
weve raised the bar of survival in such a way
that it doesnt matter what you have
youre still trying to survive
affluent nations in the world
the western countries where
almost every citizen has everything that is needed
theyre still fighting for survival 
fighting for survival like nobody else 
i keep asking the american people
you guys all the time talking about freedom
where is freedom in your life
because even if the most significant dimension appears in your life
you cant take a turn
i keep joking with them 
you know some time ago 2000 years ago
jesus came and said come follow me
a few people followed him
but today
if your jesus comes back and says come follow me
where can you follow him
you have a thirtyfiveyear mortgage on your house 
you have still a student loan at the age of fortyfive
you have a car loan you have insurance
you have this
youre not going to follow
you got a bank to go to 
youre not going to follow anything
it doesnt matter even if a divine entity arrives
you cannot change the direction of your life
this is not freedom
freedom means you should be able to change and alter your life
according to the opportunities that come isnt it
if something truly significant comes
you should be able to turn around and do something else
because we have enshrined economics as the highest value
all these things are gone
everything is about money 
and wealth means just money again
most of the wealth that we have today in the world
is just made up in peoples minds
in 2008
when recession was setting in the western countries
i happened to be at davos at the economic forum
at that year
india was running a campaign in switzerland
the campaign was
india everywhere
all the american and european business leaders were all looking very depressed because
recession was coming
that means they had a few billion dollars less than what they had 
and they were all very depressed
so depressed means you
very touchy and angry with everything
indian people were rubbing it in their face 
i get down in switzerland
huge hoardings india everywhere
on the buses india everywhere
inside the train india everywhere
so it was irritating everybody 
so they asked me to handle a session called 
recession and depression 
i said recession is bad enough
depression is worse
all of you have always been complaining you dont have enough free time
this is the time to walk on the beach 
what are you complaining about
what is it that were complaining about
so there was a chinese bureaucrat
see the way we have structured the economic engine is such
it is like that panchatantra story
where a monkey is sitting on the wrong end of the branch
and chopping the branch
if it succeeds it will fall
thats how we are right now
so i said
see the way you have s structured this is
if we succeed we shall fail
thats how we are right now because
if you fail you will be depressed
if we succeed the world will be damned
yes
the way were going
so i said
its better youre depressed
because  if your ambitions are fulfilled
therell be no planet left
thats where were going
so this chinese bureaucrat did a wonderful thing
he
there was a big mirror
he put one chair and he said
see there are two chairs 
one chair here one chair in the mirror
they all said yes
then he covered up the mirror and he said
see now theres only one chair
they said yes
then he said
always there was only one chair 
you made it up with a mirror that there are two chairs
the wealth on the planet is not gone anywhere
it is just distributing itself a little bit
every time it slips out of your hands
and goes to somebody you will get depressed
he was saying its moving to china 
 thank you thank you
thank you for sharing the chair also with us 
 here there are two 
 two chairs
thank you very much for saving two chairs
now the other question comes in my mind sir
about the education to children
there is a slogan going on in our country 
right to educate
right to education
and i always feel that more than right to education
there has to be a right kind of education
because educating cat cat is a bat
its not a right education
right kind of educations is more important
thats what i feel and i say
where do we lack
the whole process of education for the so many years
see rather century or eighty years
that we have not been living with the intellectual power till now
we face that
i say india is not intellect
is economically poor
india is intellectually poor at the moment
because there has been a big gap of the whole process of education
the right kind of educations to all of our children
what is your take on it sadhguru
 see india is not definitely not poor on intellect
i would say
 you are one
we are thousands
 no 
i speak to all kinds of people around the world 
business leaders
academics
scientists
but still i would say
 when i say it means ignorance
 no at random
if you pick up hundred people from the street just like that
either in mumbai
or chennai
or bangalore
i would say they are way smarter than
most people that you can pick up anywhere in the world 
only
hey you shouldnt clap for yourself like this 
i should have left out mumbai 
it is just that we do not have an organization
for this intellect to find expression
because there is no necessary structures to find expression
each person operates
this is one thing about india
everybody thinks hes a genius 
 thats our education 
 and you will see
everybody is an expert on everything
its like
if you go to a local tea shop
he will tell you how virat kohlis strokes are not perfect 
how he should do like this like that
he will say how narendra modi does not know
how to be a prime minister 
what he should do
 we face every time
a paanwala tells me how to make a story 
 he knows everything in the world
but its just that he cant make good tea 
its just one little lacuna
otherwise everything else hes an expert 
we have this as a little bit of an issue in the country
this is mainly because there is no outlet
for this enormous intellect that country has
there is no structures for people to find expression to that
you just see
take indian people and put them anywhere
theyre just on the tops
 survivors
 its not about surviving theyre thriving 
because once they find proper structures and they understand the structure
you cant stop them
because there is a necessary intellect
this is a consequence of a very huge history
a cultural history that we have
today there are experiments to show
like for example if you
let us say you put the smell of this flower on some food substance
and keep it in front of a rat
or a mouse
and when it goes and touches it
itll get an electric shock
if you do this a few times
next seven generations
those rats will not go towards that smell
all of them understand
this is their learning
so similarly within the human being
a lot that was done in the past
which is which we call as samskara
that means intrinsic learning that we have
is still paying off
or in other words we still surviving on old food
it is time that this generation gets the right stuff
but thats not happened yet
because our education systems
and every system that we had
has been disrupted badly in a systematic way
because weve been an occupied nation for nearly a 1000 years
some came and just ravaged everything
others came and systematically destroyed everything
and they created an education system
which was mainly towards obedience
and clerical kind of work to serve
her majestys service
in 1947 when we got our independence
we should have seriously thought about
what kind of education does india need
we must understand this 
without any infrastructure
literally without infrastructure
without any kind of education
our farmers are producing food for 125 billion people 
this is knowledge
why is this not knowledge im asking
why is this not knowledge
why is this not competence i 
i was talking to a group of ceos
i was just telling them
see ill give you ten acres of very fertile land
you do one thing
ill give you a couple of two different crops
you take out the harvest let me see
all of you are mba mba whatever
you take out a crop let me see
itll freak the hell out of you im telling you
its not easy
ive personally farmed i know what it takes
it is
the more educated you are the more difficult it becomes  
really
because it takes a very a very a close sense of involvement
with what youre doing
and from this
from ploughing the land to the seed to taking the crop out
it is not a easy process
but our farmers are just doing it like that
as if its just part of their life
something that they just inherited
this is a nation with over 12000 years of agricultural history
the only land like that on the planet
in southern india
theyre farming the same land for over 12000 years
there are certain records which show this
so there is knowledge like this on various levels
but we have tried to push everything aside
and reinvent the wheel
once again we want to learn abc
and do it like this
so there is a disruption in the intrinsic learning that we have
and the school learning that is coming to us
im saying just read a book
however educated you may be
read a book and make one good sambar let me see 
it wont come
 yeah thats exactly question is yeah
 because we are thinking only what is written in the book
a  b  c is only knowledge
why is not making a wonderful sambar knowledge
why is not growing a crop knowledge
why is not making a pot knowledge
we have very constipated sense of what is knowledge 
because
 the school system
 because this has come from elsewhere
some indian student in oxford 
i was just
not even a month
three weeks ago i was speaking at the oxford union in oxford university 
one of the indian students has filed a court petition
that he should be compensated for the boring classes
that theyre teaching in oxford university 
i was very happy 
thats why i never went 
thats why i never went to the university 
 that amazes me
that is why the school system the textbook
the six answers to the exam
six questions in the exam
after studying whole year
it really amazes me
that is why i always feel
what not the internal enlightenment to the children
 see the problem is
why were talking about right to education is
we have
for example  i dont know the exact number all over the country 
in tamil nadu itself
we have 96 million children in the government schools alone okay
96 million children
when you have such vast numbers
then you have to do something
what you do for the mass is never the best
but what to do
you have to include everybody
so some rudimentary sense of education is happening
because at least they must learn to
if you dont know this
seventies and eighties the objective was
everybody should know how to write their name
a campaign was
literacy means you must know how to write your name
this is all
that is they were trying to move them
from thumb imprint to something written
it did not change life in any way
but it was a forward movement in a sense
but we must know this
when the british came around twohundredandseventy to threehundred years ago
there was not a single illiterate person in this country
they were amazed because
there were no schoolrooms anywhere
there was no school infrastructure
but there was no illiterate
everybody could read and write
 vidhwan everybody was vidhwan
 so they wondered how does this happen
then they realized the system is so organic
that it is simply happening from within
so the first thing they decided was
we must destroy this education system
because if you educate them like this
they will never become english
see im the only indian left in this hall 
so this system of education that we have inherited
from those who occupied this nation
see we must understand this 
you never take advice from your enemy isnt it
if you have some sense im saying 
so  when they leave your country and go
first things to overhaul is your political system
your education system
your administrative system
these are things must be overhauled immediately
because they were created for a certain purpose
for example even today  the terminology were using im saying 
the district administrators in many states including tamil nadu are referred to as collectors
in the british time they were just tax collectors
their only administration was to collect tax
and take it back home
even today our administrators are called collectors
what are they supposed to collect from us 
im saying we didnt change anything
we we were just lazy
we were just happy that weve become free
but freedom is a terrible thing
if you do not understand the responsibility of being free
freedom is a terrible thing
if somebody is managing our life it is better
when we are not responsible
only if were truly responsible freedom is a wonderful thing
otherwise freedom is a terrible thing 
 maturity
freedom must come with the maturity thats true guruji
i belong to middle class brought up by middle class family
and most of us are middle class people
what is this middle class 
im doing well
im educated
im graduate
still they call me youre middle class 
and we most of us run the country
 see this is an aspirational thing
when large segments of the country were in extreme poverty
the aspiration was to become middle class
middle class means you have college education
you may not be very rich
but youre college educated you have a job and
you have a regular job
usually government employees were middle class at one time
slowly others joined up
now middle class people are driving mercedes benz  okay
 is it in the terms of the economic development
or the knowledge or the enlightenment
what is 
in which term they are middle class
 oh it was definitely an economic description
and there was a big goofup with this middle class
i think it was in nineties
a certain us firm came which was
i forget the name of the firm
they came to do a market survey for ford motor company
and they came here and they said some hundredmillion
twohundredmillion whatever number of middle class families in india
so ford can go to india
no problem
because it has the largest middle class
so ford came and set up the plant at that time
and they couldnt sell ten cars 
then they found out
a middle class in india is earning 10000 rupees a month
and he can only cycle to his office
no question of he buying a car
it took them a while to understand
everybody have their own idea of middle class 
they thought middle class means
in america middle class means somebody whos earning
somewhere between 60000 i mean 30000 dollars to 100000 dollars is middle class
here at that time
indias middle class is
if they earn approximately 1015000 rupees per month
they were middle class which is just threehundred dollars
so 
everybody has their own idea of middle class
but we can take this to another place
now you are claiming youre middle class 
 because it always i wonder
middle class means naa idhar ke na udhar ke
neither this side nor that side
neither ive an identity whether its poor or rich
they are clear about themselves
i am poor guy he is clear
im a rich guy
the middle class is neither this way nor that way in what terms
that was bothering me but you answered
 aspiring to be rich but havent made it 
 you look at it like that
i am taking all the this golden opportunity to ask you 
the question which bothers me at times
is about the world called democracy
what is democracy
and what should be the relationship between the leaders and the people
the government and the people
and in growing democracy
who gets corrupt first
the leader or the people
thats my question 
 see the in tamil the word for democracy is jananayakam
that means people are the leaders
 by the people for the people of the people
 that means there is no leader and there are no people
people are the leaders
thats what democracy means
unfortunately people have forgotten that they are the leaders
i hear
even today morning or yesterday an evening i was being interviewed
today morning i was being interviewed by a journalist in lucknow
so he said
these politicians
i said there are no politicians
they didnt fall from the sky
theyre just you and me
somebody whos willing to do the dirty job for you
what you think is dirty and you dont want you yourself or your children to get into
somebody got into it for you
yes 
and once you get there
the entire game is such that it just dirties your hands you cant help it
its become like that the system
so in democracy there is no leader and people
its people and people
 but obviously there are leaders and there are people today
 that is because we have allowed it
otherwise every five years you could stand up and become a leader
thats how it should be
we have not kept it mobile enough because
we have this tendency of
giving responsibility to somebody and forget about it
 and forget it for five years
 only when something goes wrong we will scream
otherwise we dont care a damn 
no if you
 when it is essential
 if youre making a movie
or somebody is running a business
not after something goes wrong youll attend to it as a director
you are on it every moment to see it goes right
 yes sir
 so i am saying
once you live in a democracy
you must be an active participant
it is not a spectator sport to sit back and forget about it
and then cry when something goes wrong
im telling you even your home will not run right
if you dont pay enough attention
forget about the nation
yes or no
even your home
your own family will become corrupt
if youre not paying attention to many things
yes or no
 yes
 you dont like it but its true isnt it
if you dont pay  constant attention
even your home will go bad and corrupt
so when this is the thing
such a large nation
if everybody doesnt pay attention to what needs to happen it will go bad
then we cry
we have this problem 
when small things go wrong we have somebody here
when big things go wrong we have somebody there 
this guy 
 is free free 
 he is never responsible for anything 
this has to change 
 yes but we i
 see the most beautiful thing about democracy is
power can change hands without blood flowing
never before its happened in human history
whenever power changes blood will flow
now power can shift from one group of people
to another group
without blood spilling
which is a huge achievement 
 but we as individual need to understand that
i am the part of the democracy
and im equally responsible as my leaders are
 see i think one mistake we have done is
in our education systems in our homes
there is no awareness about this
that there are instruments in a democratic process through which
all of us can participate in some way  on a daily basis if we wish
this has this awareness has not been brought to people
they think if they cast vote once in ten years
because one election theyll miss you know 
then the election day they went to goa 
one they will miss
one they will vote and they think they are very responsible citizens
because they voted once in ten years
thats not how it works you need an active participation
then only democracy will work the way it has to work
right now our idea of leadership is
if we find a good leader we will start worshipping them
a good leader does not need worship
what a leader needs
if somebody is
a competent leader comes at the top what he needs is
he needs many layers of leadership
so that he will find traction to what he wishes to do
but you will see if a good leader comes
he will spin on the spot because there is no traction down the line
either there are worshipping people or those whore busy with their own stuff
so we need to understand
democracy means we have taken the nation into our hands
we need to make it happen
somebody will guide it
somebody will make policies
somebody will take some decisions
but the nation is run by the people
if we dont get it then we will always be just complaining
we will not have a great nation
if we want a great nation
we have to stand up and take charge of this country
taking charge of the country does not mean
usurping power tomorrow morning
no
where we are what roles we have to play
we should be doing our best
people are always talking about politicians being corrupt
but im asking you
if there is no policeman on the street
how many people will stop at the red light
i think about ten percent
im being generous i know 
about ten percent
the rest
if you elect any one of them as a chief minister or the prime minister what do you think they will do
because theyre lawbreakers anyway
i see you know normally i land in coimbatore late in the night
ten oclock eleven oclock one oclock whatever time 
and im driving from the airport
red light i stop
there is one little tvs moped guy whos parked behind me
kee kee he will do 
then i dont go till the green light comes
he comes next to me and says like this  
whats wrong with you
he thinks im a fool all right
 exactly
exactly
  his thing is
no policeman what are you doing here
go
so if you make these people into
if you put these people into positions of power what
people whore on positions of power are on spotlight
so everything that they do is seen
but corruption is allpervading isnt it
within the house
between a girl child and a boy
there is a distinction
this is corruption
between a right hand and left hand
one is superior  one is inferior this is corruption
so corruption is not just up there taking money or whatever
corruption is on all levels isnt it
there is no evenhandedness about life
weve brought this to everything
this has to go means
spiritual process is needed
if i can  share something
i think i must have shared already
ill leave it 
 spiritual process is important
 because an inclusiveness is needed
you must transcend looking at things as superior and inferior
one is higher one is lower
you learn to look at everything
this is one thing that happened to me very early
i realized i dont know anything
so i started paying attention
to just about anything
one thing i discovered with people around me was
they could pay attention
or they would pay attention
only to those things that they thought is important
rest of it
they learned to ignore
i couldnt do this
because i couldnt decide what is important
i found the ant crawling on my
on the floor was far more important to me
by than my father who was asking me to do something at that moment
im saying 
yes it was
it is so for your child also isnt it so
your child is looking at the ant
is he not
does he not think the ant is more important than you at that moment 
yes he does
because its more interesting than you 
it is 
it is the finest piece of mechanics that you can find on the planet
if you could build an automobile like an ant
whoa
it would just go anywhere you know
so i got into this mode of paying attention to just about anything
because it never occurred to me something is more important
something is less important
my father believed that hes a very hes a disciplinarian 
tch so he thought 
so evening seven oclock to nine oclock in the evening
me and my siblings must study something textbook
and he will be sitting there reading some magazine or newspaper
so that we study
ive no issues about all that
if i just open my book
i just open somewhere 
i never had the habit 
even today i dont have the habit 
i always open somewhere
if i read one page
i know the authors mind through and through
so i dont read beyond that 
so i open somewhere and on the page i find a small speck of something
you know
some flaw in the page
if i just look at it
it held my attention
entire two hours i was like this 
looking at the spot
i never read a single word
nor did i look up anywhere
i just got absorbed into this little spot
there was enough in that little spot to keep me engaged for two hours
why im saying this is
this is the biggest mistake were making with life
we are setting this up in our childrens minds 
this is god
this is devil
this is superior
this is inferior
this is mine
this is not mine
in this youre causing corruption
youre bringing corruption to the infant
to recognize one thing as high
one thing as low
one thing as mine
one thing as not mine
here corruption has started
if you make this child that you brought him up like this into a prime minister
of course he will be corrupt
whatever if you
by getting into a position of responsibility and power
it only gets magnified
somebody doesnt just get corrupt the moment they get there
theyve been corrupt all their life
theyve been trained in corruption by their parents
and their society
now it got magnified because the opportunity is magnified
so corruption is not up there
corruption is everywhere
if you are concerned about corruption
just sit at home
and see how many things are there in your life
which you need to iron out
yes or no
 yes
 if you dont take this out
you have no right to complain about corruption
because corruption is in your home
corruption is in your mind
corruption is all around you
it is just that those whore in positions of power
you expect them to be clean
i also do
but i dont believe that will happen
unless down the line also we aspire for that in our lives
because the kind of people we are
thats the kind of leaders we elect isnt it
we have some aspiration to change it
but we are not determined to change it
something that is negative
something that is rotting in a society will not go away
unless were determined to change it
strong determination to change it
otherwise it will just go on
rot is not something that you can simply get rid of
because rot spreads by itself
it is cleanliness which is
which doesnt spread by itself
you have to do the cleaning
but rot spreads by itself
so corruption spreads by itself
if you want to bring cleanliness
you have to strive
first of all bringing it into your life
otherwise its not going to work
well only talk about it
 sadhguru youre a master of knowledge and history mythology everything
and i feel that im a child of ancient india
and i know indian 1000 years back
indian hundred years back
and indian today
 1000 years ago thiss how they looked 
 not to the getup
how i have changed from 1000 to hundred to today
and why i have changed
is it a better
or need to be better
 what is the change youre asking
 yes
whats the change as an indian
how much we have changed
 when we talk about india
1000 means were talking about recent times
 ancient times
 recent
 recent 1000 years yeah
i say 40005000 years
 so india as a culture exists for over 1215000 years
at one time we became a nation with enormous intellect
enormous capabilities
very crucible of science mathematics astronomy
the greatest scientists in the world have acknowledged
modern science could not have taken a single step
without the mathematic that came from india
so there were tremendous minds that we evolved because
we had what is called as samskriti
today we have isha samskriti school which is on these lines
samskriti means 
sam means equanimous and exuberant
kriti means way of doing it
that is getting life to a place where it is exuberant and equanimous
if you keep your life exuberant and equanimous
now this life will be fullfledged life
this is the aspiration of every life
whether it is an earthworm
or a bird
or a tree
all of them are aspiring to become fullfledged life
so is a human being
only thing is we know what is a fullfledged earthworm
we know what is a fullfledged bird
we know what is a fullfledged tree
but we do not know what is a fullfledged human being
no matter what you become
still you feel its not enough
it doesnt matter what you have become
in somebody elses eyes you might have become big
but within you you know this is not enough
because what is human is a limitless possibility
 expansion
 because for every other creature nature has set two lines
between these two lines they live and die
for a human being there is only bottom line
theres no top line
so most human beings are suffering their freedom
if youre suffering your bondage understandable
but if youre suffering your freedom thats a bad thing
but thats what is happening
human problem is
what to do with myself
whatever you do its not enough
whatever you do its not enough
if you had come like any other creature
your survival taken care of everything is fine with you isnt it
eating sleeping reproduction if it happens
you were fulfilled
but that is not the thing with human
when these things are in question they are big
once they happen they are nothing
so this transition what youre talking about
historical movement of human beings in this country
there was a time when we hit a peak
but we became so absorbed in finer aspects of life
what that we did not have fighting men
our biggest strength was
we were placed in a geographical crucible where we were wellprotected
we called this hindustan
not after a religion as people think it is today
or some people think its after a language
no
a land which lies between himalayas and the indu sagara or the indian ocean this is hindu
why we worship these two geographical features is
we knew our wellbeing comes from these two features
the himalayan ranges and the indian ocean protected us
so we could focus on the development of the human being
when every other society was constantly ravaged by external forces
we remained untouched for a long period of time
but when people came
they did not come as invaders
they just came in few hundreds 
hundred twohundred people
they were actually bandits
they wanted to rape loot and run
but then they found
people were so docile
people were deeply involved in spirituality
mathematics
music
astronomy
somebody whos looking at the stars cant fight
someone who is singing music cannot fight 
somebody whos into you know counting numbers
or doing mathematics cannot fight
they found this was such an easy land
bandits became emperors
 they stayed there only
 they stayed back
why run 
they decided to stay back and they became emperors
and these are not people with any administrative skills
they were barbarians
so they ruled that way
so immense suffering happened
but we had an evolved sense of intellect and philosophy and ideology
through which we survived
it doesnt matter how you beat them
they didnt fight back but they survived
they not only survived
they kept their culture
they kept their samskriti
they kept their tradition
to whatever extent they could and survived and survived and survived
after over a 1000 years of invasions and all kinds of rules over us
still this is the only culture on the planet
which still has a flavor of its indigenous origins
everybody else is totally wiped out 
but it has not been easy
it has not been the best of times
what was the greatest economic power on the planet
just threehundred years ago
we became one of the poorest nations in a matter of twohundredandfifty to threehundred years
i think at about twohundredandseventy years
we became the poorest nation
because everything was shipped out
but still were coming back once again
we have an intellect
we need a determined leadership to wake us up a little bit
were little sleepy you know
because for generations
tenfifteen generations
our mothers have taught us never confront a problem on the street
if you see a problem come home 
yes
this is what our mothers have taught us
because this is the mentality of an occupied nation 
dont raise your head
put it down and come home
because if you raise your head you may lose it
but if we want to generate leaders in the nation
we need people who seek problems and confront problems on a daily basis

the moment you seek and confront a problem
half the nation resists
it doesnt matter whats the problem 
see everybody was talking about black money all right 
it was one of the conversations always going on
when they dont have money
they would say somebody else has black money
the money that i have is white
what you have must be black  
this has been the mindset
but when you try to take some action
just look at the voices all over
is it the best action
is it the wrong action
thats not the point
we can debate it endlessly
but the thing is
it is some action in that direction 
 we talk about sanskriti
you said about sanskriti
and i wonder since my childhood
that in my home and other places also
i always find pundits chanting sanskrit mantra
we get married
the mantras are all in sanskrit
whether we understand them or not
 youre not supposed to understand all that 
 that is what i was told
and everywhere
i find mantras and pundits
on all auspicious occasion
or whatever the occasion is
and we respect somewhere
like the back of our mind we respect our language
ancient language sanskrit
but when it comes to our kids to learn sanskrit
we tell them
learn that language which gives you a job
this will not give you a job
and we are very shy
to allow them to learn sanskrit
why it is so sadhguru
 see this is as i said
we have experienced ten twelve almost fifteen generations of abject poverty
so when were in such a state of poverty
our only concern is our children should somehow survive
somehow get one degree
get a job 
this used to be the mantra in sixties and seventies
get a government job somehow
or become a doctor
thats the best thing
your life is made
somebody else gets sick but your life is made 
this is coming from a certain fear
that your children may not survive
if they dont pass this this this examination
they may end up on the street
because thats all the options there were
they
it was not a false fear
if your chi child did not get educated
unless he was super talented with something
most probably hell end up as a street bum
that was a fact
but slowly things have changed
our economic situation has changed dramatically
whether we want to recognize it or not
in seventies how you were living and how you are living today
there is a phenomenal different in the material wealth
so today our children have many more options
we can little go slow on this joboriented education
still there is a large segment of india
which still has to go that way
but we
those whore reasonably well to do
can go little slow on their children
i created three different dimensions of education
one is rural education
which is called isha vidhya
to bring awareness to this
tomorrow were golfing at wellingdon 
to bring awareness to rural education
this education is designed purely to get these children
out of their economic and social pit theyre in
this is
from the age of six theyre learning english language
within one year they become fluent in english language
and they start working on the computers
this english language and computer is their passport out of the village
this is the goal
this is run in a certain way
we have another school called isha home school
this is for the affluent
this is run in a completely different way
with an enormous inclusion of sport art theater
all kinds of music
every kind of thing that you can add to aesthetics to it
the school itself is created in a very aesthetic way
so the children experience a different dimension of life
and these children live in groups of twenty in a household
with a dedicated couple
who are parents for these children for the first five years
and the next five years theyll have another set of parents
they move into a different house
these children grow up with enormous exposure to all kinds of talents
for example now i made their eleventh and twelfth
which is two years into three years
i said in our school its three years
because we have invested so much
on music art dance theater all these things
the moment they come to eleventh standard
many parents go marks mad
suddenly marks marks marks will come
they want to drop the music
they want to drop every other art theyve learnt
so i said three years
so extra this one year
whatever they are good at
they will become much more proficient in that
if they are good musicians they will go into that
if theyre good in theater theyll go into art
were exposing them to leadership management business
variety of things
but your children will get out of the school one year late
i think you can afford it because youre welltodo
you have only one child or maybe two children
its all right
your child gets to work one year later
its perfectly okay
initially everybody thought its crazy
now everybody wants to be there
another dimension of education
here there is no formal education
there are only six things that they learn
they start with yoga
kalari payattu which is the mother of all martial arts
classical music
classical dance
sanskrit language
english language
this is all they study
first four years these six subjects
after four years they will drop any two of them and keep that four
and after another twoandahalf to three years time
theyll drop two more
and the next five years to six years
they will do only two subjects
they will become experts in that
you must come and see these children
you wont believe how they are
they are incredible because this is focused towards building the human body
and the human brain to its fullest
if you want something to perform
first thing is you must build the machine
you must build the machine to a higher level of capability
then only itll perform
right now the biggest problem with the modern world is
we are too goaloriented
we want to enhance our activity without enhancing who we are
this is why everybody is talking about stress
whatever simple jobs theyre doing theyre stressful
because they have enhanced their activity without enhancing themselves
its like you take your maruti 800 on a racetrack
it will fall apart 
its not built for that im saying
its okay to go to your office
if you race it itll itll break up
so similarly if you want to enhance your activity
you dont worry about the activity
if you enhance the human being
he will perform the activity according to his capability
so this is focused on just developing the human being
these children are in another zone altogether
fantastic
i
you wont believe it
i must tell you this
the first batch i was to initiate them about five years ago
when they become fifteen years of age
they stay with us from the age of six to eighteen
when they become fifteen
three years they take brahmacharya
it is threeyear period they must take
and at eighteen they must go off
it is not compulsory beyond that 
till that point because we want them to focus
when i had to initiate them at the age of fifteen
they go for a sixty days of silence okay
total silence  
i have to initiate them
i want to see how the children are doing
about threefour days before the initiation
i go there to see them
30 in the evening
okay
in a day at least six hours
they are sitting with their eyes closed
doing sadhana
and all kinds of sadhana 
at least about eleven to twelve hours of sadhana
in this at least six hours theyre sitting with eyes closed
30 in the morning
the first batch was only fourteen
today its grown into big number
i go there and sit with them
nearly half of them are girls and the rest are boys
i went and sat
i i just looked at these children
they were literally glowing
i sat there and wept
because i was not like this when i was fifteen
i know that very well
these children are literally glowing like lights
theyre just sitting like this
unmoving
i just sat there for over two hours
they didnt move a bit
they just sat like stone
i just bowed down to them and came that
this is fantastic  
they are only fifteen fifteen year old children 
 that is exactly when i said
the right kind of education
this is the right kind of education
 yes but at the same time
as i said we are a huge population
if we want to improve our education
 it has to grow
 if we want to improve our education
if we want to improve nourishment
if we want to improve the traffic situation
if we want to improve anything in this country
we have to reduce our population
there is no other way 
 one very interesting question in my mind ive been facing since my childhood
we are talking
all due respect to the belief of every guru and
 no you dont have to respect my belief
because i dont have any 
 when you are talking about the adiyogi
the great lord shiva
i remember my mother used to go to lord shivas temple
and i used to accompany her
and she would tell me that lord shiva belongs to the three lokas 
dharti
akash
pataal
so my father brought one globe showing the geography of the earth
and i asked my mother
is lord shiva
youre talking about the three worlds 
i turned the globe
i said 
does these americans know lord shiva
so is lord shiva territorial or universal
that still question lies in me 
 lets understand this in the right context
the word shiva 
shiva means that which is not
that which is is physical creation
that which is not is that which is not physical
that which is not where can it be
in india or america 
or on this planet or in another galaxy
where can it be
its everywhere
so there is a dimensionless existence
so we called it appropriately 
shiva that means that which is not
today modern scientists are saying
that nearly ninetynine percent of the cosmos is empty
but not that there is nothing 
there is something but it is not something
because our idea of something is
we should be able to perceive through five senses
see right now
what you can see and what you cannot see is this
you can see my hand because it is stopping light
anything that is not stopping light you dont see isnt it
right now there is air here which youre breathing
which is most vital from your for your existence
but you dont see it
you dont see the air unless you live in delhi 
thats the privilege of being in the capital city 
now if you look up in the sky you see the stars
but stars are a small happening
the real thing is the vast emptiness
so this we referred to as shiva that which is not
today modern scientists are saying
this vast space has a tremendous amount of energy
but it is not any of the energies that are measurable by us
like electromagnetic waves
or weak nuclear energy
or strong nuclear energy
or electrical systems
or microwaves
none of these things
it is none of the measurable energies
but there is no denying it is tremendously powerful
so we said shiva means that which is not
and we said it is in the lap of shiva that creation happens
at the same time
we called adiyogi also the shiva
because he perceived that which is not
you are who you are
people call you a director a film producer why
because you perceived something
if you did not perceive that they would not recognize you as that
so we recognized adiyogi as shiva
because he perceived that which is not
because he perceived that we called him also shiva
then maybe there are any number of people
at least in southern india
almost ninety percent of the males are named after shiva
we call that man also shiva
because we know if he does the right things
he can also realize that he is shiva
we named our dog also shiva
yes
because we know he is also made of the same stuff
but he does not know
but we must remind him by naming him shiva 
well call the dog also shiva shiva no problem
in another country in another religion
they would be very insulted if you named your dog by their gods name
but youll see in the villages
dogs in
only in the cities they have this problem 
all their dogs have english names 
this is because
this pet dog business came from the english people
for us dogs were there on the street
and we never taught of taking dogs and fondling them like this  
only the english were doing it
because they were away from home
and they must have been feeling lonely 
 thats the reason yes
 now you see in india
every socalled middle class family 
all their dogs have english names
so we will call the ultimate reality as shiva
the one who realized that
the adiyogi as shiva
one who did not realize that but has the possibility
well call him shiva
well call the dog also shiva
because he is also made of the same stuff
but he cannot know
but we want him to hear that sound
so every time we call him shiva shiva shiva
we hope that we will evolve one day 
 thank you very much for enlightening us 
about the real meaning of shiva so much
 and for those of you who do not know
now on this twentyfourth of february
we are unveiling a a face of adiyogi
which is hundredandtwelve feet tall
because  adiyogi
adiyogi offered onehundredandtwelve ways
in which a human being can realize his ultimate potential
hundredandtwelve ways to do it
so as a way of honoring him
and also to bring back this dimension
that your wellbeing is not in looking up or looking down
but looking inward
when we looked up in search of our wellbeing
we became hallucinatory
then as modern societies
as science and technology came
we started looking out for our wellbeing
once we started looking out for our wellbeing
in pursuit of human wellbeing
we have ripped the planet apart
true wellbeing will happen to a human being
only when they turn inward
to bring this revolution back into the world
for the next generation of people particularly
we built this iconic face
and a book is also ready now
the idea is to move people inward
not up
not out
in 
in is the only way out 
 sadhguru i
 can we show the image of adiyogi is it possible
 yes
 on the screen
 but i must say
 this is the largest face on the planet
 yes
ive gone through your book
its amazing amazing book and so much enlightenment in it
but the best line which i found was
that you said in your book
your joy your miseries your love your agony your bliss
all lie in your hand
some are suffering their failures
some are suffering their consequences of their success
some are suffering their limitation
and some are suffering their freedom
whats the way out 
 in is the way out 
because all human experience is caused from within us
 its within us
 everything that ever happens to you happens within you
what happens within you must happen your way isnt it
right now we are trying to fix the world to fix this one 
its not going to work like that
if you fix this one 
then we can create a world the way we want it
but right now we think by fixing the world
this is going to be all right
its not gonna happen like that
 great great enlightenment
