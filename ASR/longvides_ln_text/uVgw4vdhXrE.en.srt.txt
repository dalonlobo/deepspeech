sadhguru chants sanskrit chant jananam sukhadam
 good evening
good evening everyone
i said good evening
 good evening
 thats better 
please
 good evening
namaskar
welcome
for me it's a very different experience
we deal with the corporate world on a regular basis
to deal with wisdom
to deal with nobility
to deal with sincerity
is completely different
it's a rare honor
a rare privilege
sadhguruji suswagatham 
 thank you 
 i have never in the past researched
when ive gone into a talk or a conversation
it really is the first time that i was compelled to do so 
compelled by the stature
the profundity
and the intensity of sadhguruji
and then i did something that i havent done in a few years
i actually made notes
just so that i dont make any mistakes
 you can't make a mistake asking questions 
 sadhguruji i have been told
that every man
every woman
every child has come into this world with a mission
and until that mission is complete
he keeps taking rebirth
i dont know whether the concept of rebirth is true or not
but i do believe that everyone is here with a mission
how does one find out
what that mission is
and what does it take to get there
 oh
what i say may not be very pleasant 
what is true may not always be pleasant
what is pleasant need not be true
but why truth is important is
because it works
pleasant things will bring solace to individual people
solace means
youre seeking somebodys help
to handle your psychological drama
truth means
youre interested in the solution not in solace
so
this mission aspect
all the problems on the planet is simply because
everybody has their own mission
and these missions are
creating variety of conflict
if all of us sit here
without any mission
mission means an assumed position of importance and agenda 
individual agenda
if all of us can sit here without any individual agenda
if our hearts beat just as life
not as a man
not as a woman
not as this party or that party
or this religion or that religion
simply as life
all of us will be very
will be able to see very clearly
what is it that is most essential right now in the world
both for the individual and for the larger world
because every one of us have taken up this assumed
missionary positions
in our fervor of our own missions 
very brutal things are being done in the world
people who even believe
i mean mission is always godgiven unfortunately
you can look back on the history of humanity and see
whenever somebody said
god spoke to me
terrible things happened around them
in recent times
a president of a major nation said
god told me
since then over a million people are dead
three countries are ruined
and it has bred something that you cannot contain
probably in the next hundred years
because god spoke to him
so there are too many assumptions in this
there are too many assumptions involved
first of all
to think that i have a godgiven mission
there is an exaggerated sense of importance for the human being
somewhere
there is a ridiculous idea that
human beings are central to the creation
or the cosmos is humancentric
no
tomorrow morning
if this entire solar system evaporates
it will not even be noticed
that is how vast it is 
creation
all of us
including the sun and the moon and all the planets
if we just evaporate tomorrow
it will not even be noticed 
it's such a small speck
this tiny speck which we call as solar system
in that
planet earth is a micro speck
in that micro speck
kolkata is a supermicro speck
in that
you are a big man 
and now everybody has their own godgiven missions 
whatever
the most horrendous things that are happening on the planet right now
in middle east
all these horrendous things are happening
because they firmly believe
theyre doing gods work
let's understand this 
sitting here we may think
oh these are all some cavemen or nut cases from somewhere
no
no
no
theyre doing gods work
they truly believe it
if they did not believe it
they wouldnt pitch their life for it isn't it
any man who pitches his life
for whatever he thinks is right or whatever he believes
you have to at least trust
hes sincere about it 
is he sensible
thats another question
but is he sincere
he is
otherwise he wouldnt pitch his life
because it is in the very intrinsic nature of life
whether youre a man woman or an ant for that matter 
if you try to catch an ant
he will do everything possible to save his life isnt it
he does not think
it's just an ants life let me shed it
no no no
it's very valuable for him
this is the intrinsic nature of life 
that every life values itself for what it is
now because most human beings have done nothing
about experiencing the intrinsic value of life
right now i would say most human beings are not life
theyre a bundle of thoughts
emotions
ideas
opinions
and prejudices
because they have become this
now theyre coming up with another idea 
they have a godgiven mission
there is no mission
life is a phenomena beyond missions
it is bigger than any silly mission we can think about
it is more profound
more organic
and more phenomenal
than anything human mind can ever think about
our missions
local missions we can have
right now you can have a mission 
i dont want a single home in kolkata without electricity 
thiss your local mission it's fine
but this is not a godgiven mission
this is a sensible mission that you come to
because so many people are living in darkness
thats fine
everybody can come up with missions like this
out of your sense
but the moment you have a godgiven mission
youre a danger to the world 
yes 
 is there salvation
and if so what is it
 salvation from what
 salvation from birth and rebirth
 so you believe
you are here many times over 
see
if you want to know something
if you want to know anything
genuinely if you want to know something
hello the people in the upper regions
are you with us
 yes
 oh good
 can you increase the volume a bit
 they want a little more volume
 increase it
 more volume
 yes
 whoever the control sir please can you
is this good
hello
 yes it's good
 okay
see if we are in pursuit of truth
the most important thing is
we dont assume anything
you become a genuine seeker
only when you realize i do not know
those who do not realize
the immensity of i do not know
they will believe something
the moment you believe something
you get identified with it
the moment you get identified with it
your mind is a prejudiced mind
it will only work around that
why is it so difficult
for human beings to say
i dont know
the fact of the matter is you dont know
where the hell you came from
where youre going
what is the nature of your existence 
you dont know isn't it
why can't we say i dont know
is it okay
hello
 yes
 is it all right  
what i know i know
what i do not know i do not know
is it okay
 yes
 but right now the tendency in the world
the training in the world is
whatever you do not know you believe 
belief needs support
belief needs social support
you just believe something
that nobody here endorses
you will start
going looking for forming your own society
which believes what you believe
if you believe something and nobody else believes what you believe
suddenly you look ridiculous isn't it
so youll always gather numbers around you
the moment you gather numbers
well
numbers are useful in a democratic process
but numbers are not useful in seeking
because a crowd cannot seek
only individual intelligence can seek
only the longing within an individual human being is capable of seeking
a crowd cannot seek anything
so in many ways when you get identified with a particular belief system
you have become a crowd
you are no more an individual
if you ask anybody they will say
okay for example reincarnation
theyll say reincarnation 
if i say this is all rubbish
they will say but gita says this
so you have an authority which said it
because krishna said it it must be true
in future
somebody will say sadhguru said it
it doesnt matter who said it
the question is 
do you want authority to be the truth
or do you want the truth to be the authority
if you want the truth to be the authority in your life 
because thats the only thing that works 
then we must come to this much 
we must realize the immensity of i do not know
i do not know
is the basis of all knowing
when you truly truly realize i do not know
wanting to know
longing to know
seeking to know
and the possibility of knowing becomes a living reality
otherwise you believe one thing
i believe one thing
ill form one party
you will form another party
we will pretend we are brothers
when it come well hag hack each other 
yes 
i dont have to say this
youre seeing enough examples right through history right
we will
we will say
we are all brothers
we are wonderful like this
we respect your belief i respect my belief
but when it really comes to the crunch
we will hack each other
not once
thousands of times weve been doing the same thing
won't we ever learn
so what youre asking is not about reincarnation
or in a way
youre asking what happens beyond death
tch some things you know best only by experience 
now
essentially what youre asking is 
what is the nature of my existence
it gets clothed in so many things
just now
some time ago i was in conversation with harsh
he burst car tires
he
what
he took me to middle east
he made me cross pakistan border many things
but fundamentally what youre asking is 
what is the nature of my existence
if you want to know the nature of your existence
you just have to pay attention to this one  right now
tch you said a word which i keep on demolishing wherever i go
you said corporate world
there is no corporate world 
there is just one world 
so the moment you belong to one world
i belong to another world
intergalactic fight will happen 
so we are just in this world
if you pay attention how you have happened
right now when you and me sit here
well
i have my physical presence
you have your physical presence
and everybody else has their physical boundaries 
this is my boundary
that is your boundary
that is somebody elses boundary
this physical body which is defining your boundary right now
how did it happen
in bengal
maybe it's just fish and rice 
what else do you eat hmm
what else
 thats not your diet 
 rasagulla
 yeah maybe
so fish rice and rasagulla in the head 
no im saying youre sweet
so fundamentally
we accumulated this body by ingesting food
what we call as food is just actually a piece of the planet
it's good to get it now
if you experience this now
if this becomes a living reality 
you understand this is just a piece of the planet
little bit of topsoil i picked up
and im walking around
well you can carry your topsoil in style
or in a clumsy manner 
it's up to you
but it is just topsoil
if you dont get it now
one day you will anyway get it from the maggots
yes 
one day when they bury you or burn you
anyway you will get it isn't it
so what you accumulate
whatever you accumulate can be yours at the most for now
but cannot be you isn't it
anything that you accumulate you can claim
is mine
but if you say it is me
it amounts to
even by medical definition
you are psychologically off 
yes thats what it means
suppose i say
im this furniture
people know i have lost it
this is happening every day
food appears in your plate
you say this is my food
you eat it and immediately say
this is me
so if you want to know the nature of your existence
one simple thing you can do is
tonight before you fall asleep
if this is a genuine question
is it a question or is it entertainment
is it a genuine question
it will become a genuine question
when your bones start creaking
and you know mortality starts knocking on your doors
oh am i saying something wrong
do you know all of you are mortal
i am saying do you know
even if youre in the upper regions you will die one day
thats all im asking 
hello
 yes
 is it okay
 yes
 this is not my wish
ill bless you with a long life
but with or without me
youll anyway die
lot of people believe other people die 
no
you and me will die 
you and me will die
not today
we dont want it today
but when it's time we will die
so everything that you have accumulated
will become meaningless on that day
right now if you learn
tonight before you go to bed
if you can sit on your bed
everything that you are not
everything that you have accumulated
for two minutes you keep it aside
and just go to bed
go to sleep
if you sleep with this much awareness every day
one day you may wake up enlightened
yes  
you will know the nature of your existence
because right now if i tell you
sanjiv
the nature of your existence
your atma
you know how atma came
it is a drop of paramatma 
i can tell you many things
but till it becomes a living experience for you
it is just a story isn't it
stories will add color to our life
but will not bring truth and liberation to our life
youre talking about salvation
if the longing for salvation is genuine
then stories are only entertainment
it doesnt matter whether the story came from ancient scripture
or story came from a contemporary guru
it is just entertainment
but there are methods
im 
im not known to be an entertainer
i do brutal things in a pleasant manner 
very brutal things but in a pleasant manner
people like it ultimately because it works 
ultimately all that matters in this life is
what works and what doesnt work isn't it
yes
whether it's in business
in your world and my world 
in every damn world
what works is ultimately matters isn't it
what doesnt work however pretty it is
doesnt jell after sometime
so if we are seeking salvation
if
dont seek salvation
just
instead of waiting for that day
when you will sit on your death bed and wonder
what is this all about
tonight you sit on your bed and wonder
what is this all about
let
you come down to reality
right now youre running away with your psychological drama to such an extent
the existential is completely missing
if you pay attention
you will see
and you will constantly be aware of your mortal nature
that means you know you shall also die
this is not a negative thought
this means your time will get organized in a most sensible manner
when you know youre on a limited leash of time
your time will get organized in a most sensible manner
if youre conscious that you will also die
and it could be any day
okay we are planning for this many years
but nobody here has come with a guarantee card
have you
 no
 so it could be today
if youre conscious of this
do you have time to do anything that doesnt truly matter to you
you will do only what really matters to you
when every human being is doing only what truly truly matters to them
this is a beautiful world
right now theyre doing too much rubbish 
 being a very deep cricket enthusiast
and now somewhat involved with the sport
i see with admiration
the rise and rise and rise of virat kohli 
i see his energy on the field
i see his energy off the field
i see the way hes transforming and rewriting the rules of the game
the t20 format
140 to 160 was par score
hes redefined it
now 190 is a par
 250
 250 240
there is something within him that propels him more than others
there are many people who are talented
there are many people who have this ability
but there are few who realize this ability
what is it that takes one to realize
that he can do a little more
he can inspire more
he can create more
he can create new standards
is there something from within
or is it something from outside
what is it
 i have also been watching virat kohli with interest
because
i have seen every great batsman in the last forty fortyfive years
very few have hit the ball the way hes hitting it
probably the only other person that i can think of is vivian richards 
who used to hit the ball like this
but he did not have the sane
same sense of mission that this boy has 
he just played for fun and you know an island caribbean culture 
and he kind of didnt take it so seriously
or did not go at it with a certain zeal
with which this boy is going
but i think he was the only one who was striking the ball
the way this boy is striking today which is very rare
most people who have watched only cricket on the television
dont understand this probably
it's one of the most dangerous games on the planet
a hard ball is coming at you over hundredandthirty hundredandforty kilometers per hour
and this is the only sport where the ball is pitched
and it swings this way that way
which gives you a fraction of a second to make your decision
how to handle that ball
it's it's a very dangerous game
you must you know therere bowling machines
they may be there in kolkata
yes
the bowling machines are there
young men im telling you
dont try hundredandforty kilometers
at eighty or ninety kilometers
just make
set the bowling machine at ninety kilometers
and stand there and see how the ball comes at you
it's crazy okay
so every ball is different the way it's coming at you
so it needs to be handled
everybody who is there we must understand is very good 
they may look clumsy they may get out for zero
but theyre very good with what theyre doing
but somebody stands out like this
this reminds me of
there was a motorcycle rider who is known as
whose name was kenny roberts 
who won the world championships five times in a row
people couldnt believe it because
you have to win sixteen races across the country to get to the championship
all the machines are prepared by the top companies
and the talent is at the highest level
but winning five in a row was considered unprecedented and impossible
so they asked him
how do you do this
so he said
i go out of control with control 
i understand that very well 
i live every step of my life like that 
always out of control but with control 
this is what everybody is seeking
they want little madness in their life
but they dont want to go insane
but their longing for safety and security
makes them insulate themselves from that little madness
then they wonder
what's happened to my life
it's becoming boring and no good
they try to step out
then they get hit by something
they again build walls around them
this process is going on
so when you take an example like this 
one thing is the zeal
another thing is loving what youre doing
really loving what youre doing
thats what you want to do
this once happened
i was just walking into the chennai airport
and the indian hockey team was leaving for germany for champions trophy that year
a few years ago the indian hockey team came and spent
a week or ten days in the yoga center
and we had helped the previous team
but this was a new team
so when i walked in kps gill  was there
and he saw me and said
sadhguru you must come and speak to the boys
we have a psychologist who is speaking to them right now 
in the airport just before they leave for germany
many of these boys have never  gone out of the country
for the first time theyre going
at that time half the team was from the tribal belt
because they all came off the tata academy
so they
i went there to see what theyre talking
so this psychologist is trying to pep them up
he is telling them
i can't repeat this in hindi
but hes telling them
your parents have brought you up
you have to bring pride to them
one billion people
full bharat is watching you
you cannot disappoint them
these boys  
these are all eighteen nineteenyearold boys from the tribal belt
one billion people their expectations
and their parents honor
theyre just dazed like this  
so they asked me to speak
i said see
i asked them do you guys know how to play hockey
i asked them to bring the sticks and the
i played hockey right through my school and college
so i said
you guys
do you know how to play hockey
they said yes
i said no
you guys dont know how to play hockey
they said no
suddenly they became
no no we know how to play hockey
then if you know how to play hockey
this is all you do
those seventy minutes
the ball must be continuously in the goal
thats your goal
you want the ball to be constantly in the opposite goal
dont try to beat germany and pakistan and somebody and somebody
just put the ball in the goal
you like to do it isn't it
yes we like to do it
said just do that
forget about bharat and your parents and everybody 
for some time
and last
one of these conversations i had in hyderabad
one of the film actors
his final question is
sadhguru all this is okay
but in cricket
how to beat pakistan 
i said
you should not try to beat pakistan
you should just learn to hit the ball
there is no pakistan in the ball all right
you just have to hit the ball
you dont have to beat pakistan
if you try to beat pakistan with your stupid emotions
you will do something stupid
which has been happening continuously
now
i think recently virat kohli came on the television and said
my only problem is i get angry
i want to be like a monk something he said
whatever his own version of being
wanting to calm
i think he needs balance
with the kind of talent he has
if he learns to become balanced
he is going to be a phenomena
hes going to be a
a new cricketing story on the planet
not just one more player
he has the necessary ingredients
i said this when he was seventeen
i saw him playing in singapore
for the under eighteen team or something
he was captaining that team at that time
i saw this boy playing and then only i said
this guy will go far
and then he vanished out of my radar for almost five six years
and then he surfaced suddenly one day in the test 
in the indian team
and now hes going the way hes going
he needs to balance himself
if he learns to be a cool fire
not a fire that burns him up
then he will do things which probably has not been done for a long time
i think we can give him those tools of selftransformation
which will not take away the fire
see there are two ways to fire yourself
if i get angry i can propel myself
this is one way
but all of you know
whenever youre angry it propels you
at the same time
it takes away your sense in many ways
it takes away your capabilities
we can show you scientifically
medically we can show you
how your system is getting poisoned when you are angry
instead of being that way
with sheer pleasantness you can drive yourself
you do not know how to
see there is there
we have been driving internal combustion engines for a long time
which have been smoking and polluting and killing us
in many ways but theyve been propelling us
now we are coming to engines
which has no internal combustion
which smoothly drives
without a noise
without smoke
without nothing
were just coming to that
were just coming of age with automobiles
similarly it's time humanity comes of age that
you learn to propel yourself
in a very pleasant manner
i am also on twenty hours a day
im just fooling around 
why do you need anger and this and that
if out of sense you can drive yourself
it is not necessary you have to drive yourself with anger or hatred
yes
those things give you energy in a certain way
but they take away your competence in many levels
this boy needs tools for selftransformation
i think we should deliver that to him 
i would like to do that to him
because he is a phenomena in waiting
 yes yes
if already not made
i mean he can be a much bigger phenomena
but hes already a phenomena not in the making
 see a oneseason phenomena will be forgotten
 forgotten
 he needs to become a
yes 
 in cricket you deal with lots of celebrities
lots of kids who over a period of time become celebrities
and develop huge egos
and when you see the game from within
you see how large the egos are
and to the outside
the ego doesnt overtake the interests of the team
but sometimes it does
how does one as an owner
draw a line between balancing the ego
and the interest of the team
so if you
if you were to pull up a celebrity
hes not used to it
he sulks 
then your team loses out
if you dont
because of his ego
sometimes wrong decisions are taken
so how does one balance this
 this is not just in cricket
this is everywhere 
 absolutely
 you give somebody to do something
if they do it for three days
they have reached stratosphere  you know
if they do something get little recognition
if five people clap their hands
they will rise
so till they fall they dont realize
this is not the way to play cricket 
up in the air you can't play cricket
you got to be on the ground
so how to deal with it
there are many ways
but the best way is not that we dont deal with it
when we when i say we dont deal with it
they need tools for selftransformation
what has happened with them is just this 
they are still driving themselves
because of the euphoria of the crowds
what is written in the newspaper
what other people are saying about you
or in other words
you have not found anything about yourself 
you are a product of other peoples opinion
everybody is saying youre great
and you start believing youre great
no
you dont have to believe anything
if youre good at something
you just have to keep on seeing how to enhance that
it is
this is the problem with people 
they think
they become ambitious
ambition means youre tweaking your desire
instead of tweaking your competence
youre tweaking your desire
which is just the wrong way to do life
you dont need to be ambitious
you dont need to think i have to score hundred runs
you dont need to think i have to become a champion
you just have to hit the ball thats coming at you right now
thats all you need to do
for this
you of course need training  thats a different aspect
without that you wouldnt have come here
you just need the necessary alertness and presence of mind
to do what you have to do at that moment
instead of that theyve become stars
your reputation will not play
it's only which
your competence which plays 
your reputation cannot play
so by the time they realize this
many of them are flushed down
because there is a younger crop coming up doing things
i think these boys
you know because without other exposure
without generally with education theyre just coming straight into the game
and they fully give themselves to the game
before they know what's happening
theyre quite lost  many of them
not all of them
many have matured with the game
others have gotten lost with the game
if they are given little education about how to handle themselves
i think theyll come out on the tops
 greed
i dont know how to define greed
but i would
in my own silly stupid way i would define greed as
unlimited irrational desire
 no
generally greed is like this 
what i want is need
what you want is greed 
generally thats how it is defined 
greed is a strong word
we dont have to go to this
why
greed is a consequence of a certain unfulfilled state
when i say a consequence of a certain unfulfilled state 
what is a human being longing for every human being
all of you
wherever you are right now
you would like to be little more than what you are right now
isn't it so
hello
 yes
 yes
if that little more happens what
 little more
 little more
if that happens what
 little more
 so it looks like
in installments youre going towards something
how much more would settle you for good
let's look at it right now
why go at it in installments
how much more would settle you
hello
if i make you the king or queen of this solar system 
dont look at me with hope 
ive not known to commit such blunders 
even if you become the king or queen of this solar system
you will not be fulfilled
you will look at the stars
because this is the nature of the human being
there is something within you
always longing to expand in a boundless way
because you have gotten so very identified with your physical form
youre trying to find this boundless way
through physical means
when we say physical
let's understand this 
physicality can exist only because of a defined boundary
if there is no boundary
there is no physicality possible
you can say something is physical
only if it has a defined boundary
otherwise it cannot be physical
so through something which is
physical is the world of boundaries
through the world of boundaries
youre trying to reach towards boundlessness
this is like youre driving your ambassador car i
unfortunately i dont see too many on the kolkata roads anymore
youre driving your ambassador car
but you want to go to the moon
you may go beyond the moon sometimes 
if you try hard
but you will not go to the moon
because to go to the moon you need a different kind of vehicle altogether
so youre seeking boundlessness unconsciously
so youre trying to go towards boundlessness through physical means
when it finds very basic physical expression
you wanting to be more than yourself
we call this sexuality
all youre trying to do is
something that is not you
youre trying to make it a part of yourself for a few moments
if it finds emotional expression
we call this love 
something that is not you
you want to include as a part of yourself
if it finds a mental expression
it gets labeled as greed
ambition
conquest
or simply shopping 
if it finds a conscious expression
we call this yoga
yoga means union
yoga means you successfully erased
the boundaries of your individuality
because the boundaries of your individual nature are essentially your making
when i say it's essentially your making 
right now let us say youre sitting here
unfortunately
somebody that you dont like
your enemy happened to settle down in the chair next to you
or in front of you
you can't stand them
youre sweating sitting there
because this horrible person is sitting next to you
what usha
no no no 
your mind cannot take it
but your body has no issue
what they exhale youre inhaling unconsciously but no problem 
yes 
yes or no
your body has no problem
this life has no problem
only your mind has problem
because your mind recognizes the boundary
your body doesnt recognize the boundary
you sit here and breathe 
what you exhale the trees are inhaling
what the trees exhale youre inhaling
really if you look at it
onehalf of your lungs is hanging out there 
yes
your life is not happening separately
it is happening as a one whole thing
youre just a popup from this planet you know
you have seen those popups on your screen
on your computer screen 
if theyve paid only for two seconds ad
it just pops up for two seconds and pup
in the life of this planet
youre just a twosecond popup
and you will pop out
yes or no
 yes
 so
this popup doesnt understand it's just a popup
it thinks its eternal
its boundaries are eternal
you must get this now 
these boundaries are all made by you
if you really fix the boundary
you can't breathe and you will die right now
it is a transaction which is keeping you alive
so this sense of boundary
is wanting you to expand
because you know only physicality
youre trying to expand physically
if somebody expands faster than you
you say he is greedy
if they
if you are expanding faster than somebody
then you think you are successful 
 what stimulates or motivates a leader
youve got there
a mahendra singh dhoni is there
right at the top
what motivates them to achieve more
 youre essentially asking what drives them
 yes
 if theyre driven by something
they shouldnt be leading anything in my opinion
when you drive
youre not driven
you are driving
then youre a leader
if youre driven by something
then youre also a slave
but you have a bunch of slaves behind you
whether your ambition drives you
or your godgiven mission drives you
or your greed drives you
or whatever drives you
if something is driving you
in my opinion
i wouldnt call that person a leader
nothing drives you
im made like this
i really have no need for action
if i close my eyes and sit here
i can sit here till i fall dead
really
i can simply sit
ive simply no need for action
but all the time im on
people think i have a mission
there is no mission
i see an enormous longing in people around me
i see it's needed
so i do what i can do
people call this all kinds of things
oh sadhguru is twenty hours a day
seven days
how can he do this
he must be having god talking to him every day 
no
this is just this 
if you just pay attention to this 
every human being is capable of knowing this 
the very body that you carry
you created from inside
there is an intelligence here 
there is a competence here 
which is capable of transforming a piece of bread into a complex machine called human mechanism
this  is the most complex piece of technology on the planet
you agree with me
 yes
 those of you whore engrossed with your phones im asking you 
this is the most complex piece of technology
this youre capable of making
with a piece of bread or a mango or a fish or whatever you eat
now if you can tap into this intelligence
even if a drop of this intelligence
which can make bread into body
came into conscious access
suddenly life would become magical
this is what every human being has to do
because the highest form of intelligence is right here
not here  
it's right across
right now were mistaking intellect for intelligence
intellect is like a knife
it cuts through a few things
it helps you with survival
but it doesnt show you the nature of life
it doesnt give you access to life
in fact it chops off everything
if you apply your intellect too much to anything and everything
everything gets chopped up
it's it's a good instrument for dissection
when you want to know something
so 
our
today our science has entirely become dissection
this works okay when youre doing some material stuff
but now you want to know your mother very well
so you dissect her
no
im
please this is not the way
okay
this is not the way
you must keep your instrument of dissection aside
and see how to embrace and include somebody
only then you know them
by dissection you may see their liver kidney spleen
but you won't know that piece of life in any context isn't it
so the problem is just this 
that
we think a leader means he must be boom boom
slogan shouting
fired up
no
i think leadership has to mature into a place
a leader must be someone
who has transcended his own needs
there is nothing driving him
then he will do what is needed
this is what im trying to create with every human being in the world 
that is
youre no more in pursuit of happiness
youre blissed out by your own nature 
when youre not in pursuit of happiness
youre no more a vested interest in the world
you will do what is needed
but when youre in pursuit of happiness 
if i do this i will find happiness
if i do that i will get fulfillment
or if i get this i will get fulfillment 
when youre in such a state
knowingly or unknowingly
youre a vested interest
knowingly or unknowingly
you will cause much harm
people may not realize that right now
generations later people will look back and say
look at the things they did in the past
but if youre joyful and blissful by your own nature
your intelligence will function in a completely different way
you will do just what is needed
another thing is
you are free from the fear of suffering
only and only when youre free of fear of suffering
will you stride fullstride in your life
otherwise
every step is a half a step 
what will happen
what will happen
what will happen
whatever happens this is how i will be 
if this assurance comes to you
then you would explore your life in many many ways
than you are doing right now isn't it
this one thing must happen for every leader
this is the reason why last twenty years weve been focusing on the leadership in the world 
political
business
bureaucratic leadership
all kinds
this is about twelve thirteen years ago
someone very prominent person came to the yoga center
and they went through the inner engineering program
and they said
sadhguru this is fantastic
but what about the nation
so i told them
see i have a clear cut plan
i have listed out 2000 people
im not talking about prime ministers
chief ministers because they come and go
you know the life of a democratic leader may be five years or ten years at the most
some may last a little longer
but generally thats all it is
but there are another set of leaders 
business leaders
bureaucratic leaders
social leaders
who are there for a solid twentyfive  thirtyyear span
in many ways
these are the people
who ultimately are the legs for any political leadership
they are the people who actually deliver the goods
so i said
see i have a list of 2000 people
you get me these 2000 people in the next four years
you will see in the next eight to ten years
you will see a significant transformation in the country
weve been going at it
nearly fourteen fifteen years i think now
i think we have touched about fortytwo to fortythree percent of this leadership
and theyre making a quiet difference 
im here with you for the same purpose 
 but sadhguru tell me one thing
one of my closest friends wife had a very bad back problem
and now she is doing yoga
and it seems she will be able to avoid surgery
and she will get cured hopefully by yoga
how do we take this science
which energizes the body
to the youth of the country
 the youth of any nation has some level of volatility
and some level of confusion
but right now
the youth in india in many ways are at crossroads
they do not know culturally
whether they want to fall this way or that way
usha has successfully you know
straddled the two worlds
look at her how she looks
but shes a rock singer okay 
so others are all struggling how to
you know
they dont know whether to get totally westernized or stay indian
somebody says bharat
somebody says india you know
it's a confusion for the youth
the youth means it is humanity in the making
and terrible things have been happening in the country
in our country so many things are happening
in this
what is happening to children and youth is of great concern
because it seems in the last one year
1700 children
below sixteen years of age committed suicide in this country
when children start committing suicide
we need to understand
were doing something fundamentally wrong
something very fundamentally wrong
when children below sixteen years of age commit suicide in such numbers
we need to understand
with grave concern
that fundamentals are not being handled properly
i heard this number about four months ago
then i told our people
this year for the yoga day
we must touch 10000 schools
we must teach yoga in 10000 schools
people balked
but theyve gotten used to it this these days 
my aspirations
10000 looked like a bi big number four months ago
then i just traveled eight states
and met the chief ministers of every state
but all of them came with such enthusiasm
that today we have made mous 
with these eight states
and the ninth state is coming through now
it is going to cross 30000 schools 
we
we have trained 45600 teachers
who in turn will train three teachers in every school
and this is not a oneday thing
this is
will happen as a part of the school curriculum
just twenty minutes a day
a simple form of what is called as upayoga
upayoga means its subyoga
if you teach yoga
there are certain parameters that you must maintain
because it doesnt matter how innocuous a yogic practice looks
every one of them has a spiritual dimension to it
simply the way you sit
the way you breathe it has
without those dimensions if you teach
it would be irresponsible
so we took this upayoga and
which doesnt have a spiritual side to it
which is purely for their physical and psychological wellbeing
it is of immense need in the country
we are probably touching somewhere around seventeen to eighteen million children
between ten to sixteen years of age
thats the age group we have chosen
but this is still a drop in the ocean
this is not a total solution
this needs to happen on a much larger scale
my commitment is
did all of you brush your teeth today
 yes
 those of you whore not saying anything please 
 yes
 you brushed your teeth today
because the tools for keeping your dental hygiene are with you
suppose it was in the hands of the government
or with an organization
the toothbrush is in my hands
you have to come every day
and i will brush you 
im sure many of you would miss it
because the queue you know
now everybody has the tools of their dental hygiene
similarly
every human being should have the tools of selftransformation in their hands
it should not be in the hands of a guru
or an organization
or some other kind of edifice
that has been built 
every human being must have access to this
with this intent we are doing many things
fortunately
i consider myself
you know like 
i was speaking somewhere
and i said
sadhguru who is the greatest guru in the world
i said of course me  
mike tysons posture
this is me im the greatest guru
they said
whats happened to sadhguru
i said see
when a krishna came
however graceful and fantastic he was
if he spoke the gentle being that he was
if he spoke
maybe fifty people heard him
those behind did not hear
when a gautama the buddha came
he was little more you know
he didnt have the same aesthetic problems as krishna
he was more committed towards his mission 
so maybe he spoke little loudly
hundred people heard
today we have come to a world
where we can sit here and talk to a billion people if we want at once
so when this kind of situation has come
a time has come
where everybody should have access to it
it should not be limited to organizations
gurus
scriptures
this that
every human being
as they know how to keep their mouth clean
they must know how to keep themselves clean
the necessary tools must be made available
our commitment is just to offer the tools
no philosophies
no belief systems
no ideologies
no forming of one more new religion
but every human being should have the tools
and they must know how to use it
today it is possible
never before this was possible
today it is possible 
 very often a public display of simplicity is mistaken  for simplicity itself
and it's regarded as a virtue
how does one actually impress upon people
that it is not a display of simplicity 
that is important
but it is the simplicity of thought
and simplicity of virtue that is more important
 i would depreciate simplicity of thought
i think we need a more sophisticated and complexity of thought
why do we need simplicity of thought
do we want to become earthworms 
i know theyre more ecofriendly  but
thats not the idea of being human
this entire simplicity business has come from very mediocre minds
saints and sages of the past if you look at them
they lived in accordance to the times in which they lived
someone  
i have
whatever i do i do it with a certain involvement and passion
so i drive in a certain way
so one journalist comes to me and asks
yogis always walked across this country
you are driving by yourself
what kind of a yogi are you 
i said
you idiot
thousand years ago
not just yogis
everybody was walking only 
not just yogis
everybody was walking 
so he was also walking
now if i walk and go
you will say
see what a fool he is
if i drive
you will say
see hes driving
will i become more spiritual if i have
if i have a chauffeur driven car
so right now there is this thing
that spirituality is some kind of a disability
because if you say spiritu im spiritual
first thing they will ask you is what are the things you cannot do 
they will not ask you what are the things you can do 
so i took it upon myself
to confuse the hell out of people
nobody can figure what i am
im many things at the same time
i have driven in competitive racing
i have
im a licensed rotary wing pilot
im a licensed diver
im many many things
because spirituality is empowerment
it is not a disability
the reason
why most people have rejected spirituality is
because some people projected the idea
if you dress badly
if you eat badly
and if you live badly
you must be spiritual 
this has to change
this has to change
everybody needs to understand
what you eat
what you wear
where you live is a question of your requirement
and your aesthetic
how you are within yourself is your spirituality
instead of fixing the interiority
youre fixing the paraphernalia you know
youre fixing your clothing
so if you just wear a small piece of cloth around your loins
you will not become spiritual
if that is the like
that is the way you like it
you want to keep your life that simple
it's up to you
but unfortunately
people are impressed by this
no this should go
this has to go
so i think in many ways
in a very controversial way ive set up an example for this  that
you know donna donna karan and me wanted to come out with a
i design clothes
i
everything that i wear is designed by me
and i also design for a few other people 
so i said
she looked at my clothes and said
sadhguru youre the best dressed man in the world
i said no no no
she said yes really ive never seen anybody with your sense of color and texture and stuff
we must design clothes together
i said okay
ill give one week
one week let's design something
but she said i dont know how to design mens clothes
i said what's the problem
i will design womens clothes 
there is more options and more creativity there
well i didnt get the time to do it but hope ill do it someday 
so this idea of simplicity has destroyed many things
at certain times certain people
somebody who lived in the jungle dressed in a certain way
but even they when they came to the city
in those days whatever was formal they wore those things
peoples idea of spirituality or yogis and saints
i think these are yogis who have fallen out of the calendar images
okay 
 were getting on in time
this can go on
but it's time to take questions from the audience
we will take two questions
 please take the microphone
if you raise your hand
the microphone will come to you
yes
 namaskaram sadhguru
speaking of gods and goddesses
 im sorry
 speaking of gods and goddess
kolkata is a place replete with kali and durga maa
celebrating slain of mahishasur
you have also created mahishasur at linga bhairavis feet
what is the connection and spiritual significance of devi slaying the demon
and why under linga bhairavi also thank you
 hey we didnt talk about guts gumption and gods
 we didnt 
 she is bringing us to the gods
 yes
 i want you to mentally gear yourself up for this
i want you to understand this land
this culture is a godless culture
never before ever in this country
have we projected the god any time
we always told you your life is your karma 
that means your life is your making
everything that you are is a consequence of what you do to yourself
either consciously or unconsciously
if you do it consciously
itll turn out the way you want it
if you do it unconsciously
itll turn out some other way
and you think something did it to you
so when we said it's your karma
it meant that you are the maker of your life
but gods and gods and gods
im sorry
goddesses also 
there is a gender issue 
we say that there are thirtythree million gods and goddesses
this thirtythree million happened
when our population was thirtythree million
since then weve gotten little shy of creating gods
because people from outside came without understanding
the science and technology of godmaking
they said you are
you know
multiple gods you are worshipping
thats not how it is
we know there is only one god
everybody made up their gods
some have forgotten but we know
thats a big difference
making up the god does not mean just imagine something
that is how it's happened in variety of cultures
but in this culture we evolved the technology of godmaking
when i say technology of godmaking
i dont know if this word is alive in bengal
but in the south
the deity is also referred to as a yantra
is that there
no
yes or no
 yantra
 is the deity also referred to as a yantra
 well in north india for sure
 it is
 it is
 okay in south it's very much alive
you must understand the word yantra means a machine
or a form that works for you
why do we create machines
why did we come up with a bicycle
we can walk
because we are capable of locomotion
we walked for some time 
it was not good enough
so we came up with a bicycle to enhance our ability to
our locomotive capabilities
we enhanced it further
we made it into a motorcycle
we made it into an airplane
we made it into many many things
all this only because we are capable of locomotion
if we were made like trees
we wouldnt have come up with bicycles
right now because we can speak
we have come up with a microphone
we have come up with a telephone
we have come up with all kinds of phones
because we can see
we came up with a microscope
a telescope and many kinds of scopes
every machine that we have created
is only enhancement of the faculty that we already have
we did not come up with any machine
which does something different from us
it only does the same thing in a better way
we can t see till there  
we have a telescope and we can see very far
we can speak here but you wouldnt hear
so we have a microphone
now we are speaking to the entire hall
so everything
every machine is only an enhancement of our existing faculties
similarly as we have created machines
we created subjective machines
this is what we called as the deities or the murtis
or today being referred to as gods in english language
these are machines which could do something for us that we ourselves cannot do
there are any number of
innumerable examples where people have used their deities or murtis or yantras in ways
which have made them into incredible human beings
one which is right now circulating around the world because of this movie  what 
the man who knew infinity whatever
ramanujam youve heard of 
ramanujam just poured out mathematics
unlearnt
simply poured out
people asked him
where does this come from
he says my goddess she just drops
she just bleeds mathematics
the things that he wrote in early twentieth century
are still being figured today
and in 2010 they realized
some of the formulas that he built are actually describing the black holes 
in early twentieth century
there was no concept of black hole
but he created a mathematical backbone for black holes
which he did not know about
nor did anybody know about
he said
my goddess just pours mathematics for me
so like this
these are subjective tools with which you can open up a certain window into existence
i am a living example
unlettered 
happy being illiterate
the only qualification i have is
with great care i remained uneducated 
yes
no no
you think education is a difficult thing
no
remaining uneducated takes a lot more
because
from the first day youre born
your parents every other adult teachers
pandits priests mullahs
all kinds of people
everybody is busy teaching you something
that has not worked in their life 
yes
if somebody gives you any advice
first look at their face  
are they really more joyful than you 
why im saying this is
if something has worked for somebody
it should have made him into a really exuberant life isn't it
suppose somebody comes and gives you
your neighbor comes and says
i have a special manure for your mango tree
you must look at his mango tree 
how many fruits 
yes or no
before you apply that manure to your mango tree
you must see in his mango tree how many fruits are there
if his mango tree is laden with fruit unlike yours
then yes
you must take his manure
otherwise you should not
all the teachers
including the parents
im asking you between you and your children
who is more joyful
 children
 then who should be a consultant for life 
so these are tools
when i referred to you know
if i
whenever i refer to dhyanalinga as a tool
people get very upset
sadhguru it's more than our life
dont call it a tool
it's such a mundane crude word
then i tell them
you do one thing
you come to the yoga center
ill give you plumbing job
no tools
you can use your hands your teeth whatever you want
three days work without spanners
winch  this that nothing 
everything will be bleeding
on the third day
i will give you a spanner
will you worship the spanner or no 
you do not know the power of the tool
as human beings we are who we are
only because of our ability to create and use tools isn't it
otherwise a colony of ants would dominate us
believe me
we know how to use tools
that is what sets us apart
so we built subjective tools which
today are getting referred to as gods
we appropriately called them as yantras
because these are machines which work for us
so for this we had a certain way to operate a certain machine
how to access this particular machine  
a particular sound pattern
a particular form
a particular process
these processes unfortunately in many places might have gotten distorted
but if a deity is alive
if you know how to use it
it can do incredible things for you
this is not belief system
this is not religion
this is technology
technology of another kind 
 we have a question from ravichandran ashwin on video
can we take that
 okay
is he going to spin me out or what
 hello sadhguru
im basically a very ambitious person in life
anything that i want to do i
i think i should excel in it
and hence what happens is
i get into a lot of conflicts in terms of other people
i generally try and shun people out of my life as much as possible 
when i seek excellence there are always
these obstacles that come in between
but what i want to understand is
the disturbance that this creates as a process it puts in our mind heart
so i would like to handle it much better
and if there is a way that we can sort this disturbance out
i would like to know how
 if you want to excel in something
as i earlier said
you think excellence also is your ambition
ambition means youre tweaking your desire
desire need not be tweaked
your competence need to be tweaked
tweaking the competence
nobody can come in the way
because youre doing something with yourself
when your competence reaches a certain level of excellence
others will stand by and watch anyway
when you spin them out
even the batsman will stand and watch
his wickets fall 
because there is a certain excellence
so excellence is not something that you do with the world 
excellence the is something that you do with yourself
suppose youre managing large situations
teams and organizations
then it involves everybody
when it involves everybody
there is a certain aspect
see the problem is
we are always either looking up to something
or looking down on something
this is something we must understand
this is one thing all of you should do 
that is
dont look up to anything
dont look down on anything
if you just bring this
this is not simple
this is not as simple as it sounds
because the moment you say something is good
you look up to it
the moment you say something is bad
you look down on it
just bring this equanimity in you 
you dont look up to something
you dont look down on something
you look at everything just the way it is
only if you see life just the way it is
can you conduct it to the best of your ability
if you think something is good
it gets exaggerated in a positive way
if you think something is bad
it gets exaggerated in a negative way
the moment you exaggerate something in your mind
youre not seeing things the way they are
once you dont see things the way they are
excellence will be of another world
it will you will never touch it
so people are not in the way of your excellence
nobody is
it is just that you are treating excellence as an ambition
no
excellence is selftransformation 
 there is a question from the rising pune super giants cricket team page
 this is a fixed question 
 it's
well it's not a fixed question
but it's a
 all right 
 it's a its a preset question
 all right
what's the question
 i think it's
 oh theyre coming on the video
okay
 it's coming
 who is asking the question
the coach
or the captain
or the bench
 no
 what happened
 lokanetraji says no
can we take one question from the audience
 anybody please take the microphone
 sadhguru i have a question
 where is
where are you
 i am here sadhguru
this side
 where is here
where
which is this side
 this side 
im here sadhguru
 okay
 first of all thank you for making it to kolkata
we expect you more often in kolkata
sadhguru for centuries
we have thought education is a solution knowing will be doing
now today we are living in a world where every information
every knowledge every profound thing is available at the click of a mouse
but yet problems have only got compounded
 oh youre still on the mouse
youre not on the phone
hmm
 pardon
 youre still on the mouse 
thats an ancient tool 
youre not on your phone
 yeah so all these years we have believed that
you know if we know things if we know what is right and you know
life will get transformed
today the problem that
i personally face and i feel
feel so many people
i have done shambhavi
now the question is
every morning when i  rise
it becomes a some kind of a challenge you know
whether i do it or i dont do it
execution in our lives has become a challenge
so what is even say
youre touching the 30000 schools and the children
what will ensure that what the tools are
whatever tools of transformation they learn
that gets followed up in their life
how
how does the execution part gets taken care of
thats my question
  now with the children
with the schoolchildren it's
we are not teaching it to the children
we are teaching it to the teachers
and it is going to become a part of their curriculum
so they will do it anyway
at least the five days in the school it will happen
the other two days we dont know
we are trying to involve the parents
if that happens itll happen at home also
about you every day struggling whether to do shambhavi or not
i want you to understand
i invested my life and my time
and my energy to make this happen for you
and now if youre not doing it
youre not just wasting your life
youre trying to waste my life
i dont i take that very seriously 
and thats not a good karma for you 
so tomorrow morning the thing is just this 
if those first six months we told you that you set it up 
this discipline 
if you had done it by now
shambhavi would be a process thatll bliss you out every morning
if something becomes a very sweet experience
nobody has to tell you to do it
it is only initially till you realize the nature of what it is
you need some  force
so thats why we asked you to take a commitment
im sure you didnt keep it up
but now that you asked this question now
next six months you must do it okay
otherwise im coming 
there are millions of people for whom they are looking forward to their shambhavi
every day
because that is the best twentyone minutes of their life
it should become like that
if something becomes beautiful
then nobody has to tell you
you must do it
anyway you will do it
it will become lot more than
anything that you have known
if you give yourself to it
there are millions of people
if they close their eyes in the morning
tears of ecstasy are coming
do they need to determine themselves they must do it
theyll anyway do it
 friends
i think in the interest of the schedule
we must call this to an end
 last question
one
one
 im okay its 
 okay
 hello hello
 somebody got the microphone
 pranam sadhguru
 can we take it from the lady there then
 one question
 important question for me please
knowing who i am is not enough
because if you are
 where are you
where are you
 if you
 hello 
where are you
 sadhguru here
 here means where 
 balcony
 oh
 i think
 balcony here
ive raised my hand
yeah
what my question is 
knowing oneself not intellectually but truly
the i amness beingness is still not enough
because the mind still traps you
and enslaves you
 no you must ask the question
 though the frequency
 you must ask the question and leave it
if you ask the question and also give your own answer
what to do 
 no no what im saying is what to do
 what to do about what 
 no what im saying is even if one knows oneself
as the beingness and i amness not intellectually but truly
still it is not enough
because still the mind traps you
though the frequency becomes less
one more another thing 
you claim to stop people from getting enlightened
because they may die
it is so ordinary and obvious thing to know oneself
then how how can one die
and how can one stop another person from getting enlightened
thank you sadhguru 
 i dont need to stop you  
most people are doing a good job with themselves
i dont have to stop them
it's only a few whose
you must understand this
the problem is
too many books are printed telling you all these things 
beingness and thisness and thatness 
too much jargon
nothing happens like this
you must understand this 
if in some way
any one aspect
if something is happening which is genuine 
because your mind can deceive you in a million different ways 
if something genuine is happening
at least one aspect of your physicality you will transcend
that is the test for you
tonight just like that
without drinking a mug of coffee or tea
just like that
simply without doing anything no party
no nothing
just sit up and see if you can just stay awake
just like that the entire night
im saying if something has happened within you
at least one aspect of your physicality would be transcended
it's not that forever you need not sleep
just try one night if it's possible
so just one
or try not going to the bathroom for twenty four hours 
anything 
transcend something let me see
because if you have hit something beyond physical nature
this is a clear thing that happens to you
many things that you thought were impossible to go beyond
suddenly they are behind you
check it out 
 well friends
i think all good things must end as must this
for me
it's been not only a privilege but a blessing
i think
there is something to be learnt from every word that sadhguru says
i think all of us are privileged
happy
and blessed
thank you sadhguruji 
 i would i would like to
i would like to use this opportunity to just say this  that
it is it is wonderful and truly heartening to see
that across the world
today the business leadership is beginning to look at the inner dimension
not entirely yet
but theyre beginning to all over
every business school is interested 
they
theyre trying to hire me as their professors
as a professor for a week
ten days in a year which im not able to do
but every top business school wants a spiritual element
which is a very good sign
because what spiritual process means is just this 
when your identification shifts beyond your physicality
when your experience of life transcends physicality
it is spiritual
spiritual  it's the most malign word i know
spirituality doesnt mean looking up looking down
it's about turning inward
you have touched something which is beyond physicality
the significance of this is just this 
if you touch something beyond physical nature
that means you have touched something which is boundless in nature
youve
you have left the world of boundaries behind you
thats what it means
those who are enabled
in terms of leadership 
either political
bureaucratic
business whatever 
in whichever form if youre in some state of leadership
one thing that needs to happen is
you must evolve yourself beyond the world of boundaries
if you live in the world of boundaries
and get hugely empowered
youre bound to create some kind of a conflict
which is destructive in nature
particularly the business leadership today
because there was a time
when the religious leadership on the planet
was the most influential leadership
but then the military machines on the world
in the world built up
then the military leaders became the most influential leaders
but in the last hundred years
the democratically elected leaders have become most powerful
but a time is coming
in the next fifteen to twentyfive years 
you will see the economic or the business leaders
will rule the world in many ways
but the business leaders
unfortunately have a tag around their neck
saying that they are vested interests
they are here just to make money
it is a time
it is a wonderful happening that
a whole lot of business leaders are looking towards spirituality
this means
spirituality does not mean going to the temple
going to heaven
no
it means moving from a world
or a dimension of boundaries
to a dimension of boundlessness
once youre empowered
it is important that you go beyond your boundaries
your boundaries should not rule you
and in the next twentyfive years
you will see across the world
the business leadership will determine
what happens in this world
today itself it is true
the success of a nation is not determined by the success of the military forces
or even the political process
it is the success of the businesses of a nation
which determines the success of the nation
and the wellbeing of the nation
when such a responsibility has come
i
it is my aspiration to move every business leader
from personal ambition to a larger vision
which brings wellbeing to everyone
thank you very much for sanjiv
for being here on this day 
 thank you
