 the business of introducing sadhguru jaggi vasudev
whos been described in many different ways in my profession
by people from my profession
weve called you a maverick 
weve called you a monk on a motorcycle
weve called you a glamorous flamboyant guru
but for your devotees you are simply sadhguru
and yet sadhguru
at a time when
faith seems to be in collision with
so many other questions that come up as a matter of individual liberty
i think this will make for a very interesting and important conversation for our times
so i would like to thank you for being part of this conversation
let me start with the spiritual
and i hope what you say today is also addressed to the skeptics
i count myself among a skeptic
who if told that another human being possesses some sort of godly power
i would perhaps as the first instinct not believe it
but what i find interesting about what youve s
some of your sayings as captured by arundhati subramaniam in this book
is that youre actually saying that
what we experience beyond our five senses
anything that we experience beyond the five senses can be called god
can be called power or can be called yourself
so if god doesnt necessarily exist
why do we need gurus
why do we need sadhguru 
 do you drive in delhi
 do i drive
 mhmm 
 unlike you 
i have a fear of wheels 
 so if you drive in an unknown terrain
 yes
 you use these days a gps
 yes
 usually a strange woman will tell you
turn right you turn right
she says turn left  you turn left
she says make a uturn you make a uturn 
why
simply because you are
youre not familiar with the terrain
when you are in an unfamiliar terrain
it is sensible to take instructions 
 so are you
are you saying gurus are the new gps 
 not new not new
long time ago weve been 
for a very long time way before the gps came 
gps means what  guru positioning system 
 but you know i have to say that while i dont drive
ive often sat in the car and heard that girls voice on google maps
and often google maps
 you can actually you can actually
 does not does not adv
does not give you the right advice
 you can change it to a mans voice if you wish
 okay 
this beginning of this conversation perhaps underlines that you are atypical
you are atypical of what we imagine gurus to be
we expect people who dont crack jokes
we expect people who dont have a zest for life
somehow all of our spirituality has traditionally been centered around giving up
around abstinence of some kind
around abstaining from pleasures
from denying creature comforts
why do you believe that the material can coexist with the spiritual
 its its not that i believe
its only because you have a body which is your physicality
you have a life within
if you did not have a body
if youre disembodied
im not going to talk to you 
because with disembodied beings you dont have conversations okay
i know people
 people do talk to ghosts
 people are trying to do that these days 
because theyre not on talking terms with the living 
they choose the dead 
because you can make the dead speak whatever you want
the living will speak what they want its a big problem 
its a very serious problem in a conversation
because i will say what i want to say
if i was dead you can make me say whatever you want to say
 but can an
 because you can do both sides of the conversation
 but if your philosophy
you hate the word philosophy i know
if your technology of inner engineering
and well talk more about that in just a moment
is available to all of us to in a sense find strength within ourselves
sadhguru
then does that mean that the atheist and the agnostic and the skeptic
can also embrace spirituality
is inner engineering only for those who believe
or is it for anyone  who asks questions
 the previous question is a loaded one still not answered fully
 yes i know  i havent
i havent given up on it yet 
 coming to this
see youre putting atheists and agnostics and skeptics together
its a wrong classification
atheists and theists are together theyre one kind
 because they both have certainty
 both both believe something that they do not know
both are not sincere enough to admit that they do not know
this is the biggest problem
the biggest problem in the world is
people are still not straight enough to come to a place
what i know i know what i do not know i do not know
because they have not realized the immensity of i do not know
i do not know is the basis of longing to know
and seeking to know and the possibility of knowing
the moment you destroy i do not know
you destroyed all possibilities of knowing
so this is atheism and this is theism
theyre not different
theyre in the same boat
they pretend to be different
one believes positively
another believes negatively
but they both believe something that they do not know
one  person a wellknown person in the country
who goes about claiming hes an atheist all the time
one day comes up to me
somebody just introduces me first time
i said namaste'
he says do you know i believe there is no god
i said i dont even believe that 
 do you mean javed akhtar 
 i im not
 that was a good imitation
so i guessed  it wasnt difficult
 i am not  taking names
i am saying the thing is you also believe something
you dont seem to understand that
the most important thing is to come to this place of
being utterly straight and sincere with life 
what i know i know what i do not know i do not know
if you come to this much
if you closely pay attention to everything around you
you will see with all this scientific exploration
we do not know even a single atom in its entirety
thats the fact
 so what is it that you know sadhguru 
why are millions of people your devotees
because you just said that honesty
 they usually dont
 is about admitting
 they they dont claim that they are my devotees you know
 what do they say then
 hmm
 what do they say then
 usually they claim theyre meditators
volunteers and stuff 
 okay volunteers then 
but there must be something they think that you know
because you just said that life is actually about admitting what you dont know
the corollary to that is there are things that you do know
we do know were sitting at the habitat center amphitheatre at this moment in delhi 
that we know
what beyond this sadhguru do you know and what do you not know 
ive asked you like is there a question of
 now what do i know
i dont know anything except this one 
i know this piece of life from its origin to its ultimate
everything that i need to know about this life i know
and i see every other life is actually the same thing
if you look deep enough
so in that context
because today modern science is coming to this
there is a a theory which is evolving
which is called as constructional theory
what they are beginning to say is
whether its an amoeba or a grasshopper or a earthworm
or a bird or an animal or an elephant or you or me
or the whole cosmos
the fundamental design is same
it is only a question of complexities and sophistication of the same design
so this is something always the yogic science has been saying
that if you know you know anda you know pindanda  you know
if you know the atomic you know the cosmic
because the fundamental design is same
its only a question of complexity and sophistication of whats happening
so fundamentally if you know this piece of life 
you know everything by inference
 but when you say this piece of life do you mean yourself
do you mean this moment
what do you mean by this piece of life
 you are a piece of life arent you
are you life or
are you media 
 are they mutually exclusive
 arehave mediums
thats why im saying 
 i would hope im a flesh and blood person
unless somebody knows better 
 flesh and blood you gathered isnt it
 yes
 what you call as my flesh and blood
you slowly gathered over a period of time
if this much accumulation of flesh and blood
this much impressions have to be gathered
there must be something more fundamental isnt it
 do you think of yourself as a yogi a mystic or a guru
 ive not wasted time thinking about myself 
 what would you rather be thinking of
 i dont think usually
really
for me see th this whole thing
because of the type of very mediocre education thats being delivered today
we have raised thought to heaven unfortunately
thought is a simple thing
i know this is against everything that you believe in
because you are also a believer 
 no
 believer in thought
 yeah
 yes
 i believe in being able to ask questions
 yes
 thats what i do for a living
 oh  thats good
 so i must believe that it is possible to ask questions
 you you ask questions for a living
my life is full of questions 
now now the thing is what you call as thought
is coming from the limited data that you have gathered from the experience of your life
every person is the same thing
how much ever we have gathered
its still too small compared to the size of this cosmos
and the way the phenomena of life is happening
from this limited da data
you can recycle things and generate thought
or in other words
nothing new ever happens
same permutations and combinations of the same thing will go on forever
the essence of what were teaching in the name of inner engineering is
to engineer yourself in such a way
every moment of your life is a new possibility
if it has to become a new possibility
what is needed is perception
when i say perception people think opinions
no i am talking about perception
as you see here 
similarly enhancing your perception so that you perceive life
right now when we say thought emotion
were talking about expressing life
expression is not so important
once in a way we can express
but perceiving it is important
because this phenomena is too fantastic
its not a small thing
the greatest phenomena thats happening here is life itself
so if you want to know this phenomena
the only way you can know
the only doorway for you to know life is yourself
see right now can you see me
 yes i can
 can you
can you use a finger and point out where i am 
oh youre wrong
you know im a mystic from south india 
now this light is falling upon me reflecting going through your lenses
inverted image in the retina you know the whole story
where do you see me now
 still in the same place
 no
 i do
 you see me the way im projected in the firmament of your mind
you cannot see me here  in the very nature of your visual apparatus
where do you hear me right now
within yourself
where have you seen the whole world
within yourself
now if there is a grasshopper here
he doesnt see me the way you see me
he sees me differently
he sees the whole world differently
now you you can think oh hes no good
this is the fundamental problem that we think his perception is no good
no no his perception is very good for his survival
your perception is very good for your survival
but its not good enough to know the nature of life
 but i
 so now what do i know means i have enhanced
enhanced my perception the way it is important
to know the nature of life
not just for survival
 but if inner engineering as a spiritual technology is something that works
i ask you again
why do we need gurus because
that means the answers are within us
 youre speaking so much language
did you learn a b c d
 i think so
 do you remember when youre four years of age
that damn a how complicated it was
 yes
 two versions to it
you had to write it a hundred times to get the damn a
today you can close your eyes and write
so it doesnt matter how simple something is
without a certain guidance
could you have picked up a b c im asking
no
similarly when something new you have to approach
if you dont have the right kind of guidance
you wont pick it up
 tell us a little bit about yourself
your story is wellchronicled
but what is of interest to people is that you started off as
 i havent read that book
i dont know
i hope shes written nice things about me 
 shes written a very brilliant
arundhatis subramaniam has written a very brilliant
very brilliant book
 no shes brilliant
but whats she written about me 
 one of the things that she has said is that
you give great space for dissent
you like a good argument
that youre not an youre not one of those dictatorial gurus 
 i dont know where is a dictatorial guru
i think the most people have not met a guru
they have just seen calendar images and made conclusions
i dont think they have met any genuine guru
there are a whole lot of people who should have been temple priests
who are good entrepreneurs and theyve become gurus today 
thats different okay 
 temple priests
 no no see
  who have become good entrepreneurs
 no im saying
 just another word of
way of saying theyre charlatans
 thats a strong word
maybe thats enterprise 
i am not a enterprise
so because i am not an enterprise
i want everybody to ask whatever the damn question they have
it doesnt matter how ridiculous or how intelligent
how nonsensical it is it doesnt matter
if the question means something to you
it means something to me
it doesnt matter how brilliant it is
if it doesnt mean anything to you
i am not willing to listen to it
 but youre saying that many
many people are who are positioning themselves as gurus
are really only elevating themselves and fooling people ive
  no i didnt say
 okay im saying that
 im saying 
 but
  the thing there is there is a vacuum
somebody is trying to fill it
 yes and sadhguru you have been
 are they qualified to be that
questionable thing
 but a very genuine concern
and you have been on some of my television programs
where we have spoken about this 
is whether godmen are often conmen
and how does this lady here  know the difference
between whos a godman and whos a conman
and is a human being capable of being a godman
do you think of yourself as a godman
  why are you underestimating that lady 
 okay let it be my question 
how do i spot the difference between a godman and a con man
if i dont even believe that humans can be godly
i think humans can be brave and wonderful and inspiring and
but i dont think that they have magical powers
 see did you ever see god having magical powers
 no ive never seen god
 no then why are you saying he must have magical powers 
so first of all
this godman is essentially a mediacoined word
nobody claims that he is a godman okay
some are goddamn men thats different 
nobody
i dont think anybody has personally claimed
i am a godman
i have not met anybody like that
now that is a
thats another kind of profession
putting labels on everybody you know 
leaving that alone what is it
this is a culture  you must understand this
its unfortunately all mixed up today
this is a godless culture you must understand this
there has never been an idea of a god in this culture
only in competition with what came from outside
because we saw they could rule us
they were dominant and we thought we have to imitate their ways
we also started making it up to some extent
not successfully though
yes
but we know the technology of godmaking
when i say technology
we are using the english word god
but that word doesnt exist in india
here we call them devas
what a deva means is
see today media is projecting tendulkar as a cricketing god
its very appropriate to this culture
because if somebody excels beyond a certain level in any field
he may be a sportsperson
he may be a warrior
he may be an artist
he may be anything 
if he excels beyond what normally average human beings think is possible for them
he goes
they recognized him as a deva
and hes worth looking up to
because he becomes a guiding light for them
thatll anyway happen whether you like it you believe it you dont believe it
 sure
 in every field somebody rises he becomes the light for the rest of the people
 yes
 so similarly in the inner spaces
when i say the inner spaces
the quality of your life is not determined by what kind of house you live in
what clothes you wear
what car you parked outside
what things jingbang happening around you
no
this moment how joyful peaceful blissed out you are within yourself
now if i sit here
were sitting here in the same space
breathing the same air
probably we ate the same kind of food
i dont know what you eat 
but if i sit here now with my eyes closed
the way i am within myself
i will not exchange this  for anything in the universe
now when people see no matter
the number of things im managing is insane
everybody thinks
sadhguru is it possible you must go crazy someday
all volunteers over three million volunteers
enterprises businesses okay projects megaprojects on the street
all kinds of activity going
around the globe
if anybody has to go nuts its me okay
because all run by volunteers
run by volunteers means
nobody is trained for the job
and you cant fire them for inefficiency because theyre volunteers 
all right 
and anytime they come in anytime and do great things
anytime theyll walk away all right
and nothing should collapse
till now i must tell you this
as we are sitting here this day
probably little over three hundred and odd programs
inner engineering programs are happening in the world
never in the last thirtythree years
one program has been abandoned or has failed 
that that takes enormous management
but nobody will ever see me getting angry or miserable or tensed out or stressed out
 youve never lost your temper
 you want me to now  
do i look like im incapable of that
its not that
its not that im incapable of anger
it's just that i have never given that privilege to anybody
ive not given this privilege to anybody 
they can make me happy
they can make me unhappy
they can make me angry
they can make me miserable
no
i kept  these privileges to myself
so people
youre talking about miracles or whatever
people ask me
sadhguru everybody in very ashram miracles are happening
you are beating all the miracles down
if we say something happened
you make us look like fools
no miracle
i say what you want me to pull a pigeon out of my pocket 
if i pull a pigeon
 but there are
 no if i 
 gurus
 if i
 who claim to do that
who have been challenged by rationalists
 no ill come to this
if i pull a pigeon out of my pocket
i have a shitty pocket 
and you have a bird 
what are you going to do with this
you come to me i will show you the miracle
i have thousands of people
who are working seven days a week
sixteen to eighteen days eighteen hours every day
in the last two fiveten years
not a single moment of irritation agitation anger in their life
this is a miracle 
this is a miracle we want to manifest
you dont want a miracle
 i agree this is a miracle
 yes
 and not that pigeon
do you have a pigeon in your pocket  okay 
 i told you i dont like a shitty pocket 
 i know  now you were thirteen
in arundhatis book
i read that you were thirteen when you first quite accidentally discovered yoga
you were children playing in
at the bottom of a well thats what the book says 
tell us how did you discover yoga
 oh  i told that because thats how it happened to me
i said that to her
i dont know how shes written ive not read it 
i said that to her because i want people to understand
the nature of the universe is
even if you do for the wrong reasons
you do the right thing still it works
if you do the wrong thing even for the right reasons it still doesnt work
people need to understand this
because the whole world has invested on goodness
the goddamn goodness is killing the world
therere too many good people
and these good people are the biggest problem
its always a good indian who wants to fight a good pakistani
good hindu wants to fight a good muslim
good american wants to fight with just about anybody 
the more good you are
the more fighting you are
the more good you think you are
because goodness is always in comparison
 dont forget the good journalists
who promote these fighting everyday on channels 
 i i think because your goodness comes
by comparing yourself to somebody
if you were alone on this planet you wouldnt know
whether youre good or bad
what we need on this planet is sensible human beings
little more sense we could do with isnt it for sure
in every aspect of life
engineering essentially means
you could have built this structure whichever way you want
but youll have to keep looking up
when its going to crash on your head
engineering means you put it up in a sensible manner
the way it stays without anxiety about it
similarly inner engineering means you engineer yourself in such a way
you can go through the process of life
without being anxious about your suffering
what will happen to me
there is no such thing because you engineered yourself well
whatever the hell happens around you
within yourself you are the same thing
so every time i launch one megaproject
youll say sadhguru if it doesnt work
if it doesnt work what 
if it doesnt work what
if everything that im doing if nothing works i will still die blissfully
this is guaranteed
i want to make sure its guaranteed for every human being
so that they can live their life without the fear of suffering
right now instead of seeing how suffering should go
people are busy romanticizing suffering
the moment you romanticize suffering
its very clear you are not interested in human wellbeing
you like drama
 hmm you often spoke about
how economic leaders are going to be the future of the world
youve been interacting with ceos
its rare to find a spiritual guru whos also quite openly capitalistic
are you a capitalist
 what is that
 who believes that wealth creation is for the greater good  of people and society
 see a whole lot of people are attached to poverty right now
because without poor people
without hungry people they cannot survive
i am not one of those
i want to see that six hundred million people on in this country
are postponing their dinner tonight
but we are postponing major decisions in the parliament every day all right
i am not a part of that
i want things to happen because i know what it means to postpone a dinner
i dont want that to happen to pe people
children are postponing their dinner tonight
probably a hundred million children in this country have postponed their dinner to tomorrow
and thats not a joke
so these jokers who identify themselves with this or that
are going on playing their joke on the people
every day
so capitalism is an ancient word it no more exists
we are talking about a market economy
when only a few families had access to capital it was capitalism
it is no more capitalism
any if you have a good idea
and you know how to execute it
there is capital for everyone all right
so we have tried communism
its a wonderful idea but that must happen willingly
if you enforce it its the ugliest thing
we have seen it
we have seen a major demo on the planet
when a most ugly things happened you tried to enforce it
karl marx might have known lot about economy
you know i was i when i was fifteen
i was all gung ho about engels  and karl marx and stuff
but he did not understand human nature
i realized that when i was sixteen
thirteen fourteen i was all fired up reading up all the communist literature from russia 
but by the time i was sixteen
i realized these people dont understand what is human aspiration
without understanding whats human aspiration
you try to build a society
you try to build a nation its a disaster okay
cruel disaster
but maybe it will work when really a country or a society is in total dumps
you have to force it out
when you have to force it out
it works
but after that it wont work
in a way if you come to the ashram
nearly four thousand people are living in the ashram 
well you can say its communist but by willingness
its not by okay i did so much so i get so much  no
everybody gets what they need
so this is not enforced this is by choice
if by choice youre willing to share how fantastic it is
but i have nothing you have something i want you to share  how ugly it is
 what is it with sadhguru and motorcycles 
 these days
im on four wheels 
 but you havent given up  your love for bikes or have you
 its just that when i was
i started you know trekking in the jungles when i was ten eleven
i would be gone
if i had ten rupees in my pocket
i would organize my food and im gone with this little note in the house
i can imagine my parents 
i i always wished i shouldnt have a boy ever 
 girls can run away too on bikes
 they run later 
they dont run at ten eleven 
and theyre on a pillion
theyre usually pillion and if they find a good rider no problem 
im saying the thing was
its not about the motorcycle or this or that
it is just that i was a cloud of million questions all the time
and wherever i looked nobody had a sensible answer
everybody has standard answers that theyve heard from somewhere
nobody has a genuine experiential answer
so theres a restlessness to explore just about anything
when i was ten eleven years of age i would be gone into the forest
for three four days
once food ran out and i couldnt survive then i would come back
so initially lot of excitement
but later on they kind of settled down
they knew ill get back
so when i became fourteen fifteen
i cycled across south india
not because i was one cycling enthusiast
not like today
wearing a helmet and suited booted for cycling  no
simply i cycled because cycling is little faster than walking
the moment i became seventeen
i still didnt have a license but i found a motor to my cycle
which became a motorcycle 
so that because it went little faster
it s it supported my restlessness to know something i didnt even know what the hell it is
i didnt know what i was looking for
but i had questions about anything i looked at
everything in the universe looked like a question mark to me
 but the question about the motorcycle is really to ask
whether the motorcycle the land rover or land cruiser which one is it now
land rover land cruiser  im not sure
but whatever the four wheels the helicopter you
i think you once said somewhere that i like
that whether if it moves on land water or air i like it
 this is not
one thing is i like anything that works and machines work 
the more efficiently  work the better they are
and why its important is after all
what is the quality of an individual human being
how smoothly and how efficiently your body mind and everything functions
is the quality of a human being isnt it
so machines always excited me
whether its a s bicycle or motorcycle or because of you know
lack of the necessary probably the fitness that i was at that time
i crisscrossed india on a motorcycle
today it would be hard so you get into something little more comfortable
 but you know while that makes you a very interesting character to observe
did you ever worry that youd be labeled or dubbed a richie rich  persons guru
this is you know this is the sadhguru who
 see the thing is
 flies his own planes
 no
 who likes his bmw
who like his game of golf
who likes having a little frisbee match on the  
  l lets lets come to that
see the thing is i would
i wouldnt mind
i even sometimes we i i ride a bullock cart
nobody reports that though 
i i i love to handle the bulls and
i i still drive that sometimes
but now you i want to have a conversation with you
this afternoon till two oclock i was in jodhpur
i could have come by bullock cart or a camel cart 
you had to wait for five days 
i came on time you must appreciate that 
 so its about efficiency is what youre saying
 yes so i l i personally learnt to fly a helicopter
where i dont have the time for these things
but i somehow fit in this and learnt because
seventy percent of our work is in rural india
tch i thought this little helicopter could just
i could set the place on fire
because im half the time stuck
half my life im on the road stuck in some traffic driving myself
all the time behind huge
everywhere theres no place in the country where theres no traffic jams
believe me even in rural india therere traffic jams
so i thought a helicopter would really revolutionize our work
i picked up the thing i got my license
faa license but in india its so difficult to get the license
because many of these rules were made before wright brothers  came 
 well according to some
the plane was also made before the wright brothers came 
they say it was made in the vedic ages they
 they're not very wrong
conceptually it was made
whether physically they built or not
we dont have proof for that conceptually theres no
 conceptually its about imagination to think
that you can move from place a to place b
 no no no no no no no
you cannot conceptually imagine something entirely
even if you imagine
you must be able to produce some
you must understand the principles in some way as to why something flies
if you dont understand why something flies itll be like that you know once it happened
a little turtle very with great effort
climbed a tree went to the edge of a branch and jumped fell flat lot of pain
slowly again he crawled up in another two days again up jumped fell down again up fell down
after a few days two birds who were sitting in the opposite tree
they were talking and they said
i think its time we tell him hes adopted 
all right 
so im saying what cannot fly
you cannot make it fly
people thought in detail as to what can fly
what cannot fly
conceptually they thought
whether they built or not we dont know
and is it is it i mean it is an established fact
they calculated the speed of light
somebody some individual cannot calculate the speed of light just like that
if there was no whole scientific culture around him
no individual will just drop from heaven and calculate the speed of light okay
there must have been a scientific culture
otherwise it wont happen
but we need to understand there is a difference between science and technology
 but theres also a difference between science and mythology
some things are just great stories
that doesnt mean they actually happened
 see for example
there are there are images or there are sketches which show
which probably somewhere between three to four thousand years ago were made
where it clearly shows a turtle and a round planet sitting on it and going around
turtle is the best example
best analogy for a planetary movement
because a turtle cannot accelerate 
same speed he just keeps going
so a round planet on a turtle
is the best way to describe how a planet moves around
and the very word for geography in this country is bhoogol
which means its a round planet
so it is not because of galileo we know its a round planet
weve always known
how do we know
we cant know just one scientific fact and not know the other aspects related to it
so this thing about anything indian beating it down is because
one thing is that culture has evolved because half the people
their brains are in greenwich mean time
theyve still not gotten out of the 1948 whatever happened
we struggled for independence we came out
not just to send them out but to be who we are
so that problem is still there
and now there are upstarts who claim all kinds of things
there has to be an even balance
not beating down this or pumping it up in a  unrealistic way
but you cannot deny indian mind has thought about things
that nobody had thought about in those times
there is no question about that
but there is a distinction between science and technology
science can evolve because of certain intelligence
technology needs material manifestation
now we are trying to claim technology which we should not
if we just focus on science
many things will be attributed to india for sure
 we live in times when faith and spirituality have become very inflammable
 dont put them in the same basket
 okay lets talk about faith first
 mhmm 
 we live in times when faith for certain has become a very inflammable
easily politicized conversation
if faith should have been personal today its not
today you actually have decisions taken in the name of somebodys faith being injured
so you mentioned food right now
i read somewhere that you said theres nothing religious about the act of food
just eat what you like
 no no no i didnt say that
 eat whats good for you
 i said eat whats good for you
 okay eat whats good for you
 its a very different thing 
 i correct myself   eat whats good for you
but today we have a highly politicized conversation around banning beef in the name of faith
how
 its definitely not good for you to eat it
 beef or any meat
 ill come to that
finish it finish the question
 okay okay so im offering that as one example of
how i see a politicized conversation taking place around faith
how do you reconcile the faith of a large number of people
with questions of individual liberty
i know i have read that you like books written by salman rushdie
we were the first country to ban him again in the name of faith
how do we reconcile faith with individual liberty
 see its always been said faith moves mountains
yes but it freezes your mind
but the greatest crime you can do on this planet is to move a mountain
you should not move a mountain it should be where it is
it has not just dropped from somewhere
its grown because of various forces functioning in a particular way
phenomenal activity has happened to build a mountain
you should never move a mountain
but  people with frozen minds always want to move a mountain okay
having said that
when we say faith
its an import for this culture
we have never had faith in this culture
you must look back little beyond thousand years
since weve been under occupation
here we have been told always your life is your karma
karma means action
whose action your action
so what we are saying is your life is entirely your making
there is no someone sitting up there and managing this for you
this is entirely yours
but for every action that you perform
whether physical mental emotional energywis
whatever kind of action you perform there is bound to be a consequence
if youre ready for the consequence do whatever
if youre going to cry about the consequence control the action right now
based on this now you came to food
see the food consumption has been looked at very carefully in this country
if you just bring this back the world will be healthy do you understand
here we have identified different type of people
what they should eat
if youre doing menial jobs how you should eat
if youre doing trading how you should eat
if youre into spiritual process how you should eat
if youre into education how you should eat
why this is is each person needs a different type of building of the body
you want to run hundred meters next to mr bolt
what kind of food you should eat
you just want to work in delhi what kind of food you should eat
you want to think in a certain way what kind of food youd you should eat
for all these we have very clear prescriptions
now when it comes to food
what it means is we are taking another life whatever that is
it may be plant life animal life whatever
youre taking another life
ingesting it and you have to make it your life 
thats the whole thing
what is your life what is that life if you look at it
all life on this planet is coming from the earth
this body is also the same soil
this is also same soil
if there is a earthworm that is also same soil
but see how it has become how this has become
how that has become
if i give you you like a mango or a banana
 mango
 mango i know  youre ru
youre ruling the state right now referring to the aam aadmi party
now if you eat a mango this mango becomes a woman in you
if i eat a mango the same mango becomes a man in me
if a cow eats a mango the same mango becomes a cow in the cow
why is this happening
there is a certain information or software in you
whatever you eat it transforms it into a woman
if i eat it transforms into a man
if a cow eats that becomes a cow
so every life is happening the way it is happening
because of a certain dimension of information
or in modern terminology lets call it software
there is a certain software which is an arrangement of information
now the idea is to eat as simple a software as possible
if you eat that kind of life which is a very simple software
your ability to override that software and make it entirely a part of you is very good
as that software gets  complex
more and more complex
your ability to integrate it goes down
so especially if its a creature which has some sense of thought and emotion
if it has emotion then you should not eat it
this is the understanding
an animal which has any emotion
displays certain emotions
especially if it displays emotion which is near to human emotion
you should not eat it
because it will not integrate itself
that animal nature will start manifesting itself
or in other words in india
today maybe in cities people do not know
you see in the villages
people have very intimate relationship with a cow
they have drunk the milk of that cow
their children are drinking the milk of that cow
there is a very deep relationship
if you do not know this cow is one creature
if something happens to you and you are in some kind of grief or misery
you dont have to be near the cow
wherever the cow is in your house
it will  itll start shedding tears for you
you know ive seen this with my eyes i couldnt believe 
when somebody is dead in the house it what does a cow know
it is somewhere simply tears flowing
so when its has such deep emotions
if you kill it its like killing a human being
its murder or its cannibalism
so because of that  this is not a faith thing
this is not a religious thing
we thought this is a fundamental sense
why when we are hungry why cant i cut you up and eat you
whats wrong 
whats wrong im asking
 but what youre saying should be about many more animals than just the cow
 yes yes of course
 and when it becomes about only the cow
then there is a there is certainly a perception
 i it is not
 that it is a political decision or a religious decision
 no no i am not talking about the whatever the laws that are happ
 this is not about people getting up and saying
its cruel to be to be a meateater
that would be a different argument
 hmm i am not even talking about cruelty
even cutting a plant is cruel in my experience
but you have to do it
but if you are conscious of it you will do it to the minimum possible extent
not do it wantonly thats the whole thing
now about this political ban about cow slaughter or whatever
this has many things
one thing is there is a sensitivity
once you drink milk from the cow she is like your mother
killing your mother and eating her up is something
people cannot digest in this country
still eighty percent of the people belong to that category
and theyre theyre hugely
theres a huge emotion
such a emotion which because theyve always been made to be docile in a certain way
they have not violently reacted to it
but in some places it has happened
in villages and other places
there is already a beef ban in many villages just by norm
not by any law that you dont bring these kind of things into the village
i am not saying you must ban it or not ban it
i am saying the sensitivities of your population you
without considering you cant go do this blatantly
because it is growing
its becoming a growing business
india is becoming a major exporter of beef thats not right
even if somebody ate something it is up to them
its their personal taste whatever
but now youre promoting it and youre making it grow
there is serious concern but our people dont express it
our people dont go out on the street and not going to kill anybody
because they killed a cow
so ban is not what is needed
more education was needed rather than banning
 but you havent spoken to what happens when faith
faith repeatedly seems to come into conflict with individual liberty
by the banning of books
there were people killed in paris
because they were seen to have mocked
you know of the prophet mohammed and so on
 see
 so where does this end
where do we stop violence and politics in the name of religion
 if you if you want that to stop you must understand this
youre saying today today its not today
in the last 2000 years this is the history of the world
continuously its happening all over the world
 so is that bombers are a new phenomenon
 well youve forgotten about the crusades and the other things
which have not been reported in history 
hundreds of millions of people have been killed in the name of god all right
its new to us here but even here
thousands hundreds and thousands have been slaughtered in northern part of india
just because the faith that they belonged to when the invasions happened
nobody writes about it because we never took the pen and wrote
somebody wrote history for us the way they like it
because all history is sponsored by kings
they wrote the history the way they want
and they said they are great emperors
but what they did was absolutely terrible
so you need to understand faith is a new thing to us
when i say new
in this country which has 1215000 years of history behind us
1000 years is new for us
weve still not come to terms with it
were still struggling with it
but struggling within ourselves
not creating a struggle on the street because thats not our nature
because here always weve  been drilled into us
whatever you do therell be a consequence for you
even if you come back another life another life it wont leave you
itll come back to you tch this has been told
this controls people this is a
this is a tremendous technology please understand this
and its not simply a fake thing it is a real thing
everything that you think feel act there is a consequence
not because there is somebody thinking he must give gift
give you a reward or a punishment
it happens in your own chemistry
 how do we keep faith
which you say is new to us separate from politics
you have you have in the past for example
i remember when anna hazare was lodging his anticorruption movement
you did come and applaud it
but you said that the lokpal was not some magic wand
i remember you saying that
do you believe that we are seeing a dangerous cocktail of faith and politics
getting more and more mixed up
 see it is happening
im not saying no
but its much less than ever before
 really
 yes
 it seems to be much more than ever before
 no thats because of you 
thats because
thats because if if ten people get beheaded in some remote part of iraq
you make sure the blood spills into my sitting room
because of that
otherwise youre sitting here now
today lets say 1000 years ago
we were sitting here
1000 people got killed in iraq
we will sit here peacefully thinking world is going really great

springtime 
everything is nice
so this is because the dissemination of information
if ten people get killed somewhere its a huge thing
because it comes into our sitting rooms bedrooms dining room
everywhere there is a television
so it pours into our homes
so it is happening
so this is good because even a small thing looks magnified now in peoples experience
but this has been happening always
its happening at its lowest level now
here and there it spurts up which needs to be controlled for sure
but what i see is
for the first time
for the very first time in the history of humanity
even if you
the numbers are not qualified
because the population has increased
even in terms of percentages of people
how many people can think for themselves today is huge
compared to what it was a hundred years ago or five hundred years ago
or 1000 years ago or 10000 years ago
all these centuries
there would be one man in the village who thinks for you
who reads for you
who writes for you
you just have to do what you have to do simple things
today everybody is able to think for himself or herself
now human intellect is blossoming
i do not say it is blossoming in the right direction
with the right sense
no
insanely it is blossoming
it doesnt matter insanity will happen for some time
people will come to their senses
when something is new theyll go crazy after some time theyll come to senses
once human intellect blossoms sufficiently on the planet
then this looking upward for wellbeing will not make sense
believe me
right now from looking upward
slowly the world is tilting for
in pursuit of human wellbeing people were looking heavenward
still many are thats different
but a whole lot of people have started looking outward
so if you look heavenward hallucinations will happen
wars will happen
because my heaven and your heaven different you know
none of the heavens have anything for women
you better know that 
 i am definitely going to hell  anyway
 so you believe in heaven and hell 
 i was being facetious
i was being facetious
 let me finish this
 i was being facetious
i dont know if there is somebody up there
 thats fine that is fine i
 is it a force is it energy is that inside me
 no im saying this
this thing about looking heavenward is slowly going away
and in pursuit of wellbeing people are looking outward
this is ripping the planet apart
human pursuit of wellbeing is just destroying the planet
now the fundamentals of what we are transmitting
the fundamentals of this culture
which is essentially rooted in the yogic culture
what you call as indian culture or hindu culture is essentially a pure yogic science
in the form of culture
it finds many colors and distortions
which is what youre seeing as the hindu culture or indian culture
whatever you want to call it
 but theyre not interchangeable terms
 why
 because were  a multireligious country with many different cultures
  we have i want you to 
i want you to understand the word hindu does not signify a religion
you ask them do they worship one god if they are hindus
in the same family theyre worshipping twentyfive gods 
they dont
they dont know which is the god
so theyre making sure worship everything 
just in case something will hit okay 
now the word hindu means the land between himalayas and indusagara
this land this subcontinent is hindu
all people who are born here are considered hindu
because its a geographical identity
i know theres a whole political issue if i speak like this
they say oh hes hindu
 no i mean people will tell you youre echoing the rss  chief 
 i dont know what he said i have not
 he said all indians are hindus and there was a huge
 okay i am not
 political outcry over that
 okay all indians live between himalayas and indian ocean 
 thats okay
 those who want to jump into the ocean
 thats okay 
 if you live  see this is a dialectical culture
it expresses things in a certain way
between himalayas and indian ocean if you live you are a hindu
if you jump into the ocean and cross you are a lanka okay 
so i dont know what is the struggle about this
this is because there is such a narrow understanding of this
this is the debate which we have to change in the country
because somebody has absolute belief systems
we are trying to compare that
to a culture where there is no such thing as belief
we have not ever been believers
weve always been seekers
this is a land where the highest value has never been god
always liberation
mukti
freedom is the highest goal
god has never been the highest goal 
so you you put this in the same box as something
which just believes this is it or youre dead 
unfortunate
thats not the way to look at it
this is what we have to bring back if we really value human freedom
you must bring back this seeking for liberation
i want to be free not just from others but from myself and my god and my heaven and everything
because god has never been the goal in this culture
god is just another tool
when i use the word tool for a god
people get very hurt
they say sadhguru dont say that it hurts us
i say thats okay you come to the ashram
ill give you some plumbing job  all right see
 thatll hurt more 
 no no no no spanner no winch nothing
use your fingers nails teeth whatever
three days later nails will be gone
half the teeth will be gone
then i will give you a spanner
will you worship the spanner or no 
we are who we are
as as human beings
we are who we are
only because of our ability to use a tool
otherwise you are not even good as a dog
you cant even fight a dog isnt it
 so youre against organized religion
quite clearly
if god is just a tool and
faith is not the same as spirituality
  no i see no no im not im not saying im against this or that
all im saying is i want human beings to come to this much
if you know something you know it
if you dont know something you dont know it
everything that you do not know you believe 
this is a dangerous thing
now the fight on the planet is
not between good and evil this and that no 
one mans versus another mans belief
im saying why the hell do you believe anything
because youre essentially not straight enough to admit
i really dont know
i dont know people cant fight
i dont know you dont know  can we fight
i know is a fight
i do not know is never a fight
i do not know is a way of seeking
if we do not establish this seeking in every human being
that every human being is longing to know
whether outside or inside whatever
you are
because this is the nature of human intelligence
it cant sit quiet
it can only sit quiet if you freeze it with belief system
if you seal it with belief system it can sit quiet
otherwise the very nature of this intelligence is it wants to know
 okay were almost at the end so i think im going take a few questions
just twothree minutes of questions
im seeing lots of hands go up
the lady behind you
yes please
 namaskaram sadhguru in one of your videos
you say that the problem with the world is that
most people lack the intensity
  
 most people lack the necessary intensity
 mhmm 
 and then you say the way is dhyana
so intensity is more associated to fierceness in personality
and dhyana is more associated to calmness
so theyre somehow counterintuitive
can you elaborate a little
 people think peace means rest in peace 
because their idea of peace is death
peace can be very intense
peace can be tremendously intense
because peace means the reverberations of life have become subtle and intense
action means reverberations of life are not so subtle
it is at a certain level
so peace happens not because
peace may happen if somebody is dead
but to be alive and peaceful means
you need to be highly intense state of energy
otherwise you cant be peaceful
the reason why most people who dont have any problems as such
you know after all theyre trying to earn a living
reproduce and bring up their children and die one day
just for that theyre freaking simply because of lack of intensity
because life is happening at a low ebb
naturally everything is a problem
if it rises a little bit suddenly you have a little clearer view of everything
for this you need a higher intensity of energy within you
and the yogic system is essentially focused towards that
dhyana does not mean   no 
 okay lets take the next question
here right here in the front row yeah
 sadhguru what i get from ishas philosophy
if i may say there is is
that you need to see internally
in your interiority
you need to fix it internally before fixing your external situations
but is it also not right
is it also not very important to do the right thing externally you know
just to make myself more clear you know
if i be more precise
 no no im clear i get the question 
why do i look so dumb 
 lets say you know if somebody
 i got it
 yeah
 i got it
 if somebody is born
 i got the question 
 ishas philosophy is not about looking internally or externally
it is just that if youre looking for mangoes
you look up the tree
you dont dig the earth all right 
but if youre looking how to plant a mango tree
then you dig the earth
youre looking for mangoes if you dig the earth will you find it im asking
so if you inner things you must look inward
outer thingsyou must look outward
there is no such philosophy 
look out or look in
wherever the damn thing is
look there 
 like you know shankaran pillai went for a job interview 
and they asked him
which is further mumbai or moon
he thought profoundly and then said mumbai
they said how do you say this
he said i can see the moon i cant see mumbai 
 okay last question yeah
 namaskaram sadhguru i just want to ask
 hold the mike closer to you
 yeah i just want to ask you that
everybodys perception of good and bad is different
and what do you think if we start manifesting our own good and bad
whatll be the state of the society
 hmm maybe you wont have power tonight 
i think i already made this clear
the biggest problem with the world is therere too many good people
not enough sensible people
sense is lifespecific okay
goodness need not be lifeoriented
goodness may be going to heaven
and the moment 
i want you to understand this dangerous concept
people dont address this 
the moment you believe
suppose i believe there is heaven and its a beautiful place
and you can live in the company of gods
should i send you there today or no
if i really care for you im saying 
yes
if i really care for you and if i believe theres a great place
should i send you there or not
this is a dangerous thing do you understand
if you stretch it to its logical end its a really dangerous thing
the moment i believe there is a fantastic place up there
i really love you and i want you to go there you know 
tch yes 
 okay let me just end by asking you something that we havent spoken
about and then ill hand it over to chiki
you said you love machines
 i didnt say i love them 
 okay you like machines
 i
 or theyre useful
 they work
 have our lives been overtaken by gadgets
 not mine
 no
 definitely not i use all the gadgets
but they dont overtake me
these are fantastic things in our life
things see in every way
compared to how a human being was lets say hundred years ago
youre almost superhuman
tch hundred years ago if i could just pick up something from my pocket
and talk to somebody in america right now
i would be superhuman
why superhuman
if i said im god people would have believed me
hundred years ago
five hundred years ago if i just had a light bulb
i would have become god on this planet
i want you to know look at the things we have today
we are really superhuman
once this kind of capability has come to us
little more sense has to rise
little more awareness and consciousness stu
has to arise
if this doesnt happen
this capability will turn against us
this is what youre saying
now gadgets are freaking people why
its a simple thing
you if you want to use it you can use it or you can keep it aside
because you are in a compulsive state
if you start using a cell phone you cant stop it
even in your sleep youre texting
see the boy is 
hes in a hes not with me hes in looking at me in the screen 
now this is the same thing
if food is good if you start eating you dont know when to stop
if you start drinking you dont know when to stop
if you start doing something you dont know when to stop
the same thing it is not about the gadget
it is not about the food
it is just that there is not enough consciousness
there is compulsiveness
everything is happening compulsively
instead of addressing the root youre trying to kill the gadget
gadget is a fantastic thing
every damn gadget has enhanced our life in a huge way isnt it
dont curse the gadgets
it is just that compulsiveness has to go
 well on that note i will say thank you for provoking us
as always a pleasure  to have you
a pleasure  
lets have a big round of applause for sadhguru here
