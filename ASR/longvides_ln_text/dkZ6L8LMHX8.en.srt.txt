 good morning sir
 namaskaram 
 two things ive never been in my life
are thin and nervous 
and i still havent been able to get over the former
but the latter is still very operational at this moment 
its because i dont know what to say
because i feel ive lived with you in this last week
ive done all my research
watched all your shows from 
 see you have
you have done your homework but
because i am homeless  ive
i have not done my homework
 i have done a fair amount of my homework
i have watched everyone from anupam kher to juhi chawla in conversation with you
barkha dutt to a very subdued arnab goswami as well 
i do believe in your mystical power because you managed to achieve that
and i think that is not anything lesser of an achievement than youve done 
within your span of tremendous work sadhguru
so my felicitations on that achievement 
and more than anything else
when i just saw the av that all of us saw
ive heard all these terminologies associated with you
which is from the monk on a motorcycle
rockstar spiritual energy
and i saw that happen
youre on a motorbike
you are flying a helicopter
so there are so many terms that i said
rockstar spiritual energy
and i want to create my own one say youre like almost the santa claus of spirituality 
because you bring the energy through that chimney of life
and i think have really touched so many millions of people across the world
so we are blessed to be in your presence at this moment
and i cant wait to be in conversation which is i am going to start
but i just want to start by saying that this is truly an honor
so thank you 
i mean as a filmmaker
as a human being
as a member of a humanitarian community
my head is always buzzing with so many questions
and i think we bottle it down to some spiritual inquiries
some religious ones
theres always been a debate about these two terms 
religion and then spirituality
there are people who feel like
im not religious im spiritual
and im not quite sure they know the meaning of that
but they use it because sometimes terms are just thrown around
to those people who are at the crossroad between religion and spirituality
what is your answer to that dilemma
 see we must understand this
it is in the very nature of human intelligence
that if you do not know something
if you realize you do not know something 
because most people do not realize that they do not know  
if you realize that you do not know
its very natural for your intelligence to seek to know
it doesnt need a guru
it doesnt need a scripture
it doesnt need somebody to introduce that to you
it is in the nature of your intelligence that you wish to know
therere lots of experiments to show
even mice if you leave them in a place
within two minutes they will research everything in that space 
for their own reasons of course
for survival reasons they
you know inquire into everything around them to find out how the place is
human intelligence goes beyond survival
so naturally human intelligence seeks to know many more things
which does not concern our survival
yes we are concerned about survival till a point
but once thats taken care of we cannot rest
we want to know more endlessly more
the more we realize we do not know
the more the longing to know
so this longing to know
when it finds a very intense expression in the form of seeking
we call this spiritual process
or in other words
the basis of spirituality is a realization that i do not know 
but the moment you say im religious
you refer to yourself as a believer
when you say youre a believer
what you are saying is
everything that i do not know i will make it up
how i make it up
whose help i seek to make it up
may be varying from person to person
somebody makes it up because of with spiritual assist
with scriptural assistance
somebody makes it up with the assistance of a priest or a pundit or a guru or whatever
but you seek some authority
you kind of make some compromise in your life
that instead of truth you settle for an authority as the truth
spiritual process means truth is the only authority for you
authority is never the truth for you
so these are two different aspects
unfortunately spoken in the same breath most of the time
so i would say spiritual process is far closer to scientific inquiry
see even the fly is trying to investigate me 
 trust me i am not investigating 
i am just inquiring
and i wish i was the size of that fly but anyway
  no no i did not
i did not use the word investigation in a negative way
nothing wrong with investigation
investigation means you want to know the truth
maybe its done little forcefully like a fly 
hes coming to you now 
 thats all i get these days 
 no if you get to fly what more 
 well you manage pretty well
i have a fear of turbulence 
so flying is really not on my top three things to do in life
 so spiritual process does not demand belief
because belief and spiritual process cannot go together
spiritual process is a constant inquiry to
it is a way of sharpening your questions
so they dig deeper and deeper 
not into something else but into yourself
the nature of your existence
because the nature of human existence is such that in our experience
the only thing that you can experience is yourself
you actually believe youre experiencing many things
but you only know everything the way it happens within you
you do not know any other way
even now if you see these people
it looks like they are there
but actually you know them or you see them only the way theyre projected in the firmament of our minds
there is no other way
there is no other way for you to experience this life 
except the way it happens within you
now spiritual process is a constant effort to see
that the way that it happens within me
is not a distorted vision
that my mirror is not a wonky mirror
it is a plain mirror 
that it shows me things
the way they way things are
it doesnt distort anything
because of my thought
because of my emotion
because of my attachments
because of my identities
because of the philosophies and ideologies that i identify with
i can distort my mirror
now i deprive myself of all that
so that i have a plain mirror
and i get to see everything just the way it is
this is spiritual process
 no well thank you because thats always been a continued dilemma
and i believe that the word spirituality is sometimes misused
where there is not a grave understanding of what it really is
and as you said that the i dont know
has immense power and i think acknowledging the i dont knows of your life really means everything
and i wish people would start doing that
because according to me
sometimes delusion is the biggest disease that plagues humanity 
when youre not aware of your own self
 no there are there are all kinds of idiots on the planet 
 yeah we work with many of them 
 but we must understand this
in the very nature of who we are it is such like this
if you do something stupid today
tonight your intelligence will bother you why did i do this
this is the nature of human intelligence
but the moment your stupidity is either scriptureendorsed or godendorsed
you can go on doing the same idiotic thing with enormous confidence
it gives you confidence without clarity
confidence without clarity is a disastrous process
if you do not have clarity
at least you must have hesitation 
 yes thats true 
well i have to say that i was 
i want to personalize this a little bit 
i was at a crossroad about thirteen years ago
and my father was very critically ill
and at that juncture of my life and before that
religion was organized in my life
it was what was taught to me
it was what i thought the right thing to do was
when he was in his last stage
there were things suggested to me
which were to me now completely ridiculous
including going to a certain temple and feeding a cow of a certain color
and doing a certain ritual at home
and all those things that one did even without even thinking
because as you said when you spoke about the idiots on this planet
i was definitely one of those in that stage in my life
but sometimes you reach a critical stage
where you seek any kind of desperate measure
and you try to kind of hold on to any hope
that even something that is advocated to you
that goes against your grain of intelligence or thought
to those people what is your advice
who have reached the end of their rope
and are hanging on and holding on to anything
be it religious
be it spiritual or be it
an unfounded piece of advice
 see for all this
the fundamental basis of these kind of aspirations or actions
is because people are just shit scared of life
why is it so
its like this
suppose you sat on a bicycle on stand you know
and started simply pedaling for fun
but it came off the stand and started rolling 
anxiety
faster  fear
very fast  terror
the fundamental reason is
but someone who knows how to ride a bicycle
the faster it goes the better it is
but for someone who does not know how to ride a bicycle
the moment it moves terror will happen
so the fundamental thing is just this
you have been given a very complex and sophisticated vehicle
to pass through the process of this life
which is human mechanism
there is body mind emotion energy
many dimensions to it
essentially this human mechanism is a very complex phenomena
now you are going at it
you are trying to walk through life
without understanding a thing about the vehicle that you are using
every time it moves there is terror
if it doesnt move you want to die of boredom
if it moves youre terrorized
there is no way out of it
tell me one thing tell me one thing that human beings are not suffering
if they are poor they suffer poverty
if they become rich they suffer taxes
if they are not educated they suffer that
you send them to school endless suffering 
they are not married they suffer that
you get them married  
 yeah i was heading to that next
 i didnt say a thing they are the ones 
 well thats an extreme validation of the institution 
 so tell me one thing that theyre not suffering
so now somebody develops a philosophy 
life is suffering
you know there are philosophies like this 
now its not about life
because youve not even touched life yet
all that youre dabbling with is right now
your own thought and emotion and its going crazy
so you are on a bicycle that you dont know how to ride
but this  is not just a simple twowheeled bicycle
its a complex machine
you dont know how to ride
you dont know how to manage your thought
you dont know how to manage your emotion
all these things
human experience is essentially happening from within you
whether its misery or joy
agony or ecstasy is happening from within you
at least what happens from within you
must happen your way isnt it
the world will not happen your way
but the problem now is
what happens within you is not happening yeur your way
whats happening in your mind is a dream
even your dream is not happening your way
thats the problem 
the problem is not that your life is not happening your way
even your dream is not happening your way
and this is the source of their misery
but they think its marriage
they think its children
they think its poverty 
no
fundamentally it is just that you are not happening the way you want yourself to be
thats all your misery is
so even if you want to learn to ride a bicycle
its a simple basic machine
it needs a certain level of attention and involvement
otherwise you cant ride a bicycle
takes an enormous amount of intent to want to ride it
otherwise its quite impossible to ride a bicycle
after you know how to ride it you can let your hands off
you can close your eyes and do all these things
 pretty much like marriage 
because like wheels are turning but going nowhere 
at times 
 no no i wouldnt like to make that statement 
because for a many people they have gotten somewhere with marriage 
 yes wed like to find out where 
but on another forum
when you speak about suffering sadhguru
it is definitely something that i believe
that selfpity sometimes is like a luxury spa
its somewhere where your comfort lies
selfpity is i believe the most indulgent emotion
and gets you nowhere but makes you feel really good for a certain period of time
what is your take on something like selfpity
 how is being pitiful a luxury
i don't understand that
 it becomes you know
you get great solace in that emotion  for a short period of time
selfpity can be the most happy place to be at
like selfindulgences
 see there are many ways to achieve piece
happiness wellbeing tch
this happened
shankaran pillai 
in his
he was a little abusive husband
verbally abusive
so he would rant at his wife but she was always peaceful
never reacted
one day in the middle of his raging rant
he stopped and he asked
whatever i say how much ever i abuse you you are peaceful
how do you do this
she said i clean the toilet
he said what cleaning the toilet
how does it make you peaceful
she said i use your toothbrush 
so dont fall on to that
 you are giving lots of people ideas 
so thats not a relationship
its a revenge story 
 no you can achieve peace and solace in so many different ways
i am saying 
 which is what you said
to draw from within to find your solutions
because the most exciting line that i read was
that life cant touch you cant scratch you
it cant harm you
you create your own energy in your own life
youre in this universe youve been brought into this world
and its in your control what you do with it
life has nothing against you what you achieve
and what you do is a result of your own actions
your feelings the pleasantness that you create within yourself
which to me was a very moving line
because it simplified a very extensive and expansive feeling of anxiety fear
and all the turbulence that humanity goes through on a daily basis
to me three pillars of our existence are pretty much
family fortune and farishta
which is what i believe result of god religion everything else
when we talk about family sadhguru
there are few things that have always intrigued me
and i seek answers
or rather validation from a higher energy such as yourself
its like ive always questioned why theres an organic distance
between a father and son
why there is always that angst in that relationship
and i am sure there are many in this house
that have experienced that emotion in their own homes
in their own environment
where do you think the origin of that distance came
 because every generation makes the same mistake 
which means theyre not learning at all 
when we say family
you know in italy
family meant crime
 crime
 yeah
mafia was always referred to as the family
 family
 yes so in a way its a kind of crime
it is the most basic institution in the making of a society
but it does not mean you must remain basic
because this is a biological identity that we have
biology is a reality we cant deny it
obviously this  was
in some way at least to a certain extent
our parents gave this  to us
one part of it at least
today the way it is
the way it looks is essentially because of them
well it was given to them by somebody else
thats another point
but to us it was given by them
so its a biological identity
this limiting oneself to ones biological idetity
identity for an entire lifetime
is is a crime
because it creates so many things
in this country
this country has suffered a lot from a long time
just now you released the mahabharat video
entire mahabharat is family problem
it is dhritarashtra syndrome
we are still suffering 
my son is best no matter what
even today we are suffering the same thing
my son is best and he should become the king
no matter what
its not just
 some sons havent managed very well some have 
 so family is a basic identity that we are born with
its a wonderful thing when you are a child
because without that family support
you wouldnt be who you are today in many ways okay
with all due respect and regard and great respect
for the family because
human creature is born in such a way
that as soon as you fall out of your mothers womb
you are not ready get up on your feet and do things like other creatures
it needs a long gestation period before
a man becomes a man or a woman becomes a woman
there is a long period
where the incubation of family is most important and vital
theres no question about that
but youre supposed to grow beyond that identity
but a whole lot of people just never grow beyond that identity
for which they suffer
and sometimes if theyre born in certain places
they make the entire nation suffer 
you are supposed to grow out of that
as a child its most vital that you are identified with the family
but as an adult
youre supposed to grow beyond your biology
because biology is the most basic identity
one has to grow beyond that
so having said that
is it necessary that every father and every son has to have some kind of angst
it is not about father and son
it is just two men being accommodated in the same home 
when you were eight ten your father was godlike
so this problem started after you became fifteen sixteen
when you want to be a man and theres not enough space
this big man is occupying too much space 
and that man thinks
this is my space and who is this 
they cant recognize each other as father and son because
now there are
there is no father and son
there are two men in the same house
and theres not enough space
this happens not in just human families
every creature
whether its an elephant or a buffalo or whatever
in every creatures life
this happens that
therell be some friction
and either the younger one goes out or the older one goes out
this happens everywhere
because this is not a problem between father and son
this is two men trying to share the same space
and the same woman called mother to one and wife to the other  
 two men
well that certainly breaks a strong myth
that this country has operated with
because the problem was always meant to be two women  in the same house
and you just changed it on its head which i believe is true
because i believe the problem lies in the fact that two men cant be accommodated
 no it also happens between women in a different way
but women have a way of covering their frictions in certain way
they do it in a certain way in a feminine way
men will do it in more  
head to head on
headbutting is the mans way
womans way is different
she will do it differently but the friction happens
 and i feel its always like the mother energy of the house
that sometimes has to bear the brunt of this tussle in a family
its also the other thing that
an offshoot of that thought is that i believe very strongly
that the people you love the most
you kind of tend to dump all your anxieties your angers
your fears your insecurities
all onto that one source
that gives you the maximum love and the one that you love the most
why is it that we as a human race tend to do that
tend to lumber all our negative emotions on our most positive light source
 no no because if you try to dump it on someone on the street
theyll smash you up 
 so
 you are choosing a a safe place
 but is that always fair
 first of all
its not fair for you to carry anxieties and angsts and angers and problems within you
because
see if i try to torture you
you have some defense against me
either you will fight me or you will run away
or youll do something
you have some kind of defense
but if you start torturing yourself
this  is the most helpless creature
no
most defenseless
im telling you even an unborn child if you poke like this 
he responds
he defends himself in his own little way okay
but this one  is completely defenseless
when you start poking yourself
this  is a completely defenseless life
so the worst kind of torture
the lowest level of mind is one who tortures himself
but they always think
they are the highest level of people
i suffer for everybody 
you bloody suffer anyway 
if there is everybody you will dump it on them
otherwise youll simply suffer 
people come to me and say
sadhguru  i cant bear with my
you know my motherinlaw she is impossible 
my husband after all her son
my wife oh  she is terror for me
my boss he is not even human 
like this it goes on
i tell them you come dont worry ill give you a nice place to stay
ill give you good food
nothing to do
for your life ill take care of you
only thing is i will make some random checks on you
when i check you must be joyful
if youre miserable
i dont believe in feeding misery 
so you leave them in one place for twentyfour hours
you will see how they will mess themselves up
so when youre alone
if youre miserable you are obviously in bad company 
now you are thinking
because of this person i am suffering
because of that person i am suffering
just stay alone by yourself
without any entertainment
without texting
without television
without reading
simply sit in one place
joyfully let me see
most people cant stay there for five minutes believe me
they are not on facebook
they are not on twitter
theyre not this thing
because they have something to say or because they have fallen in love with the world 
no
if they stay alone theyll go crazy thats a fact
 what is i mean sorry to break that train of thought
but what is the solution to that kind of feeling
of just not enjoying your own space
 because we have not looked at how human mechanism works
it is like you have a super sophisticated machine
this  the supersuper computer out of
this  is the machine which dripped supercomputers isnt it
i am asking have you read the users manual 
thats all it is
the entire yogic system is just this
this is not a philosophy
this is not an ideology
this is not a religion
this is not a teaching
this is just the users manual
how to
how your body should sit
how it must breathe
how the mind should be
how the emotions should be
how the energy should be
what are the things you can do with it
how should you keep it so that this 
will function at its highest possible level
see the cellphone companies have been doing some research a few years ago
and they found
only seven percent
or only three percent of the people
no
ninetyseven percent of the people are using only seven percent of the cellphones capability
we are not even talking about todays smartphones
were talking about the dumb phones
so ninetyseven percent of the people are using only seven percent of a small gadget
if that is the fact
how much do you believe are people making use of this tremendous gadget 
just on the surface because they are never bothered to read the users manual
if you tell them this they say
sadhguru can you give us the users manual
its written into you
you have to spend some time with this  
this was written by the source of creation
not by me or you isnt it
you must learn to read
the problem is illiteracy
see suppose you are you do not you have not learnt the alphabet
well you have learnt english alphabet
lets say ill give you a tamil book
you look at it does it make any sense to you
you dont know the alphabet it doesnt make a doesnt mean a thing to you
because you do not know the alphabet
now this is the problem that in todays society
in modern education
we have not even brought fundamental literacy
towards how to read this book 
because weve never read this 
by accident we are managing it
if you manage by accident sometimes it works
sometimes it doesnt work
one moment you are happy
next moment you are miserable
one moment you are peaceful
another moments you are in turmoil
i was   you know
ill cut the long story short 
i was in tel aviv and somebody came and greeted me
shalom
i said what does that mean
he said this is the highest way of greeting
i said thats your opinion but what does it mean
he said no no no this is really the highest way of greeting
i said all right but what does the word mean
he said it means peace
then i say
why is peace the highest way of greeting unless you are born in middle east 
in south india
you come up to me in the morning and say peace
i will ask whats wrong with you 
i am saying if you deprive yourself of something for a long time
suddenly it becomes godlike
if you have not eaten for ten days
even if god appeared
whats the prayer 
food of course
so
once you deprive yourself of fundamental things
i am saying fundamental things because
to be peaceful and joyful is not the ultimate goal of life
if you want to enjoy your meal you must be peaceful and joyful
if you want to enjoy your friend you must be peaceful and joyful
if you want to enjoy your walk on the street you must be peaceful and joyful
if you want to enjoy simple things that you do in your life
you must be at least peaceful and joyful if not ecstatic
so it is a most fundamental requirement
this is not happening
people are saying this is the ultimate goal of life
even socalled spiritual leaders are saying
peace is the ultimate goal of life
such people will only rest in peace 
 in what i believe surrounds us all is urban angst 
i think that seems to be terminology that comes out of mental health solutions et cetera
and that seems to be rampant in many parts of the world now
including now slowly penetrating even in india
when people deal with mental health issues
like depression and anxiety
and those seek certain chemical imbalance issues that are told to them about
 hey theyre making you look very pretty on the screen
how do they do that
theyre not doing it to me 
 they are making my what my 
 look at yourself there
 am i looking pretty on screen
 yeah yeah see 
 okay 
 theyre not doing that to me 
 you are actually looking stunning to me sir 
 stunning is another word for shocking 
 well i was trying to find another adjective to counter that 
but back to me and my mental health issue 
i really want to know
its such an order of the day today
everyone seems to kind its almost
and i hate to say this with any
and i dont say this with any kind of disrespect to peoples personal circumstance
but i almost feel like today its talked about
like its almost a fashionable issue
where i think its a very serious issue
when people talk about mental health issues
like depression and anxiety
and seek counseling to sort those issues out
and then the diagnosis at times is chemical imbalance
and medication is given
what
and then your
well i know you hate the word philosophy
but all your teachings are definitely about finding yourself
and seeking that pleasantness from within
but to those who are not strong enough to achieve that and seek this assistance
what is your take on that
 let me correct one more thing in the question
this is
this is not a teaching
this is just a technology
i am just giving people simple methods
with which they can work
if people are coming for a teaching
theyre frustrated with me
because every time they come they leave more confused than ever before 
if they look
if they are more confused in a way my job is done
because 
my entire work is to get them out of silly conclusions 
that they have made about life
and confusion means you are still looking
you have an active intelligence
conclusions means
what is the conclusion of your life
hello
what is the conclusion of your life
you dont know
let me reveal the suspense to you
though as a filmmaker he wont tell you till the end 
i will reveal it to you
 sometimes we dont even know what happens after that so 
many of us are confused souls when we make movies
 so the conclusion of your life is youll be dead 
you think something else is going to happen to you 
youll be just dead thats all is the conclusion
so every time you make a conclusion
in some way you die you need to understand this
you kill something of yourself every time you make a conclusion
this is you in a state of committing suicide in installments
you may call this religion
you may call this philosophy
you may call this being socially whatever
but fundamentally youre committing suicide in installments
this is why
when you look at a child and yourself
you are less alive than a child
as you grow up should you become more alive or less alive
unfortunately most adults are less alive than children isnt it
you must be more alive
but unfortunately youre less alive
maybe your physical agility will go down with age
but your aliveness need not go down
aliveness is going down because
youre continuously making conclusions and conclusions and conclusions
as you conclude you become less and less alive
you know that there is that famous parable
which is all over the place
about adam and eve
it seems god told them
its a dumb couple
 kind of 
look at what we had to suffer as a result of them 
 no no not because of that
because they didnt know what to do with each other 
so god told them
you eat whatever you want but dont eat from this particular tree
you know what tree that was
 apple
 no apple means in old english just a fruit
 knowledge
 what knowledge
your parents tell you you must eat the fruit of knowledge
your teachers insist that you must eat the fruit of knowledge
everybody in the society
always trying to shove knowledge down your throat
but in it seems god told you not to eat the fruit of knowledge
and by eating that
that adam and eve fell
it is not about that adam and that eve
its about every adam and every eve
the moment you eat the fruit of knowledge you fall
because your idea of a knowledge is
the conclusions that you make about everything in the universe 
so this mental illness which is becoming pandemic
they are telling me 
i don't know how far these statistics are right 
they are telling me
over forty people particularly women in america
over forty years of age
nearly fiftytwo percent of them are on some kind of antidepressants
fiftytwo percent is not a joke
fiftytwo percent is not a joke 
it means entire humanity is becoming sick
we must look at it why
fundamentally
because you are banking on a few things for a long time
for your mental stability and emotional stability
all these things are taken away
one thing is as you mentioned
the crime that we call as family
it gave us the support
no matter what happened there was somebody always for you
others are with you when you do the right things
if you do the wrong thing theyll distance themselves
there was one bunch of people
who was like a for the circus that you do
they were the net
whichever way you fall
theres somebody to hold you for some moments
but that net is gone
now when you fall you fall
because of that people are cracking up
so if you want to remove
see in this culture
there was a time in the tradition
where thirty percent of indias population were monks
that means consciously they went beyond family
consciously they chose to live without family
to live without support
to live without a home
homelessness not out of deprivation but by choice
nobody ever had a depression 
because they transcended the need for the net
you learnt your trapeze bar act really well
now you can do it without the net
you are not good at it you better have a net isnt it 
otherwise your head will crack
right now thats all thats happening
the traditional support system that we had
were taking it off
when we talked about religion
with all due respect we must acknowledge this
today people are trying to go to psychiatrists
india doesnt have enough psychiatrists for onebillion people believe me
no country has and above all theyre very inefficient
because they can take only one client at a time
and they need lot of furniture like this 
its very inefficient
religion handled human psychological balance effortlessly
god is with you dont worry
it settled a whole lot of people
do not underestimate the value of that
it is very inexpensive mass psychiatry
where people 
no people
no no im not
this is not a joke
when you are mentally ill its not a joke
its a most painful thing
if you get physical ailments you will get everybodys compassion
when you get mental ailment youll get laughter you know unfortunately
because you dont know when somebody is sick
and when somebody is being stupid tch
you cant make out
this is the biggest problem
for those families who have somebody in the family who is mentally disturbed
you dont know when they are making it up
when they are really suffering
you cant make out
there is no perfect way
there is no science anywhere to tell you exactly when
because human beings can make up every kind of thing
you are an actor you know
i don't know you you are actor or
 i do most things yeah
 okay 
 we act even in our daytoday existence all of us do 
 no that is fine but are you actor just director
 no no i tried i failed 
 okay so all right you are a bad actor 
 yeah
but i am an actor nonetheless
 but at least you make other people act
 yes
 so you know in a cinema or drama you can act something
and make it really real to a point
where these 10000 people will sit and experience like its real
so when a mentally ill person is in your home
you dont know whether hes acting it up or its real
sometimes its real
sometimes hes playing with it
you cant make out
you dont know when to be compassionate
when to be hard on him
this is the biggest problem for people who have mentally ill
people in within their homes
this is the huge problem
because there is no perfect way of making a judgment
and it is not joke
see human sanity is a very fragile thing
the line between sanity and insanity is so thin
if you push it every day you will cross it
see when you get angry what do you say
whats the expression
i am mad with you or i am mad right now
so you are enjoying that little bit of madness
you crossed the line and it felt like
its some kind of a freedom and power
but one day when you cannot cross back
that is when suffering begins
and suffering means
its not like physical pain
its immense suffering
i have been around people who have been mentally ill
trying to help them
it is
nobody should have it
but unfortunately its becoming an epidemic in the world
that mental illnesses are growing like never before
because all the supports they had we are pulling it out
without replacing it
if people become so conscious and so capable within themselves
you pull all the supports everything will be fine
but without giving that competence
you just pull the supports
people will crack
in the western societies its happening large scale
we are not going to be far behind
especially the urban societies in india will move in this direction
because once again in many ways
urban india is more west than west
there are more people in denims here than in america 
 well no thank you thank you for that
because i know it is definitely a crisis that plagues us
and some as i said seek help
some who are helped
i am happy for them and i am sure grateful for resources that are available
and those that find pleasantness within themselves
i think that truly is a glorious solution to their issues
 see when we say pleasantness
human pleasantness can be looked at in many different ways
one simple way of looking at it 
because medical science is looking at it that way
i dont see it that way
but thats a consequence for me
 is every human experience has a chemical basis to it
what you call as peace joy love turmoil tranquility agony ecstasy
everything has a chemical balance chemical basis to it
even health and ill health has a chemical basis to it
today entire pharmacology is just about
trying to manage your health by using chemicals
its a today or a doctors or a physicians job is
its an orchestra of chemistry that hes trying to manage
put this pill something more happened
put that pill
then something less happened then do this do that 
trying to manage the orchestra of chemistry because
this  is the most complex chemical factory on the planet
this  is a very complex chemical factory
managing it from outside is  very very difficult
but you could manage it from inside
but you must have access to your insides
if your innards are not available to you
then how do you manage it from inside
you only try to manage it from outside
all even mental illness is a largely being managed by chemical input
but all the chemicals that you can think of on this planet
are in some way already present in this 
whether you are seeking medically prescribed drugs
or youre going for the backstreet drugs
whatever you are going
essentially you are trying to bring pleasantness within yourself
because health means one level of pleasantness
if if body becomes pleasant we call this health
if it becomes very pleasant we call this pleasure
if your mind becomes pleasant we call this peace
if it becomes very pleasant we call this joy
if your emotions become pleasant you call this love
if it becomes very pleasant we call it compassion
if your very energies become pleasant we call this bliss
if it becomes very pleasant we call it ecstasy
if your surroundings become pleasant we call this success 
so we are trying to manage pleasantness by putting chemicals
to what extent means 
these statistics are out now 
in united states
they are saying seventy percent of the population
is on some kind of prescription medication
the  most affluent country where there is enormous choice of nourishment
and lifestyles
here seventy percent are on prescription medication
so you are trying to manage your sanity and your health
by putting chemicals from outside
but there is no doubt in anybodys mind today
that this  is the greatest chemical factory
 but right now illmanaged
essentially you are a lousy ceo 
 that is true
what has always sadhguru has also left me in wonderment at times about
the usage of two words
which i am going to say it to you right now
terminology sometimes has a tendency of making you
even receive an emotion from within
two words being ego and selfrespect
now these are two pillars of 
what we believe is selfconfidence
which is unfounded i believe
ego
 hey who put a cow next to me 
 sorry
 who put a cow next to me
 put a 
well topical at least 
its part of the dcor or something
 because everywhere i go
people have been asking me questions about gau rakshak
gau rakshak 
now they put a cow next to me 
 well i was planning not to go down that path but now 
then since you brought it up 
no no not going there
as i was saying about ego and selfrespect
like we always say
like my belief has always been that maintain your selfrespect keep that
your ego can be flexible
because it should be convenient 
because i believe like your ego should be a function of your convenience 
how true is that or maybe both are unfounded
 this ego should be a function of your convenience is perfect
but nobody knows where ego is within themselves
do you know
 no
 nobody knows
 it arises at will i think
 no no no ego is a fall guy
when you do the good things its of course its you who did it
when you do nasty things
oh it was my ego
he is a fall guy
he comes up whenever something goes wrong 
whenever you are seen in a bad light
it was my ego its not me
so people have created a whole
lot of jargon like this
my ego my self
my consciousness
my superconsciousness many things
first everybody must decide
within this body of yours how many people are residing you must tell me 
if there is anything more than one
it means you either you are schizophrenic or you are possessed 
you need either a psychiatrist or an exorcist 
so you are an individual
an individual means not further divisible 
indivisible
this is why you are an individual
that means there is only one
this is the healthiest state to be that you understand
there is only you here
nobody else but you
if you realize this
then you will function completely differently
but you start playing this game 
whenever you are in difficulty you say it was my ego
whenever something else happens you say its myself
another time you say my lower self higher self 
all kinds of stuff
many identities within you
see this is the nature of a criminal  alias alias alias alias you know
so its a crime that you started
whether you will be caught in the web of that or you will manage doing
see if you do minimal amount of crime you may manage
only when you really get into it
then you may get into the web
otherwise many people commit smalltime crime
and then become very respectable in the society 
so if you do little crime of ego business self business
all this and then become normal youre okay
but if you play it too much
you will become mentally ill
because if there is more than one in this 
you will become sick
there you are an individual you are just one
now its very easy to transform this 
you cant transform a crowd of people
you can only transform individual people 
and if you take away this fall guy
one fundamental thing you have to do with yourself is
to see that no matter what happens in my life
if pleasant things happen
if unpleasant things happen
whether i am joyful or miserable
im successful or a failure
you know its just you
you and you alone
otherwise when things happen well me
when things dont happen well 
 so you say we always tend to blame ourselves into various parts
and then divine forces as well
 its convenient
its very convenient
but this selfrespect 
no no you should have no selfrespect
others 
respect is from another person
i respect myself 
what is this rubbish 
somebody else respects you because they see some value to you its nice 
but i respect myself  what is this
this is 
this is its gone further in the west
and people say i love myself
see to respect to love
the very word they are using is
there must be two
you can love somebody
somebody can love you
you can respect somebody somebody can respect you
but i love myself i respect myself
this terminology is the terminology of the insane
but its becoming popular
because the numbers are growing 
 by the hour 
 hey dont say by the hour 
then we will be blamed 
by the day 
 by the day okay we get that
we sign seal and deliver that 
is there a ceiling to extremity
to extreme emotion like love
when you love something
is there a time that you have to stop
is there any such thing as stopping the extent of your extreme emotion
and i feel that about even the negative emotions
when you love someone
how do you really stop the extent of it
 i would say
please i want you to listen to this carefully because
you will immediately tweet
sadhguru said this 
its a dangerous world today
if you love love strong
if you hate hate strong
whatever the hell you do live strong
its very important
otherwise you will live an insipid life 
not knowing a thing about anything
in
when adiyogi gave the yogic principles
he said anything in your life
it doesnt matter what
i have been telling people theyre not grasping it
they think
because too much this you know what to say
flowery teachings have gone into people
theyre not looking at what works and what doesnt work
they want something pretty
i am not interested in whats pretty and not pretty
whether it works or not is the only thing
ultimately what works is very fantastic 
so even if its anger 
not necessarily love or compassion
even if it is anger  just stay on it for twentyfour hours
anybody im saying just try this by yourself
twentyfour hours stay intensely angry let me see
believe me at the end of twentyfour hours or well before that
you will be enlightened
but you will see you are not capable of being angry
because to stay intensely angry
you need enormous energy
it burns you up
try one day
twentyfour hours stay angry
you are irritated that you can manage for the rest of your life 
stay angry really super angry for twentyfour hours
let me see
you cant manage more than three minutes believe me
you will feel drained out because it takes enormous energy
there are yogis who live like this
they are simply angry all the time
all the time not about anybody or anything
simply angry just like that
it works wonderfully
it works much better and quicker than love
only thing is
with that kind of practice within you
with that kind of emotion within you
you cant live in social atmospheres
youll have to withdraw to a mountain cave
and simply be angry about nothing
just like that
if you want to live in social atmospheres
you need to be in a pleasant state of emotion
otherwise you will get into constant mess
so should i stop myself somewhere
what you are asking is
should i be constipated about my love 
at least in love know some sense of abandon
that there is no brakes on it
i would say on everything in your life
in your car you must pull out all the pedals
only throttle should be there
yes
in your life there should be only throttle
because brake will happen when you die
its not for you to brake every day 
its not for you to control
your life will be curtailed somewhere
thats natures business
your business is to be full on because
life life needs your support
death is superefficient
did you ever see death happening inefficiently
hello 
wherever it happened it was a perfect death isnt it 
never happened inefficiently
but life happens inefficiently
life needs constant support
death does not need your support
stopping something is death in a way
so to love youre afraid
to laugh youre afraid
to cry youre afraid
to everything
nothing is done with abandon everything with constipation 
learn to do something with abandon because
if you do not know at least how to scream in abandon
there is no way you will ever know how to meditate
or to be spiritual
because spirituality is a state of total abandon
complete state of abandon 
 i endorse that
and i will try and live by that
but what happens when a positive emotion reaches its extreme stage 
and ventures into a dark area
like love can also transfer itself into obsession
 see
you are referring to
see its like this
suppose you dont have legs
and if i say come dance
you say no i cannot even walk without my crutch
so i cannot walk without my crutch
or i cannot live without you are not different
this is a very dangerous territory i am entering 
but it is a fact
i cannot walk without a crutch
or i cannot live without you is the same thing
because youre misunderstanding your dependence
and a certain relationship that you hold with somebody as love
lets look at this thing of what is love
see its a certain blossoming within you
now who are you in your life
who are you using as the manure
filth
see this flower is fragrant
not because somebody sprayed perfume to the roots
it is fragrant because somebody put filth to the roots isnt it
so now you found a little flower within you of love
who is your manure
who is your filth
now this is a dangerous territory for me to enter with you also 
but this is exactly what we are doing
now the question is just this
whatever is the most pleasant emotion within you
are you capable of bringing it on by yourself
or are you in a dilapidated condition of technology
that you are a push start machine
that somebody has to push you
otherwise you cannot be
your joy your love your peace your ecstasy
must be your making isnt it
so now your love will become about sharing your joy
not squeezing joy out of somebody
right now most peoples joy most peoples idea of a love affair
is more like a mutual benefit scheme 
you give me this ill give you that
you cant live without me i cant live without you
they will make sure that the other person also becomes invalid
and cannot live without me
yes
this is a very a very huge problem in the human societies
love is not happening as a flowering
it is something that we are trying to suck out of somebody
love is not about somebody
i want you to know this
maybe because youre a film personality maybe
you said you are not an actor but
there are many actors who are loved by people
people are in drooling with ecstasy simply looking at them
but the problem is theyve never seen them
theyve only seen that play of light and sound
theyve never seen them but they love them
so what i am saying is
you are capable of loving somebody that person may not exist
he may be animated
but you still love and you are experiencing all the fruits of love
i am saying love is something that you do within yourself
and blame it on somebody 
you can do it by yourself
for a long time in this country its been there
there have been meerabais and tukarams and others
they taught you you dont have to love and to be in an extreme state of love
you dont need anybody
you can simply do it by yourself
and not just in emotion
even physical ecstasies happened to them
simply because they are in a great love affair
with someone who is not even here all right
so it is something that you do within yourself
right now you are in love with somebody here
that somebody may not even know that you love them
but you can experience this isnt it
you dont need the support from the other person
this is an experience thats happening within you
love is within you if you wish
it is not that its sitting within you
there is no such thing
you are capable of variety of emotions
if you want you can make it's very sweet emotion
if you are in a very sweet state of emotion
people say oh hes very loving
you may not be loving in the real context of how they understand
but you are in a pleasant state of emotion
so naturally you do pleasant things
so people think you love them
 so make love an island not a country
 no no make love the universe not an island 
because right now when you say i love you
this particular person you only
when i look at these people i look at them like this 
this one person ahh 
this is an island love 
it is too discriminatory
this one face in these 10000 faces i love
rest  depressing looking at them
this is a very island love
i know you are in an island city
but its time 
 to go beyond
 its time that you understand
love is a happening within you
maybe somebody stimulated this
you are grateful for them
that they ignited this within you
but love affair is yours isnt it
its an inner experience thats happening to you
somebody is providing the stimulus
we are grateful to them that they are providing this
but they are not causing it
its been caused from within
and once you understand this
why wouldnt you be walking on the street lovingly
why wouldnt you look at a tree lovingly
why wouldnt you look at a buffalo lovingly
why wouldnt you look at the cloud lovingly
because it is not something thatll get over
should i control it
why
will it get over
there is no such danger
it doesnt get over
in fact almost everything that you experience
the more you exercise it the more its available to you
whether its your love or joy or hate or anger
the more you exercise it the more its available to you
because its after all your making
its entirely your making
so when its your making
why dont you enjoy it every moment of your life
somebody is there nobody is there
what is the problem 
 well that brings me to i think the
i believe the mother of a virus that plagues a large part of humanity is expectation
i have a simple theory that i try to expect less
because then i feel that ill be disappointed less 
and i feel to curtail your expectation is possibly the toughest thing to do
because we constantly expect from relationships
from the work we do from
 you are just talking to the wrong guy about this expectation 
i have the highest expectation of every human being on the planet 
and i know and i know they will disappoint me
i will die disappointed but joyfully disappointed 
 now joyful disappointment is a place sir that youve reached 
but that is not a easy place to reach for most of us
 no no no
see these things are not like that
to be joyful or miserable is essentially your choice
its a choice that you are making within yourself
maybe its an unconscious choice
anything that you do unconsciously
right now unconsciously my hand can fly
but what i can do unconsciously
i can do the same thing definitely consciously also isnt it tch
this is the fundamental difference between being human and every other creature
we are not doing anything different from what they are doing
we are doing the same things
but we do it little more consciously
suddenly its a different affair altogether
same things 
we eat they eat
they sleep we sleep
they reproduce we reproduce
they die we die
only thing is we are doing it little more consciously
suddenly it looks like another world by itself
we think we are above them
only because we can do the same silly little things little more consciously
so if i can move my hand unconsciously
i can also move it consciously
if i can become joyful unconsciously
i can also become joyful consciously
if i am joyful because of my choice
suppose disappointments are thrown at me
i will be joyfully disappointed 
and my expectations of people are very very high
i have an impossible expectation
so i know i will die joyfully blissfully disappointed
because i know the nature of the world very well
i am not somebody who lives in fancy lala land 
 so abundant love and no curtail on expectation
 oh
see love is not a quantity its a quality
it is not that if you do certain amount of things you are loving
there is no such thing
you can sit here eyes closed not look at anybody
and still be loving because
its essentially pleasantness of your emotion
how pleasant
i am asking is there any need to curtail pleasantness within you
now i am super pleasant
but if a child came
i may grab him and put him on my lap
if an adult comes you dont do that 
ill do this  okay
here dog came ill just do this 
but an adult comes another person comes you dont do this  to them
i am saying your expression will change from person to person
from relationship to relationship
what kind of intimacy and what kind of closeness you have with people
but does it mean to say that you should not this 
with as much love as you hug somebody or kiss somebody
should you not
should you not do namaskaram with as much love as you hugged your child
why not i am asking
because there is no
see this im im trying to demolish the word abundance because
when you say abundance there is also scarcity
there is no such thing
it is neither abundant nor scarce
if you are willing its on
if you are not willing its off thats all 
 as simple as that 
fundamentally there is always a need
a need for so many things
even when in your process
your professional process or where you garner wealth or income
and you keep going
there is a need to constantly get more than what you have
there is no satisfaction and a place to stop
is there an end to need
 no no no
there should not be an end
it is just that
now that you are asking this question
in some way you have realized that at every point of your life
you thought this is it if this one thing happens i am fulfilled
but the very next day you realize that this is not it there is one more thing and one more thing
and you know that after ten years still the same state will continue
so this means you are ready for yoga 
this means you have understood that your longing is not for more
your longing is for all
your longing to expand is not just for more it is for all
or in other words
your longing is in some way for infinite expansion
if you handle your infinite expansion unconsciously
and if it finds a very basic physical expression
we call this sexuality
what you are trying to do is
something that is not you
with physical contact you are trying to make it a part of yourself
you know it doesnt work
if you try emotionally we call this love
emotionally you are trying to include something which is not you as a part of yourself
this is your love affair
if you do it mentally this gets labeled as greed
ambition conquest or simply shopping 
if you do it consciously then we call this yoga
yoga means union
youre longing to expand infinitely
but because of little constipation in the head
you are going in installments
can you go in installments and become infinite i am asking
is it possible
can you count one two three four and one day say infinity
no you will become endless counting
so your longing is not for this much or that much
your longing is for everything
if you want everything you must understand that
you cannot do that physically
it can only happen in a dimension beyond physical
because physicality exists only because of defined boundaries
but there is something within you which doesnt like this boundary
which wants to stretch the boundary
stretch the boundary
stretch the boundary
you are looking for boundlessness
but you are not courageous enough or conscious enough to admit this
you want to go in installments
no what you are looking is for boundlessness
if you want boundlessness
it can never ever happen through physical means
so once it doesnt happen through physical means
now you use the most corrupted word called spiritual
spiritual does not mean looking up or looking down
going here going there
it simply means your experience of life transcended the limitations of being just physical
because everything thats physical about you is an acquired quantity isnt it
this is just a piece of this planet
what is up here is just a heap of impressions that you have gathered
so what you have acquired can be yours
can never be you
so this longing to have more money
more property
more pleasure
more something is not about those things
you are trying to find that dimension beyond physical nature
but because of constipation its not happening  
 im going to take the liberty sadhguru
to do what i normally do on my television show
which is a rapid fire round
 mhmm  
 the normally the end of this round
  see ive when i was young
i watched a lot of you know
wild west movies 
when you fire i also fire all right 
 no but i promise you
this is not that kind of
you are not in my line of fire  at all
i will not take the liberty of being that person 
these are just quick questions which when i ask for one word
you have to stick to that
because sometimes you have a tendency of not exactly answering the question asked 
but you give such a profound and prolific retort back
that it makes you very satiated
but in this case
my only request is that if its one word
then its just one word 
 okay
 and the end of this normally
you get a hamper 
but in the absence of a hamper here
you already have
 a cow 
 something right yes
so  and or this beautiful bouquet that is right next to you
but so there is no hamper
but you do will get my utmost gratitude 
thank you
 all right very simply
what is the one thing that is essential to living a balanced life
 sense 
 what is the one thing we must absolutely do away with in order to lead a balanced life
 senselessness 
 all right
i thought that was coming
first thing that comes to your mind when i say the following 
the first thing organized religion
 madness
 marriage
 cohabitation 
 competition
 stupid
 money
 useful
 love
 can i say a sentence 
 yes
i will allow that 
 most beautiful but unfortunately crippling for most people 
if i can little elaborate that
see if something unpleasant cripples you
something nasty cripples you tch
its acceptable
when something beautiful cripples you
its a true disaster  
 if you could ask one person alive or dead
one question
who would you ask and what would that be 
 i really sorted out all my questions
because i did not spend time educating myself or doing anything
i spent my entire life sorting out every damn question i had
i kind of run out of questions 
 and you certainly have not run out of any answers 
and you never will
best advice you have ever received
 nothing
 never
 no i never sought nor did i receive
i made myself in such a way
im incapable either of seeking advice or giving advice 
 in an imaginary
completely hypothetical situation
if you had a day off with no commitments
no responsibilities
what would you spend the day doing
 oh therere lot of things
this can't be one word 
 no its not one word
 see i have an indiscriminate sense of passion towards everything
there were lots and lots of things i did at one time
but these days time is not allowing me to do that
so generally if i have little time all i do is play golf
because thats safe and within the city and i can get back in time for something else to be done
but if an entire day is left to me 
which they have not done for a long time 
theyve not left it to me 
if that happens i will close my eyes and sit
because that is my the best the best
i am at my best when i truly have nothing to do 
 what is one thing youd like people to remember about you at the end of your life
 they must live so wonderfully that they dont even remember me 
 if you found a way to travel through time where would you go
 im kind of done with all those things 
 youre universe visited already
you have visas for every part  of this ecosystem
 if we can do some slow fire
 yeah
 because thats a question with many ramifications
this
for example traveling in the world
weve jetted around and now we want to travel to the mars
we want to travel to another place
and now thats not enough
we want to travel into the past and future
all this longing is again exploratory in nature
whether you go on vacation to maldives
or you want to go to mars
it is fundamentally exploratory
maybe youre also thinking of relaxation and pleasure and whatever
but essentially its exploratory
otherwise why cant you do it here
its something that you want to do
you want to touch another place
this longing is there in the human being
only as long as the life that you are remains in a seed form
that is it did not sprout and blossom
this happened
when adiyogi was expounding the science of yoga
and talking about the nature of the cosmos
how its related to your individual self
and what you can do with it
then the seven sages who were with him
they asked what is the nature of this cosmos
how big is it
where does it begin where does it end
so he laughed and said
your entire cosmos i can pack it into a mustard seed
because your ideas of time and space are essentially because
youre living within the framework of your intellect
if you cross that dimension
then there is no such thing as time and space
everything is here and now
so traveling through time space 
no it means nothing to me because
its difficult to express
difficult to articulate
if i sound little
i have a reputation of being very logical
but if i sound illogical or silly to you
you can blame it on my jetlag
ive just come from united states after six weeks
so you can say maybe he was jetlagged
thats why sadhgurus saying something silly
but im fine
im saying this because
you can't fit the universe into your silly little logic
todays human being is too overly enamored with their own logic
that theyre missing the entire life
the gamut of phenomena thats happening in the existence is missed
because the only way you can accept anything is
it has to fit into the square hole of your logic
anything that doesnt fit into your logic you will reject
in this youve rejected the entire cosmos
in this youve rejected the magic of life
you have become a slave of logic
and completely missing the magic of life
so this time space all this stuff is because
intellectually youre trying to dissect the universe
and try to understand this this this
tell me if you sit here
suppose youre very joyful
do you see
you will not know how the day passed off
and if youre depressed do you see the day wont pass
so time is a consequence of the miserable nature of human existence
if you were truly blissed out and ecstatic
you wouldnt know what is a day
what is a year
what is a lifetime
you wouldnt know
thereve been times i sat down i didnt realize i thought its five minutes
but people gathered around and started molesting my feet 
no because they
in their understanding i sat there for many days or whatever
this idea of time and space is a very convoluted idea
simply because people are stuck in the framework of their logic
my work
my fundamental work is to take people
beyond the framework of logic into the true magic of existence
our own existence
but it takes a lot of time
still my reputation is of being very logically correct
because im still trying to woo them tch 
still wooing them you know 
for the real thing to happen
they will take a long time unfortunately
because they have become such slaves of their logic
 what is the first thing you notice when you meet a person
 just everything
 everything
 everything past present and future  
 is it more important to do what you love or love what youre doing
 one word or more 
 the choice is entirely yours
 see if you are an intelligent person you will try to do what you love most
but if youre a genius you will do just what is needed 
 if you could be invisible for a day what would you do 
 you wouldnt know 
 with due respect what is your biggest weakness
 hmm biggest 
 what is your biggest weakness
 see what normally people treat as weakness in their lives
okay
let me give a normal answer
why
why am i going into all this
already you said im what what is the word
sashayed  hmm 
my biggest weakness is i love danger
without danger i cannot live
i need to do something which
which keeps me on the edge of being mortal
being alive and dead
i want to walk that line all the time
every day im stepping on it one way or the other 
is it a weakness
i dont think so but people think
sadhguru you shouldnt risk your life like this
but if theres no risk im feel
i feel im not being
because most of the time in my life
for whatever im doing
i dont feel tested
its only in moments of danger that i feel little tested
so my weakness is i like to be stretched you know
for all the time when i was riding across india and later on i started driving
my only wish was that
to find a machine which will test my skills
always found the damn things broke down if i took it to my limits
these days recently im beginning to get to do a few machines
which are testing me whether i can push it all the way or not 
maybe thats because of my age 
 no
 if i had met them much younger
i think i would have
 you would have managed to work around them 
one thing the world doesnt know about you
 they dont know a thing about me 
thats a fact 
 and the one thing you wish you could change about yourself
 oh i never looked at that 
i could speak hindi 
no im sorry marathi 
 the one thing you wish you could change about the world
 tch oh a lot of things
 one
 human beings 
 desperately in need of 
sir what would you consider to be your greatest achievement
 i dont think theres any
because i always fall woefully short of my own expectation of what i could do 
so i never feel anything is an achievement 
 is there a song you love and can listen to all the time
 oh  i somehow
 
no 
probably because this came to me at a certain time
when i was in my early teens maybe
so this one song kind of comes back to me more often than anything else
its not that i even seek it but somehow
one way or the other this song keeps coming back to me
is
how many times  
 okay okay i know you havent seen any of my films
but do you have a favorite film
 oh ive seen many good movies
at one time i saw a lot of them
ive not seen much of indian cinema
but i saw a lot of you know english cinema
but one movie that i thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed at that time
because on that day the way things happened
many life situations fell together and everything
was roman holiday
 oh 
well i have to say that thats the first film ive ever seen in my life
my mother took me to the cinema 
 here we are
 it is true
roman holiday is the first film i ever saw
it was my introduction to the big screen 
im glad i have something in common with you 
 that image of audrey and gregory peck is somehow just stayed with me 
 wonderful
 it was probably my age 
 yeah it must have been
something you enjoy doing and wish you had more time for
 i wish i had more time because
i made myself like this
that there is nothing that i enjoy or do not enjoy
i make sure i enjoy everything that i do
including simply sitting quietly or talking to somebody
or doing whatever because my activity is not limited to one area
so many things
if you did not enjoy everything that you do and do not do
you will go insane trying to manage so many things
but ill not go insane because i enjoy being alive
activity is
anything is okay
everything i do i enjoy 
small things big things every kind of thing
most profound things and silly things
i enjoy thoroughly  
 as should us all
lastly in a biopic made on you who would play you 
 but who would make a biopic first of all 
 no
there would be lots of interested people
 maybe you should animate 
 i dont think you would want that 
well that is the end of the rapid fire
and you totally deserve the hamper that doesnt exist on this platform 
but its a virtual hamper that ive given to you with my  love gratitude
and deepest amount of respect
thank you  
 thank you
 i think before we open questions to the house
its integral for me to share that
the last week that i spent reading about you and hearing everything that you had to say 
so many people question you including juhi  whos in the house 
its been exhilarating its been enlightening and more than anything else
i think it gave me a certain sense of understanding about where i am
being at a crossroad of my life emotionally
and also now as a newfound parent
i read some of what you had to say about even parenting
to me it was extremely enlightening to read that
that not to nurture the dos and donts so strongly on your child
we all have theories of parenting
but i think just what i imbibe from what you had to say is
that if i am strongwilled
and i exude a certain amount of pleasantness
and i give out the right amount of energies
my child and my children will emulate that imbibe that
and i dont have to constantly forcefeed that knowledge on them
they will imbibe it from my energy source in any case
that is what i drew with am i right
 no 
 okay
 see one level right
but its not question of energy and
dont dont make simple aspects of life mystical
because my entire life is dedicated to make mystical very approachable
but generally in the society
people are trying to make simple aspects of life mystical
rearing a child is not a mystical dimension of life
its
millions of people have done it
for thousands of generations people have done it
we are not reinventing anything here
its just a simple biological process
every creature does it
a bird is teaching its offspring to you know find a worm
and a worm is teaching its offspring to escape the bird
all kinds of things are happening in their own way
similarly human beings are doing it
but as we get more educated
we become more fussy about it
there was a time that a whole lot of parents had eightten children
they did not even know their names
number one number two they called them 
but they grew up somehow 
they just provided the basic ecosystem and they just grew up
so lets not make it too whatever because
you can easily
because today is a time of just one child or two children
and weve become totally
overly emotional about what is ours
and we lose perspective of what is the reality
a child will grow up anyway
if theyre nourished they will grow up
now what should they grow up as
should they grow up confused
should they grow up strong
should they grow up stable
should they become sagelike
should they become something else
thats a question
what they should become in the world is a social issue
that will be decided in the times in which they grow up and the exposure that they have
now you become a filmmaker
not because youre intrinsically a filmmaker
because you are in mumbai
you come from that kind of family and the atmosphere around you is like that
naturally you choose that
suppose you were somewhere else
lets say 1000 years ago you were somewhere else
would you be thinking of filmmaking
no you would be thinking of something else
so what we do in our lives is just a circumstantial thing
lets not read too much into it
the question is
when we have children how complete and joyful and wonderful are they
because every life is aspiring not to do this or that
every life is aspiring only to become a fullfledged life
thats all
whether its a worm insect or plant or tree
theyre only aspiring to become a fullfledged life
there is no other aspiration in life including ourselves
only problem with the human being is
we know what is a fullfledged worm
we know what is a fullfledged mango tree
but we dont know what is a fullfledged human being
this is the only problem
my work is just this
to make people perceive
not understand 
you must understand the difference or the distinction
between perceiving experiencing and understanding 
not understand but perceive and experience what it means to be a fullfledged life human being
and thats all that must happen to your children and every other children
every other child on the planet
what should happen
they must become fullfledged life thats all
for this
they need an ecosystem and nourishment
not teaching from another time
because you belong to an another time you are past
you may not like it
i am not saying as a director you are past
i am saying  in terms of time compared to your children you are past okay
so one important thing that we need to do when we have children is
no
to help them not to get overly identified with us
this is to make an investment 
heavy investment
child means 
but not expect any return
tch tch tch
this is difficult for a stock market world
how to make an investment without return
but this is what bringing up a child means
you want to make a heavy investment no return expected
this is all
if you want to
because i have
you know in raising my girl  i wont go into the lengthy affair 
but i made sure nobody teaches her anything
nor did i teach her anything
no onetwothree
no abc
no mary had a little lamb
because i dont care whether mary had a lamb or not  you know
people said sadhguru the way you are bringing up this girl
she wont know how many fingers she has
i said i dont care whether she knows how many fingers she has
as long as she knows how to use her fingers  
why should she know this is ten
she thinks this is hundred
actually this used to happen
when she was just
because i just exposed her to nature
as much as possible i expose
if there is nothing else at least i took her up on the terrace
and showed her the stars which you cant do in mumbai
you will show other kinds of stars in mumbai 
so she would look up at the sky and say 
she would call be by name first name and say 
jaggi ten
ten stars tch
because in her mind the biggest number is ten
somewhere she heard ten 
so she didnt say million
she said ten
i said yes ten
what is the problem whether ten stars or tenbillion stars
what is your problem
you think you are very knowledgeable because you know there are hundredbillion galaxies
in what way does it matter
whether there are hundredbillion or there are none
what way does it matter
because you are not seeing stars
you are only seeing the reflection in your mind isnt it
if you spend time to know the nature of what makes you experience all this
so she asked me once something
so i just told her just this
this is all you need to know about life
never look up to anybody
she looked at me like this 
i said not even me
because the value of me will be completely lost the day you look up to me
you must look at me just as i am
then you will see immense value for who i am
if you look up to me you will miss everything
and one day you want to hang me on your wall
as you did to everybody else to rama krishna buddha shiva everybody
you hung them on your wall
you will hang me also on your wall
you will miss the entire value
you missed all those guys now youll miss me also
you must look at me just the way i am
never look up to anybody
never look down on anybody this is all 
once you do not look up to anything or look down on anything
you will see everything just the way it is
if you see everything just the way it is
you will navigate your life
through life effortlessly
 thats true
that is simple theory and easy enough to live by 
thank you thank you sadhguru
with that i think i would like to open the questions up to the house
and i am sure we have a volley of questions which i can already see
hands going up in the air
i dont even know where to start okay yeah
 ive worked hard for this please
 sorry
 ive worked hard for this please
 youve worked hard for this okay then i suppose hard work should never go unfounded
 hello
 is there a mike that is circulating 
 okay you can shout it
 yeah if you have worked hard
you can scream loud 
yeah there you go
 namaste sadhguru and hi karan johar
i am thirtyone
i have kept myself single all my life so that i could accomplish
 no no you should go back there its it doesnt come to me the sound
 yeah
my name is rishabh i am thirtyone
ive kept myself single all my life so i could accomplish  something big
and you of all people should know how important and difficult it is
important because to accomplish something big
if youre single
it helps without added responsibilities on your shoulders
and difficult because
 i know you are trying to speak from your heart
but microphone works best here  
 i just didnt want to be too loud okay
and difficult because india
they keep asking you why you are still single
i would like to space dive
and i have talked to a million people about this
and i have knocked on a hundred doors
to turned down every single time
including the doors of isro 
 i cant hear a thing
 including the doors of isro
and they said they dont have enough funds
 its a very long question and we have not heard most of it
 i cant hear a thing actually
i am feeling incap
 yeah
 what is your question sir
 okay so my question is i would like to space dive
 you would like to space
 space dive
so its basically going all the way up to space
 you want to go to space
 okay
 and diving from there
 okay
 and tie what in space
 dive
 its space dive
 oh space dive
 yes
 oh you want to space dive
 yes
 okay
 so the thing is i have knocked on a hundred doors
only to be turned down every single time
because even isro turned me down saying they dont have enough funds
space dive is important because
india has gone leaps and bounds forward in space technology
but in the human space psychology its way back
my question to you sadhguru is
my biggest weakness is i like to live in danger
my question to you sadhguru is
where do i find an organization that will help me with the discipline
yoga and meditation thatll help me with this
 isha foundation
 and where do i find a person
most preferably a music movie director
theyll fund this project
understand the importance of it 
 hey you
 understand the importance of this project
that india needs a human space program
fund it and make a movie out of it
which has less drama
less songs and more of how a person struggles to get the mission accomplished
thank you very much
 okay we got the question
you took a long time to get to the question but
 he wants to space dive
he wants me to make a movie he want to  
 no no no he wants money 
 he wants money
my dearest thirtyone year old  thats all i heard
that you were thirtyone 
if i had money the last thing i would do is give it to you to space dive 
theres many things that i would do with that money
and yours is not on my bucket list
but would you like to answer his space diving
 the day after tomorrow
thats on fifth  day after tomorrow is
 is the sixth
 im sorry tomorrow tomorrow evening
tomorrow evening i am at the isro at sriharikota for the launch 
let me see if i can attach you to the rocket 
 thank you
yes
will you pass your mike on sir
 no no
 no
 the boy is very serious
 yeah he is very serious about this 
i don't know would you
 so about you being single 
you are sa
you have saved one life 
and i want to tell you
whether you space dive or you dont dive or you nosedive 
all of us are born single and we die single
tch in between what drama is you do is up to you
so you want to do a single act or a double act or a multiple act its up to you 
but essentially we are born single and we die single
and if you want to space dive
this is comic book stuff
it means nothing
do not waste your life
you are a young man
dont waste your life thinking
i want to space dive
i want to do this and karan is going to fund it
he made is very clear
he has other ideas for his money and i am glad 
 well you get married thats like space diving 
its the same thing
you dont know where you are going you are just diving 
yes 
thats true
 namaskaram
 namaskaram
 when i told my teenage daughter about this program
her immediate reaction was an excited wow
she is here with me and this program is everything we thought it would be
question for you karan 
what exactly inspired you to do this session with sadhguru
 whoa
 thank you maam
 he did not say he is inspired 
 i was
and the lady definitely has it right
it is because as i said somewhere that
there are many questions that i constantly seek answers for
i find myself in a dilemma between my emotions
between my fears
my anxieties
my tussle internally between my letting go of religion
and holding on to what i understand of spirituality
i havent been able to seek too many answers through the books i have read
or the people i have heard
to me sadhguru has been a revelation in more ways than one
because he made many of my answers
the answers that i was looking for resonate with my life
and i think eventually what we look for is deep resonance
and anything that you attach yourself to be  a spiritual energy
a god perhaps
a religion
you feel that you need to find answers within that resonance
and i felt that my life resonated with everything that you said
and everything that you professed
and thats why i was very interested and excited to be part of this platform 
yes sir im sorry
i was meant to go to you first
behind you hes sir
ill come back to you sir
the mike
 thank you
namaskaram sadhguru
hello karan
 hi
 there are two questions
if the first one is answered i dont need the second ones answer
this is a request 
can i please get a hug from you sadhguru 
 hey why dont you try him  
 why am i a second in that line 
 i didnt name the person
 what is your second question
the first is you want a hug second is what
you cant
dont go into a kiss then because  that might be detrimental
 no
just the presence of sadhguru for the first time in my life
i just dont want to miss it
i don't know when will i will get the chance next
so if i could just 
i know its a difficult one
 no no nothing difficult about it
it is just that i have been working with people to make them understand
people especially outside the country
and now unfortunately its caught up here
where is my hug sadhguru
can i get my hug
tch you are turning something beautiful into something very ugly
when you are in a certain state of inclusiveness
if it became necessary you embrace somebody
its a very beautiful act
now its a commodity where is my hug
its something  that you give and take
its not a transaction
this is what religion has done 
everybody hugs three times or four times or whatever number of times
this is not what it is
all the the tenderness that a human being feels within himself or herself
youre destroying it and make it into some kind of act
okay i will hug you
ill hug every one of you
what about it
sweat exchange 
so this is something we need to do
and people also
in india this happens
they grab my hand and
sadhguru bless me and they place it on their own head 
my
blessing will not come like this
blessing will come when you become receptive
when you are in a certain way
if its blessed something wonderful can happen out of it
something tremendous can happen out of it
you grab my hand and  
what is that blessing
and if you grab my hand or foot or you hug me forcefully
this is called molestation 
 all right
you got your jadu ki jhappi 
we had yes sir yeah
 hello namaskar sadhguru
i know a hug is not possible but you cook very good dosa
is that possible 
 certainly not here 
 i know
no my question is that when we cook
if we have to get joy  
joy of cooking
then that joy is something which is internal and i cook for my joy
but when you are cooking for others then you want to give them joy
and at times there is a conflict
who should win
 this is for him 
 no sir
 no no its for you only 
i have different things on my menu 
 see let us not make everything
this is the most fundamental thing about being spiritual
or spiritual process means just this
you essentially spiritual process means just this
that you live here like only you exist
nobody else but you
because you see everybody as yourself
and there is no issue
people ask me
sadhguru wherever you go
whether its 10000 people or 100000 people how do you speak
ah well i am talking to them like ive if at i
if i had the habit  i dont have 
if i had the habit of talking in front of my mirror
how i would speak to myself
thats how i am speaking
there is no
you you what i am doing is not some kind of oratory or discourse
i am just talking like i would talk to myself
because i dont see anybody but myself
so spiritual process means just this
that in some way you became all inclusive in your experience you became all inclusive
so one thing that has disappeared from your life is comparison and competition
comparison starts and then it transforms itself into competition
and then it goes into ugly things
so even for something as alive and as beautiful as joy
joy is 
joy is the most important aspect of your life you know
that is joy means your experience of you being
your existence is fantastic
your experience of your existence has become beautiful
thats why youre joyful
now i am not joyful because i make 
i make the best dosas not you okay  
not because i make the best dosas
nor will i be super joyful because i eat whatever the best things that you cook
before i come into your restaurant ill be very joyful
if you make something good i will eat joyfully
if you make something bad very joyfully i will push it aside
but with your good cooking or bad cooking you cant steal my joy
nor can you give my joy
i want you also and everybody in the world become like this
that somebody else cannot determine
what happens within you 
because
 yes maam
 you are
you are calling fundamental sense of slavery that you get into
with beautiful names
this is dangerous
so anyway people are saying wonderful things about your cooking
they have not said anything about you
but they have said wonderful things about your cooking
i would like to eat one day 
i dont know if i can afford it but 
 yes maam
well get a mike for you maam
 namaste sadhguruji my name is devika patel
and id like to ask you a question because youre a mystic
and even otherwise
please dont say i dont care
because many people out here im sure do
my question is what do you think of reincarnation
do you believe in it and if so
can you elaborate on the subject
and let us know what you were in your last birth
thank you
 now youve already put strictures on me 
as to what i should not say
for me
last three lifetimes have been same work
around the same place
and a few people handful of people same people
to such an extent
that sometimes by mistake i end up calling them by old names
but you should not believe all this nonsense 
no
because the moment you believe it
you will look at this person and little if they are friendly with you
oh maybe in my last life 
my past life
it is very good you dont remember a thing about anything
because in your present life
you are not able to handle the emotional tangles
and psychological involvements with people
if you remember ten lifetimes
you would break your mind
it takes an extraordinary sense of dispassion
to download many lifetimes of memory
and still not respond or react to those things
and simply see it for what it is
in your present state if such things happen
itll be a disaster
but anyway you should not believe these things
because you should not believe anything or anybody
you should not disbelieve them either
now in such a large crowd
i have a huge reputation of being very logically correct
and now youre making me say such stupid things
im staking my reputation
you must understand that i wouldnt make that mistake 
because i dont gain anything by talking about this
because you insisted that i should not dismiss it
but essentially what youre asking is 
let me translate this question for you
essentially what youre asking is 
when you say
is there a past life or is there a future life
what youre asking is
beyond this body is there something more
this is all youre asking
after my death or before my birth was there something else
this is the question or you are asking
what is the nature of my existence
well thats my fulltime business
to bring you to that experience as to what is the nature of your existence
you must come
you should not ask just a casual question here in mumbai and disappear
now you made me say illogical things in front of all these people
now you must invest some time to know what is the nature of your existence
otherwise its entertainment question 
 i dont know you have a color you like 
i dont know who to ask
 he is working hard but after him  i am afraid of hardworking 
 yes yes yes
hardworking in blue 
 can i have mike or can i speak like this
 no no no well get you a mike
we have just two questions after this gentlemen
 yeah yeah i am going to get there right there
 namaskaram sadhguru namaskaram karan sir
 please somebody give a mike to that lady
who is up there with her hand up after this boy is over yeah
 yeah yeah
 pranam sadhguru
my name is aishwarya nigam
and i have been to the ashram many times
and i have read many of your books
 you must quickly come to the question everybody is waiting
 the question is sadhguru
im stuck here i want you please guide me
tell me in a childs language what is the answer and what is the solution
i dont want to give importance to my own thoughts and emotions
tell me how
please make me understand 
i dont know when will i get this mike again
although im always in your presence
but i want the answer sadhguru
i dont want to  
 when you get out of this hall start walking south 
if its a genuine question
if its a question which truly matters you must seek
i would have gone to the ends of the world
if i found somebody who could answer the billion questions i had
if really it matters to you the question you must seek
if you think going south is the answer
if you dont think so you shouldnt bother with me
if you think so you shouldnt waste a moment of your life
because i want everybody to at least be straight and in
some basic integrity to your life
you ask big questions
and you leave it and go sit in the matinee show
tch
im not saying you should not go to the matinee
im sorry 
im saying the wrong things
wrong examples 
 thats fine
no offense taken 
 so i want you to understand
people somebody came and ask me recently
sadhguru are you a devotee of shiva
i said you fool
did you ever see me sitting somewhere and doing shiva pooja
did you see me
my entire bloody life
i have invested in you all right
there is nothing else i do
except constantly seeing how to raise people to the next step
and you are asking me am i devoted to somebody
im bloody devoted to you and you are not seeing it  
so when you ask this question
i take the question seriously i believe youre genuine
but then you go and get drunk today evening
i am not against any of those things
matinee or drink or this or that
all i am saying is you must have some integrity to your life
when you ask a big question
you must make the investment isnt it of time and energy
you must invest life because to bloody answer this
ive invested my entire life 
yes 
 sadhguru you had pointed out there was
yes to the lady right at the back
 that lady please 
 i have a question
 one moment sir
were just going to the lady and then well get
where who is that person
 here right
 she still doesnt have the microphone
he is on on it
 okay youre on the mike all right go ahead
 namaskaram sadhguruji my question is
what can be the greatest change one can bring to our life
to make it more blissful in this birth
 you got to change
 you have to
 you got to change i said 
 you got to change
 theres nothing else 
you think by doing something else this  will become blissful
no
this one  has to change to become blissful
 yes the lady has she got the mike
yes just reaching you maam
 namaskar to one and all
sir my question is
i get very attached easily
and now i feel im very attached to my responsibilities
so how do i break this bondage
and if i really want to do something for myself
not for anybody
just to feel the joy that ive been listening to you
if i want to really really feel that joy
how do you i break the bondage of responsibilities
and move ahead
and how do i overcome my attachments
 oh  i want you to understand that
responsibility is never a bondage
responsibility means you chose to respond to something wholeheartedly
so it is never a bondage
and how is it opposing your joy i dont understand
because to what extent you have the ability to respond
only to that extent you know life
if you lose your ability to respond
you become dead
in fact somebody is dead means theyve lost all ability to respond thats all it is
so dont ever think your responsibility is stopping you from being joyful
if you had no responsibilities 
many of you would be freaked to madness
you are fortunate you got something to dabble with
nothing to do ill keep you in a room
nothing to do ill feed you well
youll go crazy
you must be glad there are distractions for your madness
so you must understand this
if if your experience of life is such that
if you sit here you start enjoying your existence 
not your thought
not your emotion
not your action
your existence if you start enjoying 
you have a certain joy and blissfulness about your very existence
then all this jargon doesnt work
if that one thing has not happened to you
you are in a desperate condition
you have to do a million things to know a little bit of pleasantness
but tell me sincerely
genuinely
in a twentyfour hour segment
how many moments of actual joy do you know
most people can count on their fingers
many people have nothing to count
they will say
oh the day i got married i was so happy
the day i got my job i was so happy
it happened its history
because it is externally instigated
otherwise by yourself you will become a wreck
please change this
then all these jargons and philosophies are irrelevant to you
because you know the joy of your existence
 thank you 
we have one last question yes sir
 hmm haa haa
im just going from this gentleman
ill come to you
maybe two
yes
 sadhguru
 ill leave that to sadhguru
after this how many more hed like to answer  but yes
 sadhguruji namaskaram karanji namaskaram
 namaskaram
 im mohit saldana
ive come from karnal just to see you live and im feeling blissfully blessed
i didnt come with the question but now i have a question
sadhguruji you just made a mention that world does not know anything about you
and that remains a fact
even then any so body world who comes in little contact with you gets so much benefitted
so when would you reveal
or my question is what does it take to become a arjuna for the yogi of highest order of our times
our krishna the you to reveal 
sorry if that question is still invalid
 this is
this is difficult to articulate without sounding all wrong because
see everybody is working
or everybody is trying to live their life
with different frames that they have created for themselves
you can call this mindsets
you can call this framework
you can call this family
you can call this society you can call this ethics morals ideologies whatever
these are all frameworks you created
but you understand
a frame means you are putting a selfimposed limitation upon yourself
i can understand
he being a directorproducer
hes thinking of frames
because hes thinking of capturing something for doing something else
im asking you a simple question
do you want to capture this life 
or do you want to experience this life
hello
 experience
 you want to experience this life 
youre here to experience this life  and no other reason
everything else is secondary
when i say life
when i use the word life
most of you will think
oh my work family
my home my car my dog thats not life
these are all accessories to life
you added all these accessories believing that
with these accessories your life will get enhanced
but your money your wealth your family your relationships
these are all just accessories isnt it
the real thing is here 
never experienced
so to first make somebody
im you know therere many wonderful people around me
this is the biggest wealth i have
i have some truly absolutely fabulous people around me all the time
they wont let me pass through a single day
without tears of joy love ecstasy
without witnessing this a single day wont pass for me
no matter which part of the world i am in
i dont think theres better wealth in the world
in the physical world in the human societies than that
that constantly youre surrounded by people
who are shedding tears of love and ecstasy
having said that
their experience might have become beautiful by being in a certain presence
by realizing a few things
but still they still have frameworks
because very few individuals have the sense of
a total sense of abandon to be here without framework
as long as youre with the framework
we can add one drop here
one drop there
one more drop means itll break
so in my life
if 
by the time i fall dead
if i can share
maybe one or two percentages of what i have known
i think im very fortunate
because im still looking
ive not given up on it
there can always be one or two individuals wholl come up
we have been working on them
preparing them
so that somebody can exist here without any sense of frames
without any sense of what will be lost
there are many people around me
who you know
in every action that they do 
theyre not saying it verbally 
in every action that they do
they show that theyre willing to die for me
i keep reminding them in a thousand ways
dying for me is not the answer
that you are willing to allow this life  to happen in full flow
this is where the answer is
because only if youre a fullfledged life
can i share whats happening within me
otherwise im talking about extending your frames
giving you a different frame which is more difficult to manipulate 
but totally undoing the frames will need this
that you are a fullfledged life
when i say a fullfledged life
right now you have invested too much in your thought
too much in your emotion
you look up to something
you look down on something
you like something
you dislike something
in this state it cannot be done
i am working on people
o lots of them
and im also scanning the world
because there could be s
anybody somewhere
because that will be a blessing
not to me but to the world
if if there can be human beings not one
if there can be a thousand human beings on this planet
or if can be 10000 human beings
or a million human beings
who are just life
no bull
just life
because this is the only thing that youre aspiring for
you may think you want money
you may think you want pleasure
you may think you want something 
no
you are only wanting to having a larger slice of life somehow isnt it
thats all there is
because that is all there is
you think money will get that
education will get that
love will get that
pleasure will get that
but essentially you want a larger slice of life
so if you want in slices
we will cut it and serve it
because we have to keep you going
otherwise youll run away 
but i want to see you
a day when i can throw life at you just like that
without making slices out of it
that would be a great day
make it happen 
because i want to change
i want to change the perception of what is street
if you say street
if you use the word street
people will think booze
people will think drugs
people will think prostitution
all the ugly things
if we do the right things
in the next twenty twentyfive years
we can change this
that street means beauty
street means love
street means meditativeness
street means spiritual process
street means the highest things
we can do this if we are willing
we have the tools
we have the means
why im saying this is never before
many great beings have come
but nobody had the means that we have today
a krishna came
a gentle being 
when he spoke only one man heard
yes
and another man overheard 
when adiyogi shiva came
only seven people heard
today we have the ability
we can sit here and speak to every human being on the planet
never before this was possible
now we have such an ability to communicate
if we do not communicate the right things
we are committing a crime against humanity
so when we have this kind of power to communicate
whatever is the highest dimension of life should become street
i
my essential work is this
to bring down spirituality from mountaintops to street 
thats why my language is little street 
 not at all with that
im sorry we wont be able to take any more questions
weve reached the end of this conversation with the mystic
and thank you sadhguru
thank you for your words your wisdom 
and everything that you always bring  to the energy table of our universe
thank you so much its truly been an honor
thank you
and thank you to all of you for being a wonderful audience
thank you
