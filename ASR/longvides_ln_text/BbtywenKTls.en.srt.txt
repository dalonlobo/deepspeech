sadhguru chants jananam sukhadam
 good evening everyone
 good evening namaskar and a very warm welcome to all of us here
it is indeed an honor and a real privilege sadhguru
to have you with us for the next ninety minutes
during which time i shall do my best
and we will explore i think a variety of concepts with sadhguru
concepts around leadership ethics individual responsibility
a little bit of questions around spirituality and so on
so without further ado
i want to start off by asking you sadhguru
what is the next step for sadhguru
  dinner
 dinner 
i thought that was already over
so we expect a more profound answer from you 
 its a very profound answer 
because you can postpone many things in your life
you can postpone buying a home buying a car
you can postpone your wedding if you want
it's a good thing 
you can postpone your divorce
good to postpone your death
but you cant postpone your dinner 
right now this is the ugliness which is happening in this country
a whole lot of people are postponing their dinner today
this is the horrible situation thats happening
so do not consider dinner as not so profound its very profound
if you are eating ten times a day its not profound
if you are eating once or even twice a day
it is quite profound 
 so you say something which is you know
which is very close to my heart
you talked about dinner we
 no no
dinner is about my stomach not my heart 
 okay well well get to the heart through your stomach 
you know we live in a world of contrasts
at least as i perceive it you know
there is obviously the rich and the poor
there are the ones who are impoverished and the satiated
you know we live in a country where three hundred million people go to bed hungry every night
how do we deal with these big social issues
and what is the one message that you would like to give to all of us
where we as individuals can make our own little big whatever contribution
to being part of the solution
rather than waiting for somebody else to do something
 now youre immediately getting into the missionary mode 
 we can try a little bit of that
 yes its a serious problem and an unfortunate problem
because we are living in a land
which has over 12000 years of agricultural history
probably the only place on the planet like this
as far as i know except a few other places in south america
nowhere else on the planet was agriculture organized 12000 years ago
so we have enormous experience of agriculture
which means the science of producing food
and we are living in a land where twelve months of the year
you can grow what you want
many farmers in tamil nadu take six crops
four crops actually but in between the inter cropping
totally six products they are taking out of the same piece of land
 right
 nowhere else on the planet this is really possible
in spite of this half the people are hungry
simply because of apathy
not because of lack of food
not because that it is not possible to fulfill this
i feel a focused effort
in a matter of five years five to eight years
very comfortably we can crest this
it should not even take that much time
but if we are determined
within five years time it is possible to cross this
and its important to cross this
because when you say india
i know lot of poetry has been written about how beautiful it is
our mountains our rivers our whatever
but for 125 billion people
you neither have enough mountains nor rivers
nor land nor even a piece of sky believe me
the only thing that you have is people
if these people are wellnourished competent inspired
this can be the greatest miracle
but right now sixty percent of indias population
even their skeletal system has not grown to full size
or in other words
we are producing a totally underdeveloped humanity
if your body does not grow to its full size
neither will your brains
theres medical evidence to show that first four years of your life
if you did not get the necessary nourishment
your brain is approximately sixty percent of what it should be
so with halfbrained people
the next generation
what nation are you going to build
youre going to be a big disaster
if you dont fix nourishment
we are going to be an enormous disaster
its waiting
its a silent bomb it doesnt make noise
very quietly its going to implode upon us
so this is something that has to be fixed on a war footing
must be
 so what is the role
i know all of us as individuals have a role to play
we are all part of a corporate
an academic institution
part of a community and a society
so what do you believe is the responsibility
im not talking about corporate social responsibility
im simply talking about corporate responsibility
when it comes to being part of fixing some of the problems
that youve just spoken about
  ive you know
we are very much involved with nourishment education health of the rural populations
ive been talking to many leading lights
not much light out there 
whenever i speak to a lot of people
not all of them many of them
if i tell them
you know we are planting hundred and fourteen million trees
you could do something
theyll say
theyll tell me a very passionate story
how they his wife or his mother has a trust
where she planted one hundred and eight trees around their factory
and how they have grown
how beautiful they are and how its
how they are enjoying it
in all this passion i just  okay
whats there to say
hundred and eight trees are good
im not saying no
but if your capacity was only hundred and eight i am ill bow down to you
your capacity is hundred and eight million not hundred and eight
but you are satisfying yourself with hundred and eight
you talk about nourishment
you say you know what my maids children
they were so malnourished
three of them every sunday we feed them 
these kind of stories ive heard of great compassion and love 
so there is a whole culture of doing something for your satisfaction
or doing something because you want to buy a ticket to heaven
i want people to come to a place
where you being fulfilled should happen within you
if you want to go to heaven please leave 
but if you want to be a solution theres another way to work
i fed two children and i feel very happy
its all right i appreciate that
im glad for those two children but this is not a solution
this is only for satisfaction
so its time at least those people who are in a certain level of capability
i would say
when i say capability all of you will thinking
oh okay some big corporate leader
im saying all of you are in a certain level of capability
who should see how to bring a solution
not do something for your silly satisfaction
you can be satisfied by eating food
by simply sitting quietly
by sleeping well doing whatever
satisfaction need not come through somebody elses suffering
you dont have to fulfill your satisfaction because of this
you know somebody is suffering
that is not the basis of your suffering
and if you buy a ticket to heaven through that suffering
i dont know heaven will turn into hell probably for you 
i hope it does 
 i couldnt agree with you more 
so i want to explore two or three other dimensions that you spoke about
you spoke about capacity
you spoke about leadership
so talk to us a little bit about what you see as
what are
who are leaders and what is leadership
is there a difference is it
 i know theres a lot of talk about leadership
and wanting to become leaders
i dont think anybody should try to become a leader
its quite obscene that
i want to become a leader
that means all of you should be what
i dont know
i know what you would like to call yourself 
its not about you wanting to become a leader
or someone want to be wanting to become a leader
because of a certain thing that you have done within yourself
or a certain level of observation
or a certain intelligence or a certain experience
you are able to see something that most people are not able to see
the moment you are able to see something
then people will naturally look up to you as a leader
because you are seeing something that they cannot see
and if you become a leader
there are many ways to become a leader 
you can get elected
you can get selected
you can work it
you can pull other people down and become a leader
or simply people will rise you as a leader
because they see that either you are able to see something
or you are able to do something
which they themselves cannot do
i feel this is the way leadership should happen
if you want to call it that
that someone is able to see something and do something that others cannot do
so everybody wishes he must take charge of the situation
because naturally he will be able to do something that the others will not be able to do
so what is the quality of leadership
leadership means
once you sit on a perch
you better see clearer than others
otherwise you will make a ridiculous fool of yourself 
theres a whole you know in the nation
certain things have been happening
somebody sits on a perch and he doesnt see any better than you
he looks like a fool immediately
so it is not about you wanting to sit on the perch
you wanting to see something must get you to the perch
not because you want to be above everybody else you get to the perch
so what is the quality of a leader
i dont think theres any particular quality
one thing is
a leader means his sense of life is beyond himself
its not about
his sense of identity is beyond himself
somebody becomes a leader because he is willing to think and feel and act
for more people than himself
if you act for yourself you are called selfcentered
if you just act for the sake of two or three people you gather in the form of family
you are named as dhritarashtra
there are modern names for that
if you identify yourself with the entire nation or the world
you will be looked at in a different way
essentially
your leadership will come from the right context
depending upon what you are identified with
because everybody needs an identity
what sort of identity have you taken
will determine the context and the quality of your leadership
 in that context
isnt leadership something that you know
each of us can individually manifest
if i were to describe one dimension of leadership
as saying it is about taking ownership to create a better outcome
in that context
you know we can convert leadership from a noun to a verb
 i dont know that much grammar okay 
 but you can try
 see whatever we do
every human activity
the purpose of an activity is to produce something
production may be a safety pin a computer love joy health wellbeing
it doesnt matter what
we want to produce something
when we act we want it to be effective
how small an act or how big an act is not the important 
we want something to happen effectively
which means its a question of efficiency
its a question of with how little
how much more you could do
thats what makes you
because all of us have the same amount of time in a day
people always tell me
sadhguru you had such a long day
i said unfortunately theres no long day god you know
they give me only twentyfour hours
i would like to bargain for more but its not happening 
you can you can make it more by increasing your efficiency
the way you function
including people as a part of yourself
where other people will function as a part of you
so that you dont have to bother about so many things around you
in this sense you can enhance what you do
but timewise all of us have the same time we cant help it
so how much can you produce in how little time in how little material is the question
in the limited span of time which we have as life
what is it that we can do
is it just about efficiency
is it about simply mindless efficiency
do better do better no
at different times in history
people seem to want different things on the surface
but essentially
no matter which time of history who they are
which part of the world they are
everybody wants the same thing  wellbeing
but their idea of wellbeing
everybody has their idea how to get there
but everybody wants wellbeing
no question about that
it doesnt matter which part of the world you go
whether you came here thousand years ago
or today or hundred years later
you will see people will be still seeking wellbeing
in pursuit of wellbeing maybe hundred years ago
somebody would be going in search of water
today you are going in search of the wifi cloud 
but still wellbeing
peoples idea of wellbeing
whatever that is
but people are only well only when something beautiful happens within themselves
they think theyre going to cause it to themselves by some means
but people have been happy before the wifi came
people have been happy before the automobile came
people have been happy before all the luxuries we are enjoying today appeared
so what im saying is
wellbeing if you are in pursuit of wellbeing
essentially it is about what happens within the human being
what happens within the human being in the name of so many things
i dont want to name all the things
in the name of so many things
what we call as family society
and another world which we call as corporate world 
all these things we created
these are all different names or different mechanisms
that we believe will bring wellbeing to us
somebody built a family
somebody built a corporation
both in pursuit of wellbeing isnt it
i must tell you this
the first time i was at davos many years ago
they were almost resentful
why what is a mystic doing in economic summit 
i and a particular ceo who was running
was in charge of a top computer manufacturing company
three months later they got sold out to the chinese 
  we can guess who they were 
 so he was very resentful
what are you doing here
then i told him see whats your business
he said i do computers
i said see whether you manufacture a computer or a safety pin or in between anything
fundamentally this is about human wellbeing
the basic business is human wellbeing
you may do it through your computer
somebody will produce safety pin
somebody will produce a cloth
somebody will produce something else
it doesnt matter what youre doing
the fundamental business is human wellbeing and thats my business too
thats why im here 
 so sadhguru youve talked about wellbeing
ive you know one of the things that you say is
its all about how the body mind emotions and most importantly
energy come together
and i think youve said it very eloquently
which says you know when the body is feeling pleasant we call it health
if it is feeling very pleasant we call it pleasure
and so on and you go on to say
 you can you can go all the way
 sorry
 you can go all the way
 i can go all the way 
so when the mind is feeling pleasant we call it joy
when it is feeling very pleasant we call it peace
when the you know when the emotion is feeling pleasant we call it love
when it is feeling very pleasant we call it compassion
when the energy is feeling pleasant we call it bliss
and when it is very pleasant we call it ecstasy
 youre a very good student 
 so so here is the question
can you just elaborate on what you really mean
what is the difference between bliss and ecstasy
you know for
for people who are not mystics what does
 oh 
  what does it look like
 i think i need to clarify this accusation of being a mystic 
on a certain day
two cows were grazing on the english meadow
english cows
 got it 
the thomas hardy kind
 one cow said to the other
what is your opinion about the mad cow disease
the other one said i dont care a hoot im anyway a helicopter 
so what a mystic means is
that there is no mistake about his perception as to who he is 
 okay 
 so there are only two kinds of people
mystics and mistakes 
 thats an easy one to remember
 so a mystic did not fall from somewhere else
strived to pay attention to simple aspects of life
very simple things
very simple things means extremely simple things
just
right now how do you know that you are here
what is the basis im asking
 i am talking with you
 even when youre not speaking you still know that you are here right
 yeah
 so how do you know
 im perceiving
 what
 that i am in this place
there is an audience here we are in conversation
 no even if you close your eyes you are still here right
 i have a mindfulness im attentive to the fact that im in conversation im conscious
 you are conscious
 im conscious
 the reason that you know that you are here is because youre conscious
how do you know that you have a body
 because i can move my hand 
 so many things can move
 but i am causing my hand to move
 fine even if you dont move you know its there right
how do you know
because there is sensation in the body right
 yeah yeah
 if no sensation in your body you wouldnt know
whether its here or not
no consciousness you wouldnt know whether you are here or not
 right
 yes
 yeah
 so these are taken for granted things
if you pay little attention to these things
you will see theres a whole world out there
theres a whole existence by itself
just your sensation
if you pay enough attention
you know the nature of your physical existence
if you pay attention to what youre calling as my consciousness
you know the nature of your basic existence
once you know the nature of your existence
that is when you can use this  gadget well
im calling this  a gadget
because human mechanism is the most sophisticated mechanism on the planet
we are on top of the evolutionary heap not for nothing
its taken millions of years to manufacture you
yes
 yeah
 not not a simple process
an enormous process has happened to get you to this level of neurological sensitivity
sensations awareness everything
so these are the keys of your existence
but everybody is reading a book or theyre looking into
theyre looking at the cosmos through their iphone
nobody is paying attention  to this 
because this  is the basis of your existence
only if you know this 
you can employ this  to its fullest capability
even if you take your cell phone the more you know about it
the better you can use it isnt it
the same with this 
so what this whole unnecessarily exaggerated
exaggeration is not the word
unnecessarily decorated thing about selfrealization means is
you know more about this 
or you know everything thats worth knowing about this 
that means you can use this  whichever way you want
if you want to sit still here for the rest of your life you can sit
if you want to jump out and be active you can do
if you want to do this and that together you can do
whatever you want you can do because you know the mechanism fully
in its entirety not just the physicality of it
but its entirety
so if you know this 
suppose your body happens as per your instruction
your mind happens as per your instruction
your life energies happen as per your instruction
how will you keep it
pleasant or unpleasant
 pleasant
 pleasant at least for yourself highest level of pleasantness
what you want for your neighbor may be debatable 
but what you want for yourself is clear
so when you main when you want pleasantness
now generally if you are very pleasant we say you are blissful
now bliss can get boring sometimes okay 
yes
 good to know that
 pleasantness gets boring isnt it sometimes
you want some slosh to happen
now you use ecstasy 
but that slosh cannot be kept up
bliss can be kept for your entire life
ecstasy cannot be kept for your entire life
you go up and you come down
or in other words bliss is a sustainable level of pleasantness
the height of pleasantness
ecstasy is not sustainable but you can hit it often enough
at least a few times in a day you must hit it
 you know in the spirit of a freewheeling conversation
im reminded of a film i saw about 
i think it was fifteen years ago the film was made 
which was a series of conversations with quantum physicists and some mystics
to use that word
and the whole premise of the film was
that the mystic and the quantum physicist is seeking an answer to the three basic questions
which are who am i where have i come from and where am i going
i did not understand the film then 
i am hoping that you would be able to throw some light
on the three questions and you know
what the physicists and the mystics are seeking
 so you are asking me who you are 
 kind of
  see its all right to walk on the street
point at one of you and say who are you
its okay
you go to somebody and say who am i 
this happened in the cincinnati airport
people had lined up to check in at the checkin counter
one man came briskly jumped the line
went straight to the counter and thrust his ticket
the lady at the counter said
sir there is a line please
he said no no im in a hurry
well she said everybody is in a hurry
you are all getting on the same plane
so please stand in the line
then he raised his voice do you know who i am
she looked at him promptly picked up the microphone and said
there is a man here who does not know who he is
can somebody help him please 
so you should never address this question to someone else 
all this socalled whatever
i dont know i dont want to make comments
they all picked it up because
that ramana maharishis book i think became famous in california okay
everywhere you go everybody is talking
who am i who i who are you
who am i is a question that should be addressed within you
digging every time you ask it digging it deeper and deeper and deeper into yourself
you never go and ask somebody who am i
that smacks of something else
i was  i was teaching a program in los angeles
and this is of
like maybe hundred and fifty two hundred people
half of them all are hollywood types
and a whole lot of them look alike many especially women
not because they are sisters
because they have the same doctor 
and i am teaching them an extremely simple process that they need to do every day
which is just twentyone minutes
extremely simple
just that
they are saying
sadhguru youre teaching us all these things
but ramana maharishi said you dont have to do anything
tch ohh ramana came all this way from thiruvannamalai 
i said yes he is absolutely correct
you dont have to do anything and he did nothing
he simply sit
sat in one place like this  fourteen years
rats came and bit into his thighs
festering wounds worms came out of it but he did nothing
simply sat
i said you people are made like this
if a mosquito bites you youll call 911 
you dont talk about doing nothing 
i said ramana talks about doing nothing leave that thats not your business
you are made like this
you dont talk about doing nothing
ramana talked about who am i who am i
you never utter this to anybody
dont ever go and
please all of you 
dont go somewhere and ask them someone who am i
you can ask them who are you 
so who am i is not even a question that you need to articulate
when i just said the more you know about it
the better you can exist here
not necessarily
dont always think about a human being like he is some kind of a machine
how much he has to produce theres no such thing
but how he exists is important
when you sit here
how are you within yourself is important
what you wear may be socially important
what you drive may be important somewhere else
what you what kind of home you live in may be important for some other reason
but existentially theres only one thing important
how are you within yourself
are you pleasant or unpleasant every moment of your life
in twentyfour hours how many moments of pleasantness
how many moments of unpleasantness
and how much support does it need to keep you pleasant
thats the question
right now in pursuit of human wellbeing
weve ripped the planet apart
and still wellbeing is not happening
comfort has happened convenience has happened
wellbeing for sure has not happened isnt it
as a generation of people
we are the most comfortable generation ever
never before anybody could even imagine these things
but we cannot say we are the most joyful or blissful or ecstatic generation
no
are we worse than others
i dont believe so
every generation  same nonsense
some people lived fantastic within themselves
others went through all the nonsense they had to go through
this is not because of whats happening to them
see there are two kinds of suffering
physical pain can happen to you because somebody may cause something to you
somebody has no food the
youre in a war zone or somebody is poking you
im asking all of you  in the last twentyfive years
how many times it happened to you somebody took a knife and poked you
for most of you it didnt happen
maybe when you are in in your school
somebody poked you with a pin at the most
or you were not even worth that nobody poked you 
 they simply poked fun
 hmm
 they simply poked fun at you
 whichever way
physically how many times suffering entered you from outside
very very minimal
rest is all selfhelp 
you know in tamil nadu the government has a scheme
namakku name 
namagae naavae  it means
that means people are on selfhelp busy
causing suffering to themselves daily   sit stand whatever happens
see you will see people most of them are driving their dream machines on bangalore streets all right
how many are driving joyfully
if we if the traffic light takes ten more seconds
they are freaking in their dream machine 
is it not a blessing that you bought this dream machine
after working for whatever number of years
why dont you
the traffic is making sure you stay in your dream machine for a little longer
whats your problem 
i am saying just about anything people are suffering
so suffering is not happening
because of something else
its simply because people do not know
how to manage their body their mind their energies their emotion nothing
because no attention has been paid
no attention to the nature of who you are has not been paid
so who you are who am i question is internally
entirely internalized question
never to be uttered never to be written down
unfortunately somebody printed it and the whole world is talking
who am i
who am i 
you 
this is okay if youre a  inpatient
if youre an inpatient in nimhans 
you ask who am i  thats allowed
thats allowed
if you are out on the street you are not allowed to ask who am i 
you get me 
 youve also talked about
 no there are other two questions in that 
 yes yes yes im waiting for those two questions
 where are you going 
theres only one way to find out you must go and see 
as i was saying just now
some things are best known only by experience
people want to know
after my death what will happen
i tell them you must know by experience 
are you ready
no
then dont worry wait 
where did i come from
see essentially what you are asking is
all three three questions put together
you are asking what is the nature of my existence
am i this body
am i this
am i that
what am i
what is the nature
because whichever way you look at it you can prove im that
because for everything theres some substance
you can prove yourself to be a woman
you can say im not this im a human being
you can say im just a piece of life
you can say im god
somebody may think you are something else
doesnt matter 
but for everything there is some substance
so you can argue for it but thats not the point
really what is the nature of your existence
dont take this as some kind of a great philosophical or spiritual question
please see it as a practical thing
if you want to know how to use this camera well
the more you know about it the better it is
you agree with me
hello
 yes
 similarly if you want to use this 
if you want to use this human being properly
the more you know about it the better it is
so selfrealization is a very practical thing
not an esoteric thing
what you think is esoteric is
all the things that you dont have an understanding of
you want to make it esoteric
or you want to make it mystical
lets understand this word mysticism or mystical
anything that you dont understand will look mystical to you isnt it
suppose you dont know whats electricity
you have no concept of that
now i press something here  boom lights come on
very mystical for you isnt it
see if i just had a light bulb a thousand years ago
i could have claimed i am god and it would have worked
tch came too late you know 
so the more you know about it the better you will live
this is not something that you seek at the end your life
this should be the first step of your life
if you value your life
yes
knowing this  should be the first step of your life
very beginning of your life this question should be asked
can i tell you a story
 please
 there was a
a bishop in the greek catholic order
the greek orthodox church believes they are the only real christians
others are not really christians
they think they are the only pure christians
others are not really that
they have their own pope in istanbul
so it became a very small group over a period of time  for whatever reasons
so being on the silk route
many fantastic stories from india are wafting across the bosporus
and these stories are going on about the mystics and the yogis and the magic of india
which the indians have not seen and everybody else has seen 
so he always wanted to go to india
but being a man of cloth he could not really choose where to go
after sixty years of age
when his when he is semiretired
he got an opportunity and he came to southern india
and he found the right kind of guides
somebody told him you go up this mountain
and they gave him the landmarks and
here theres one yogi he is the right one to meet for you
so he climbed up the mountain
the man is not made for mountains you know
mountains demand certain things from you 
so he went up and as they had said there was a yogi
sitting in front of a cave blissed out
he went and he had heard that if you see a indian yogi you have to prostrate
tch but for that also you need some fitness
this is a part of the indian thing because thats the only exercise most indians do 
so whatever you see you just bow down
but now they have learnt  
 a short cut there too
 yes the idea is to touch the floor
every time every time you keep doing it through the day
its a good exercise you dont have to spend extra time for exercise
so he struggled and scraping himself and sat up
all this commotion
the yogi opened his eyes and smiled
so the bishop asked
can i ask you a question
the yogi said by all means
the bishop asked what is life
tch this is after sixty 
the damn question you should have asked when you were six
at least sixteen you must have asked
no sixty all right better late than never
some time you asked
so when he asked this question what is life
the yogi went into raptures and then he said
life
life is like the fragrance of jasmine upon gentle spring breeze
the bishop looked like this 
what
fragrance of jasmine on gentle spring breeze
but our teacher told us
life is like a thorn
once it gets into you if you sit it hurts if you lie down it hurts
if you stand up it hurts 
and you are saying it is fragrance of jasmine spring breeze and all this stuff
the yogi smiled and said
well thats his life 
so we have never paid attention to the most important dimension of who you are
and you do not know life any other way than the way it happens within you
yes
you are the only doorway to the existence for yourself
you can only experience through this mechanism and no other way
if you dont know this 
what the hell are you doing here
and just because you know this 
people label you as a mystic as this
he is that and many people mispronounce it 
as a mistake you know 
 so one of the other things that youve talked about is
you know the mind
what and these are my words what ive understood of what youve said
you know what the mind believes the heart follows
you know what is in the mind is in the heart
 no no
 in a sense if ive got it right
unless ive got it wrong
and you know because when you say that there is no difference between you know
my mind is saying this but my heart is saying is something else
 youre talking about a metaphoric heart or your heartheart
 i am talking about metaphoric
 okay
 im not talking about
 okay not the pump
 im talking about metaphoric heart not the heart that is you know simply pumping
there is something else you know
which ive read some time back which says that
you know youve got to search in your heart with your intellect
so there are all these things which is about the mind and the heart
and you know how you apply intelligence and perception
to create awareness
and i think youve talked about that a little bit
would you elaborate for us you know the concept of intellect
intelligence
perception and you know
how we can use that in our everyday lives
 see theres whole lot of enterprise going on in the world
by complicating very simple aspects of life
really 
if you complicate something with incomprehensible words
and if you have lot of words to do it
then you will seem profound because anyway
nobody can understand what the hell it is 
so searching your heart with your intellect
the thing that you are referring to as your heart
is generally the emotional side of you
so youre separating what is thought and what is emotion
let me ask you a simple question
if you look at yourself carefully in your daytoday activity
you will notice this
the way you think is the way you emote
right now if i think you are such a wonderful person
i will have sweet emotions towards you
 which i hope you are thinking 
 this is not a confession 
if i have if i think she is horrible ill have nasty emotions towards you
i cannot think you are wonderful and have nasty emotions towards you
i cannot think you are horrible and have sweet emotions towards you
it is impractical and its not possible
people act those things and it never works
people  i hate her but ill be nice to her
they will go like this  and do like this   you know
have you seen this happening
 yes
 nice things are done in a horrible way 
it is happening in families among friends whatever
nice things are done in such a horrible way
if you want to do something horrible just do something horrible at least
dont spoil the nice things in a horrible way 
so now the question is just this
thought and emotion are they same
or are they two different realms
they are not
thought is agile
see today i can think right now i think you are wonderful
to just next moment you did something i dont like i think you are horrible
my thought immediately changes because it is agile
but my emotion is sappy itll take three days
itll struggle and slowly turn around
it has a larger turning arc but after three days
itll come my way
for some people its three days some people three months but they will turn around isnt it
yes or no
the way you think is the way you feel there is no other way
it is also true the way you feel is the way you think also
it depends which is more dominant in you
in a person if emotion is forefront the way they feel is the way they think
if thought is forefront the way they think is the way they feel
you cant think one way and feel another way
that only happens temporarily for some time but emotion will catch up
 so sadhguru what is a creative mind
 oh how big an answer do you want
 as big as you want it
 see the english word mind doesnt say anything
because its just one generic word
which does not describe different dimensions of what the mind is
mind is not just one something sitting here  and doing something okay
there is really no such thing as mind
in the yogic culture there is no mind
there is a physical body
there is a mental body
because what you are calling as mind right now
is a certain combination of memory and intelligence
there is memory in your body
more memory in your body than you can imagine
if i have to get at you again its okay
im picking on you
you definitely dont remember how your greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandmother looked like
but her nose is sitting on your face right now
yes
 yes
 you dont remember a thing consciously
but your body remembers one hundred percent
how ten generations ago
your grandmother was your body still remembers
a million years ago how your forefathers were
your still your body remembers isnt it
its not forgotten and its not going to forget
your mind is not capable of this kind of memory
your body has a trillion times more memory than your socalled brain
this whole shift towards the brain and intellectual process
is a european malaise
they gave too much significance to thought
this has happened because they lived under a subjugated society
religiously subjugated society where you are not supposed to think anything except
whats written in some book otherwise you are dead
they lived like this for a longtime
because of this when they got little freedom to think and managed to live
they started celebrating their thought too much
lets understand the context of thought
you can only think from the data that you already have gathered
that means you can never think anything new
you can recycle it
you can rehash it
you can produce permutations and combinations of it
but you cannot think something absolutely new
it is not in the nature of the thought to come up with something new
it can only recycle the past
that means if you dedicate yourself to your thought process
if you enshrine your thought process
you are ensuring nothing new ever happens in your life
so thought need not be celebrated like this
thats why in this culture
thought is never been given so much significance
what you think is your psychological drama
we dont think much about that 
because its your drama
your drama is important for you
somebody elses drama its important for them
everybody thinks their drama is the most important drama in the universe
this is everybodys experience
because they are so identified with their own psychological drama
this psychological drama should not determine the nature of your life
because this is just a small happening compared to the life process
life is a much deeper intelligence than intellect
we can look at
the yogic system looks at the mind as sixteen parts
those sixteen parts are further broken
and theyre taken up to 84000 parts
but now if i talk about 84000
already theres a segment which says no
so i will make it four
i am taking away eighty okay
im being fair to you 
only four
four fundamental parts
one is the intellect which we have
in modern world in todays world
we are unnecessarily giving too much significance to intellect
and we will pay an enormous price for this
you will come to a place where youll know everything
but youll know nothing of life significance
really
today you will see this happening to children
for the first time this generation you see
ten elevenyearold or twelveyearold children
they look bored
when you were teneleven you did not what is boredom it was not possible
it was too exciting to be alive and looking around
you will see ten twelveyearold children
all looking bored
because theyve seen the cosmos through their phone screen
they know it all
and especially in the western countries
you will see this happening at eightten
they are really bored you will see in the school buses
they are all sitting like this  
bored
because by the time you are twelve
you already had one love affair
you know what is a break
you know how to all this recover from that
you tasted alcohol
youve seen this
probably youve gone into all kinds of physical things
and you know the cosmos
what more
by the time youre fifteen theres really no purpose for you to exist for many of them
you should not be surprised
if this culture continues 
im not saying this as a prediction
it is something that i see beginning to happen
in another fifty or hundred years time
if twentyfive to fifty percent of the people commit suicide
you should not be surprised
because life needs some exuberance
if too much information happens to you without experience
that exuberance will be gone and a sense of
false sense of knowing becomes so strong in you
this is the danger of intellect because
intellects wants to intellect wants to dissect everything
intellect is like a scalpel  the sharper it is the better it is
it wants to dissect and know
dissection works with some things
not with all aspects of life
if you want to know the poor frog you know
you remember tch
the poor frog that you crucified and cut and great knowledge
you acquired from all that torture is unbelievable 
how much knowledge you know
for the torture that that frog went through
how much knowledge you have acquired is quite unbelievable
all that you got to know
now youve got interest
suddenly you got interested
the mother that you had ignored
you want to know your mother today
please get yourself a sharp knife
start the dissection
you may know everything about her liver kidney heart
but you wont have a mother left thats all
so life cannot be known by breaking it up
you can know physical things by breaking it up
you cannot know life by breaking it into pieces
but this is the nature of the intellect
the whole modern science has evolved from human intellect
because its produced technological benefits
you cant argue against it
because people you know 
they they think they are scientists
they know nothing about science
theyre just enjoying their iphone
they think they are scientists because they can do this 
no
technology is fine its brought much comfort and convenience
but itll not bring life to us
so intellect is like this
intellect will be useful only depending upon
what it is identified with and what is held
what holds this how steadily
so the next dimension of the mind
the first one is called as buddhi which is the intellect
the second one is called as ahankara
ahankara does not mean ego this that it means the identity
whatever youre identified with your intellect functions only around that
simple if you just identify with a nation
if you say im an indian everything indian looks beautiful
if you cross the border and you say you are something else
all that looks beautiful
so whatever youre identified with its only with that the intellect functions
so ahankara is the identity
how consciously and how steadily your ahankara has been created
will determine the effectiveness of your intellect
just because its sharp
it does not mean itll be effective
because sharp intellect or a sharp knife can cause any amount of damage to you
if you have a sharp knife
and you dont have a steady hand
you will cut yourself all over the place
thats all thats happening
human suffering is just this
you dont know how to hold this intellect in your hand properly
every day youre cutting yourself
self
all suffering is on selfhelp because
your own mind causing this to you all the time
no matter what happens people suffer whichever way they suffer
because they dont know how to hold this intellect
if you had the mind of an earthworm you would be quite peaceful
yes 
youre trying to do it in so many ways to reduce the sharpness of the intellect
by drink by drug by overeating by doing all kinds of things
somehow to take away the sharpness
because the damn thing hurts
it hurts not because thats its nature
it hurts because you do not know how to hold it
the next dimension of the mind is called as manas
which is a huge volume of memory
it is not here or there entire body carries memory
so manomayakosha this is called
a huge sack of memory
this memory is in various stacks
well not go into all these details
considering some people have said a clear no
they dont want to have a mind
im sorry they dont want to know anything about the mind 
so the fourth dimension of the mind is called as chitta
chitta means its pure intelligence
it is unsullied by memory
it has no trace of any kind of memory
its just pure intelligence
if you touch this
then you have access to what you are referring as the source of creation
because all kinds of things might have been fed to you
god is this
god is love
god is compassion
god is kind
what whatever 
somebody come stand on the edge of this stage
say all the prayer you want to say and fall
let me see whether compassion happens to you
or a cracked bone happens to you
i would like to check all right
all these things have been made up because whatever somebody is deprived of
they will attribute that quality to their idea of god
your ideas of god have come
only because you do not know what
how this whole creation happened
because you dont have an answer
you made it up
because you are human being
you said a big human being is sitting up there
oh how can he do all this
if somebody asked he has ten hands
so he does lot of things not like you
whatever
its all right for children
but essentially because you do not how creation happened
you are coming up with explanations
so that which is the source of creation
dont believe what i say what anybody says
pay attention to one piece of creation
just take a flower pay attention to this
pay an attention to a leaf or an atom or an ant
all you will see is phenomenal intelligence beyond anything you can imagine
yes
but nobody told you
god is intelligence
but this culture has said this to you in many ways
they told you chidhakasha chidambara and so many things to tell you
if you touch your chit the whole existence becomes yours
everything thats worth knowing is right here 
because you have access to the source of creation
so these are the four types of your
four dimensions of your mind
unfortunately the modern education thinks by just feeding information
and keeping the intellect reasonably sharp
everything is going to happen
no
you will rip this planet apart looking for wellbeing
you may lose the planet
or you may manage to go to another planet and start your work again there 
but wellbeing will not happen
if wellbeing has to happen
you have to dig a little deeper into this one 
otherwise no
 so sadhguru
what are some of the things that you know
all of us who are here listening to you
what are the one or two things that we can do tomorrow
which will
which will increase this level of awareness
perception
thoughtfulness
 oh youre talking about a takeaway hmm
 in a sense but you know
an enduring takeaway
its not light hearted its not you know
because weve you know
weve heard a lot and im sitting here and saying okay
so what do i do differently tomorrow
 lets say to learn abc
the twentysix alphabets
at least if you had learned the indian indian languages you know fiftyfour whatever
twentysix alphabets
how long did you take to learn to write them properly in their proper order
and use them whichever way you want
how long did you take
 oh im still at it a long time
 at least three four years minimum
 yeah yeah
 to learn to make sentences and use the way you want
maybe you took twelvefifteen years of education
 much longer than that yes
 yes
so you gave so much just to learn some word craft
but to know something about the fundamental nature of your existence
which could just change you dimensionally
you want to know it in two minutes
why are you so unfair
 no i only want to know where to start in two minutes
 okay where to start
just do this much
before you go to bed today one thing is
every hour okay remind yourself
right now its going to be eight o clock
eight o clock remind yourself  wow im still alive 
no dont laugh
so many people who go to bed today will not wake up tomorrow morning
more than a million people on the planet will not wake up tomorrow morning
tomorrow morning suppose you wake up 
yes who knows
you always think its not me its going to be somebody 
very cruel 
tomorrow morning if you do wake up
first check  am i really awake alive
im still alive wow
you dont have to do anything
dont scream or something 
at least one big smile
okay im still alive
over a million people didnt wake up tonight
but here i am alive
fantastic or no
 yes
 what is the biggest thing in your life
you are alive right now
so youre still on tomorrow morning  just one smile
wow 
then maybe there are two three four people who matter to you much in your life
just check  
he and she and that one and this one is alive
all alive great if one million people died tonight
which they do every night
at least ten million people lost somebody who is dear to them
but none of those who are very dear to you are gone today
fantastic or no
 yes
 tch another big smile
dont tell anybody 
just smile okay great
eight o clock in the morning  wow eight o clock still alive
every one hour just do this exercise okay
every one hour just remind yourself
check 
on
please understand this
if you think about god you will become hallucinatory
only when you are conscious about your mortality
will you want to truly know the nature of this life 
when you know youre on right now
and tomorrow morning you may be poof gone
now you want to know
what the hell
what is this 
im real right now but tomorrow morning gone
so many people who are so real and on suddenly gone
cant believe where did they go
but you thought about it for ten minutes
and then you got busy
you had to text my father is dead 
but remind yourself of your own mortality
let the question deepen
if you can do it every moment its great
if you cannot at least once a hour
remind yourself that you are mortal
you are not immortal you are mortal
if you know that you are mortal
suddenly you will see in a few days
you have no time to do any nonsense which doesnt mean anything to you
you will do only what really matters to your life
you have no time to do any rubbish with anybody
you will have time only to make the
do the best things that you want to do
what you truly care to do in your life
and nothing other than that
and thats what you should be doing
because its a very limited amount of time 
i want you to know its a very brief life
that is if youre a joyful person
if you are a miserable person of course its a long life 
so 
if youre joyful if you live for hundred years its gone too quickly
if youre miserable what a long life you will live you know
so its a very brief life
you should not be doing anything other than what truly matters to you isnt it
yes or no
 yes
 but you are doing so much nonsense
which doesnt mean anything to you
simply because you think you are immortal
otherwise people are saying
no i will live up to eighty maybe hundred
so i will do this at seventy
i will i will smile at my neighbor when i am seventyfive you know
when all my work is done 
when all the property issues are settled 
after that ill smile at him
there is no such guarantee
has anybody here come with a guarantee card for two days 
no you could be dead tomorrow morning
im not wishing that i bless you with a long life
but its possible right
every day its happening to a million people means
cant it be you and me tomorrow morning im asking
yes or no
 yes
 if you are conscious of your mortality
becoming aware will naturally happen
because the significance of being alive will blossom
you used all kinds of words
which are straight from the american coast
mindfulness awareness mental alertness
no you need to separate these things
being mentally alert will help you to survive better
if im mentally alert i can drive better
i can do my work better
i can do something else better
its survival
 right
 awareness is not about survival
when i first asked you the question how do you know that youre here
you went around and then you said im conscious
only because you are aware youre alive
your awareness is aliveness
your aliveness is awareness
the question is only about how alive
lot of people think if they are fifty percent alive its pretty good
yes
you can survive fifty percent
but you need to understand if we want to torture somebody
if you want to torture somebody what would you do
youll kill them
suppose you got got employment in hell lets say
youre given the job of torturing people what will you do
kill them
hello
 no
 no keep them half alive 
if you keep them half alive thats called torture
so right now this is called selftorture
maybe youre preparing for employment elsewhere 
because right from the age of two or three people
your parents are asking you what will you become
what will you become
well im born as a human being
im supposed to strive to become a human being
see every life on this planet
whether it is a bird its a worm insect bird animal tree
whatever
every one of them is striving
to become a fullfledged life and thats all
a worm is trying to be a fullfledged worm
a tree is trying to be a fullfledged tree 
thats all a human being also
to become a fullfledged human being
no no what will you become means
what kind of job will you get  from the age of three 
this madness has come because of this whatever
the last century of poverty in the country
people are so deprived and they think if they dont have a job
they wont eat anything tch you know
it comes from a certain poverty consciousness
we must pass it that generation is passed
right now
if you have a few brain cells working
you can make a living
yes
you dont have to be qualified for anything
if you have a few brain cells working in your head you can make a living
thats not a issue anymore
there was a time it was like that
it's no more like that its time we leave that
its not about what you will become
how you will be
what will be the experience of your life
will it become the peak experience
or is it just a mediocre nonsense 
this is the question
because once you have come as a human being whatever happens its not enough
something more needs to happen
yes or no
 yes
 you may think youre doing different things
the man who goes to the temple
the man who goes to the bar
the man who goes to work
the man who goes to conquer the world
every one of them is just seeking a larger slice of life
some people go to the mall
some people go the pds
just like that
some people think it it comes free in the temple
so they go there
somebody else go to conquer the world
somebody goes shopping
what is it that youre trying to do
just trying to have a larger slice of life
but it doesnt matter if you gather the whole world around you
you will not have a larger slice
your larger slice will happen only if your ability to perceive is enhanced
if your ability to experience is not enlarged
then you can have everything around you
still your experience is the same
modern life is just that
no other generation had the things that we are having around us
most homes are looking like a warehouse 
because their shopping trips
they dont know where to keep it
everything is falling all over the people
theres no place for the people
full of things
but does it bring wellbeing or happiness or anything
no
you cannot determine the experience of whats happening within you from outside
it has to happen from within
and it is how enlarged your experience is
is how big your life is
not about socially how big people think you are
that may work socially a few things for you
but it doesnt work in terms of life
so when we say awareness
we are talking about the essential ingredient of life
because only because you are aware youre alive isnt it so
yes
 yes
 now the question is how alive
if you have to use an analogy  right now this light is you know blinding me 
now if you reduce the voltage itll be like this 
itll light up only that much 
but they want it to light up everything
so they turned up the voltage
so if you turn down the voltage
you will see only this much 
if you turn it up you will see that much 
if you really turn it up you will see the entire hall
awareness is the same thing
because you are conscious or you are aware
you know something
if you become little more aware
you will know something more
if you know  little more aware something more
all these words are connected  pragna the word guru
all these things are connected because
pragna means youre conscious
because you are conscious
depending upon the intensity of your consciousness
accordingly your vision of everything around you is enhanced
now the word guru means
gu means darkness  tch its a four letter word you know 
ru means dispeller
so a guru is not supposed to teach you something
he is not supposed to give you a philosophy
not supposed to give you an ideology
it is just that he is supposed to throw little more light
little more light means
suppose this hall is dark and youre only able to see the first two rows
you are not able to see them 
if i flashed a torch light
you saw oh all those people
its a whole world out there
but i switched off the torch then you know
there is something now i have to see what do i need
i need a torch beam of my own okay 
this is the job 
because they the children in the home where i am staying
theyre declaring he is he is not like a guru
he doesnt talk like a guru
he doesnt look like a guru
he doesnt walk like a guru
hes not a guru 
im very glad im getting certified 
 yes yes
  now about seeing everything the way it is
because if i want to walk through this
therere whole lot of people right now belief systems
you believe in god all right
now i know in the corporate world
people have shifted this
i believe in myself 
 which is somewhat misplaced but thats okay 
 both are misplaced
they produce different kinds of impacts
 absolutely
 see belief means what
essentially belief means youre unwilling to admit
what you do not know as i do not know
whatever you do not know you believe
if you believe what it does to you is
itll give you confidence
confidence without clarity is a disaster
right now let us say
i cannot see these people 
my vision is not clear but i have great confidence
im going to walk through these people
you know what i will do
ill step over everybody and go because im very confident
therere whole lot of people like this
if my vision is clear
i will go through this without even touching anybody
if my vision is not clear and i have no confidence
i will ask please can somebody show me the way
but now i have no clarity but i have confidence
its a disastrous process
so believing in god
believing in yourself
believing in anything means  its just a b word you know
youre just bullshitting yourself about something that you do not know 
 right right
  wha what is the problem
what i know i know what i do not know i do not know 
what is the problem with this
if this much sincerity enters your life
come to this much 
what i know i know what i do not know i do not know
i dont believe anything
i dont disbelieve anything
i am willing to look at everything
youll become a sensible human being
and every one hour you remind yourself you are mortal
and once  you know celebrate with a smile that youre still alive
you will see wonders will happen to you 
 thank you great 
so even a freeflowing
 hey wait wait its eight o clock
 no no no no we have more time 
we have more time
i was just going to say
 no i im not saying that its eight o clock
youre still alive wow 
 we are all alive 
thats the collective celebration 
okay
so even a freeflowing conversation is limited by time
weve got about twenty minutes left
and what id like to do is throw the floor open to questions from any of you
 my question is directly direct and very simple
i learnt a simple process which says that you know
whenever doubt arises in our life you know
doubt the doubt
and whenever trust arises trust the trust
so that helped me a lot in terms of my
 so your question would be
 my question is now that the ultimate
next step we are saying
the ultimate as the final step
i would like to ask is dissolution or what we call moksha hmm
that is one area which you know i dont know how to take a you know
step forward
i dont know whether i my question is clear
 you want to dissolve 
okay
 that is the ultimate process
 you need a barrel of sulphuric acid 
please sit down
 okay can we have s
 no we will answer that question
 should we take one or two other questions
if you are okay with that
 but you wont get this kind of a question 
 okay we wont get this
all right  all right
  see the reason why the socalled spiritual process
has fallen upon ridicule in the world is
well there may be few entrepreneurs who do their own things
leave them
im not going into that
but the reason why spiritual process has become ridiculous on the planet is
because people try to do the highest things on the street side
without the necessary committed atmosphere
without the necessary focus
simply talk about mukti moksha you know
in the previous generation everybody talked about mukti moksha
just about anywhere sitting standing
whenever life became mi miserable they want moksha
when its going well they forget about moksha 
their idea of moksha itself is convoluted
so this is important
with all due respect to everybody who has spoken about these things
maybe those things were spoken in a certain atmosphere
to a certain individual
towards a certain purpose
i think its quite irresponsible first of all to print that in a book
and just everybody reads it
without knowing the context of what it is
without having gon gone through the journey
that person who asked that question has gone through
the question doesnt have depth
answers we can give any number
all you will do is youll pick up more words from today evening
and its not going to do anything
if you are serious about it
if youre really serious about it
if youre serious about your journey leave all this
first of all get rid of all the jargon
all the spiritual jargon
just come to this much 
how much of you is sense how much of you is nonsense
sit down unprejudiced just make an evaluation
just an accountants job okay
how much of you is  let me use the right appropriate word 
sense and how much of you is nonsense
every day sieve it out
you will see its not an easy job
and ask some of you two friends of yours and two people who dont like you 
also to assess you you know
you need a outside opinion isnt it
second opinion  is always good
you will see its a great cleansing process
instead of talking mukti moksha dissolution sushupthi
something else
something else 
these are all words
anybody can pick up sanskrit words what is the point
lets take
all the scriptures
all the teachings
all the philosophies
all the great things that people have spoken about
all of them are worth nothing
compared to a single existential te step that you took inward
if you take one step
it is worth more than all the scriptures in the universe put together 
 sadhguru namaste
you spoke about the energy manas chitta ahankara and all that
the existence of all these is the basic
that is the body and the body is the composition of the pancha bhutas
each one has got his own energies
would you kindly throw light on those five energies
which is making us here
speaking listening to you and all that please
 so pancha bhutas or these are called as the maha bhutas
because these are the five elements
which are the fundamental ingredients with which everything is made
your body is five elements
the world is five elements
the whole universe is five elements
so when adiyogi was transmitting this knowing to the seven sages
who are today known as the saptarishis
they wanted to know
what is the nature of this creation
where does it begin where does it end
he was bored with them you know
students can bore you
teachers can bore you but students can bore you
they dont understand that
he was just bored with them
he said
all your great cosmos that you are talking about
how big it is where it begins where it ends
i can roll it all up and pack it into a mustard seed
thats efficient packing
corporate i think 
 nano
 then they wouldnt leave there but they said
what is the nature of this universe
by now he was too bored
he didnt want to waste his words
he simply said like this 
just five
you just have to know five thats all
not five million just five
just see with five ingredients how much mischief
look at the variety thats happened in the universe
the size and the variety and the immensity of whats happened
just with five
incredible or not
out of this five
these four come from one
 sir can you tell me in what in kannada im not able to get the names
anyway earth water fire air and space
so these five elements are in a certain composition in different aspects of life
lets take life
not inanimate things  even there it is there
but  in different lives
it is in different compositions
in you seventytwo percent is water
twelve percent is earth
six percent is air
four percent is fire
remaining is space
when i say remaining
vinita is calculating
okay six percent akash
no i said remaining is space
because we are not talking about physical entities alone
not talking about the physical dimension alone
so hundred percent is not the quantity
as long as you measure the body yes
once you come to akash youre not talking about percentages
so what you are referring to as akash
because the word akash is being loosely used today in common language
the word akash did not mean sky
it meant the fifth element
because your eyes cannot see beyond the fifth element
only in the night you are able to see beyond that
during the day what you see is just the etheric sphere
and because of the way light plays on ether
it all turns blue in your vision
otherwise youre just seeing
like suppose a cloudcover came youre seeing only the cloud
that is the sky for you on that day
you say a clear sky
no it is a  etheric sky that youre seeing
its an etheric bubble
beyond the atmospheric bubble theres an etheric bubble
light dissipates in a certain way refracts in a certain way there
because of that your vision closes there
only in the night when there is no sunlight
then you are seeing beyond the etheric space
now akash is another dimension of perception and intelligence and existence
so your akash
your water is here 
your fire is here 
your air is here 
your earth is here 
but your akash is not just here  its spread
normally for a person who is
lets say physically healthy and reasonably agile and active
for him his akash is somewhere between nine to eighteen inches around his body
but if you do a little effort
this bubble can be expanded limitlessly
so today youre looking for the icloud
theres already a cloud and this cloud can be enlarged
you can make it as large as this planet
you can make it as large as this universe
it is a just a question of your willingness thats all
your boundaries or how small your boundaries are
are question of your unwillingness to transact isnt it
tch lets say your social boundary
how big your social boundary is
or how small it is
is a question of willingness and unwillingness
in terms of your social activity
similarly existentially
how willing this life  has become
or how unwilling this life  has become
why would i be unwilling  this is the question
you need to understand this
because things are packaged one inside the other
life is made in such a way
what you call as life is also death at the same time
right now you can say im living
or you can say im dying
actually you are dying one day itll be complete
yes or no
 yes
 whether you call it living or dying its the same thing
but we are looking at it as two different things
the moment you look at it as two different things 
thats why the mortality process 
the moment you look at it as two different things
you will accept one part of it
you will resist another part of it
once you resist
if you resist death you will not resist something the called as death
you will only avoid living
right now tomorrow morning you start the chant
i dont want to die i dont want to die i dont want to die i dont want to die
all thatll happen is you wont live
whether youll die or not we dont know but you will not live for sure 
so because life is is inclusive
but intellect is exclusive
always it wants to cut and see
what is life what is death  there is no such thing
they are intermingled both are happening at the same time
because of this akash
if you are able to perceive your akash consciously
suddenly your ability to know is just effortless
you can have the luxury of remaining uneducated and still be okay
you can still be okay even if you are uneducated
because everything thats worth knowing about life is here 
in these five elements
so the most fundamental aspect of the yogic process is called bhuta shuddhi
every yogic practice
whatever you do
is a little extension
or little extract from bhuta shuddhi
which means cleansing of the elements
if you do enough of this
then you arrive at what is called as bhuta siddhi
that means you have some mastery over your elements
if you have mastery over your elements
your body will happen the way you want it
your life will happen the way you want it
your destiny is determined by you
not only that
even things around you will happen the way you want it
lives around you will happen the way you want it
plants will flower out of season
things will happen in ways that you thought not possible
is this something supernatural
is this superhuman
no
this is not about being superhuman
this is about realizing being human is super 
and the nature of the five elements
what they are
how they function
an enormous amount of study and science and experiential dimensions to it
has been done in this land
unfortunately we are ignoring all that
and trying to handle everything on the chemical level for health and wellbeing
which is a very
unfortunately very very rudimentary way of handling life
when we see all this
this whole way of treating human beings with chemicals and stuff
has become relevant only because we are overpopulated and too crowded and all this
if you were little more spread out
if you lived in your own land
if you lived in the jungle
you most probably did not get any infectious diseases okay
only for infectious diseases chemical warfare is okay
but for chronic ailments
its something that happening because you lost fundamental balance
one most fundamental thing is if one of the elements is not in tune
this will do horrible things to you
so one simple way is
in this culture they taught you
if you have to eat your food first you bow down to it
you are not saying thank you to any god okay
please dont do this
if at all if you want to thank the somebody
thank that poor farmer who doesnt eat what he grows and gives it to you 
we are not thanking any gods
we are not looking up and saying thanks for the daily bread whatever
were just bowing down to the food because
we know how you treat the food accordingly it behaves within you
today there is enormous amount of study
which shows
for example water
this water  has enormous memory
if i just as much as look at it in a certain way
its molecular composition changes
not the chemical composition but the molecular composition changes and it behaves differently
lot of experimentation has happened about this and today
theyve come up with something called imploding water
where some of you might have experienced this
suppose you went to a waterfall
and the water that is falling with great force
if you touch the water it feels silky
have you ever noticed this
yes
if it goes down two miles and then touch it it wont feel like that
only there it feels silky because the water is imploding into itself
now theyve created imploding machines
you can implode the water and you feed this water to your plants
with ten percent of irrigation you can get the same results
simply because the water is imploded
these imploding machines which were made in uk
we are kind of getting them for the local farmers
so that the water is imploded
with minimal water you can grow the same crops
because just changing the molecular composition changes so much
weve always known this
this is why why do you think people go to a temple 
and they are dying for that two drops of water
because the water is supposed to have the memory of the divine
supposed to be in touch with the deity
and there is supposed to be memory
and you take it and its supposed to work
if it this whole science is managed properly
but today we dont know how it is in most of the places
but the possibility of changing the
how the water behaves within you
just by treating it differently
before drinking just bow down to the water
dont see it as a commodity its not a commodity
it is lifemaking ingredient
this  is more important
than your mother father your children anybody isnt it so
 yes
 what is in this vessel right now
please tell me i want you to hear that
 yes
 yes
 yes because if you dont drink it for one day you will not want anybody 
you want only this 
no we are talking about the real thing 
so the five elements
if you learn to handle them properly
simple thing
whatever  the earth that you walk upon
the air that you breathe
water that you drink
food that you eat and the sky 
three times a day consciously just 
put your hands together for these things
these are the lifemaking ingredients
your life is made out of this
just approach it differently
you will see your health situation
your sense of wellbeing
your stability
everything will be greatly enhanced
if you want to do proper practice of bhus bhuta shuddhi
please come we have elaborate systems of bhuta shuddhi
probably nowhere else in the world right now these kinds of systems are offered
but they will need a certain amount of preparation and absolute dedication to pursue that 
 i have been seeing your videos in youtube
this is the first time that i am seeing you live
so i have a basic questions
which will help everyone here
everyone talks about you know
knowing ourselves and the first step is going inside
and then the way to go inside is meditation and when i try to
 i dont know please dont  do i never said such things
i dont know which everyone said those things 
 okay so then how do we go inside
 that is the question 
 inside what
you are already inside the hall 
inside what
 inside ourselves
 ohh 
 okay if that is the truth of the first step of knowing answers for all the questions
if going inside is the answer
then how do we do that
 first of all you must understand what is inside
okay
and what is outside
if you do not understand what is inside and outside
then you will go to all the wrong places
now what is inside
your body  accumulated over a period of time
yes or no
hello
maa
 yes
 what you accumulate can be yours cannot be you
is that much clear
 yes
 whatever it may be
what you accumulate can be yours cannot be you
so this body  is an accumulation
what you call as my mind the whole content of the mind is accumulated
depending upon what you are exposed to in your life
so your body is a heap of food
small or big
your mind is a heap of impressions again small or big
between these two heaps where the hell are you
so inside outside
leave these words because when it comes to language
there is only that much leeway
so within that
maybe different people are trying to use it in different ways
we dont know in what context they used
you put everybody into one bundle and said all of you said this
i dont know who these all people are
different people employed different methods around them
looking at the people around them
what was best suitable for the people around them
accordingly they would have worked most probably
if they are genuine they would have worked with the people around them
not with concepts from somewhere
what
looking at an individual person you will do something
what works for that person
what you do with this person  may not work for another person
youll have to do something else with that person
but you are talking about a generic inward outward
so first determine what is inward outward
everything is outward right now
the world is outside
body is also external material
all the material in the mind also is external
so what is this inward you are talking about
then you will immediately say
atma paramatma soul this one
now you are going into belief system
you dont know
you know you have a body
yes
hello
 yes
 please check your neighbors 
you know you have a body
you believe you have a mind 
but to some extent you know
but rest is belief
yes or no
 yes
 im not questioning whether its true or false
lets not go there at all but its belief
its not yet in your experience
if you talk about something which is not yet in your experience
to put it bluntly
youre just a bloody liar
thats what it means
but because lies are holy
lies are written in scriptures
lies are repeated by all kinds of people who dressed in different ways
which are supposed be holy though ridiculous
because of this
you are not supposed to question these words
anywhere you go first thing is people say
sadhguru what about the soul
i ask them which sole right or left
so lets not te talk about something that is not in your experience
right now your body is in your experience to some extent
your mind is in your experience to some extent
rest you dont know but we can infer
if i have to accumulate this much  body
if i have to accumulate this much  mind
something more fundamental must be there
yes
something more fundamental must be there
we dont know what the hell it is
for now we will call it you
how you will go into yourself im asking 
you can go into this hall
you can go out of this hall
how will you go into yourself im asking tch
saying lets leave this this is not the way
you do this way
what is not you all those things you keep it aside
before today
if you
before you go to bed everything thats not you keep it aside
they may be precious to you you think about it
your house is it you oh my house  
all right you have lots of passion about it but all right keep it aside
your husband is it you no thats easy he is not me 
my children are is the are they me
oh little difficulty but no  tch they are not me
theyre beginning to tell you  if theyre twelve
theyve already told you 
so the clothes that you wear is that you
no
the body that you wear is that you
no
all these thoughts and emotion is this you
no
everything thats not you keep it in one heap
not physically just do this mentally
keep everything aside let me see
every day you practice this
one day when you successfully keep everything aside that you are not
what you are will be there 
we have too many ideas about things that weve not seen
this is a big problem
shankaran pillai went to britannia 
can i
 you love the story yes
 shankaran pillai went to britannia industries  to find a job to find a job
so they were looking for a really smart
farseeing sales manager
so they asked him one question
which is further  mumbai or moon
shankaran pillai thought he said mumbai
they said what
mumbai is further than the moon
he said yes
how
well i can see the moon i cant see mumbai 
so what i am saying is
if you go by your present perception
youll get all the wrong conclusions
so dont be in a rush to make conclusions
lets pay little more attention
you are a worthwhile life
which deserves some attention isnt it
dont seek other peoples attention 
your own attention
doesnt this life  deserve attention
pay attention to this 
enough attention everything will be clear
everything about you youre asking me
if i tell you what do you have you have some more words
tch some more words you have
that will not get you anywhere near the truth
one more word or ten more words doesnt get you any closer to reality
just youll have more things to say to somebody else
this kind of hearsay is spreading in the world
everybody knows where god is
who his wife is
how many children he has
when is his birthday
his address
in every bhajan people are singing his address
where he is and how to get him
but they dont know a damn thing about themselves
this kind of what to say
a very knowledgeable ignorance is dangerous  you know
if you do not know its not a problem
if i see i do not know
the possibility of knowing is always there isnt it
if i do not know and i think i know
then ive destroyed all possibilities
so we have arrived at many things
we know
in every culture they know what is the nature of god
where he resides
how the ambience is there and the works you know
tch you
everybody knows the geography of the heaven isnt it
dont you
but you dont know a damn thing about yourself
its time
its time we paid attention because
everything you know you know it only the way its projected in the firmament of your mind
you dont know anything any other way
yes or no
 yes
 so what you need to fix is
you are seeing everything in a mirror of your mind
and the mirror is wonky
first fix it
first thing is to make it stable
flat
proper plain mirror
so that you see everything the way it is
does the plain mirror show you everything the way it is
everything reverse you know
then youll have to flip it thatll take much more skill
most people cant flip a dosa 
now to flip the whole universe
the whole life that is reflecting in your mind
to flip it over without shattering it into pieces will take much more
but the first thing is to level out the mirror so that
it shows you everything the way it is not some other way
right now everything is seen depending upon how you are identified with something
every identity has distorted the mirror of your mind
and it shows you things in completely different way than the way it is
first thing is stop talking about things that you do not know
no soul no atman no paramatman no god no divine no heaven
talk about something that you know
and then the longing to take the next step will become strong
otherwise when you know the geography of the heaven
what is the need to pay attention to anything
very dangerous 
thank you very much 
 thank you very much thank you thank you sadhguru
