sadhguru chants sanskrit chant jananam sukhadam
 good evening
good evening everyone
 you know
you really need to explain certain things to me today
some of the things that have been happening here that dont make sense to me
thank you very much by the way for joining us in this conversation
lets start with the lighting of  
lit by sudhir and the rest of them
what does that mean
 an oil lamp
if you create a certain amount of fire
it creates
after all the entire existence
the whole universe including yourself and myself and everybody else
is just a play of five elements
of earth
water
air
fire
and space
so fire 
just you get fired up 
 ah  okay
and then the chant
the twominute chant
and that was preceded by some motions of your hands
and this is me being curious
im sure therell be a lot of other people curious about whats going on
so that we get a better understanding
any curious people at all yeah
almost everybodys curious about whats going on
so then the chant
what was the chant
what were you saying there
 the chant is about this
birth is sweet  you know
were born and life is on and suddenly a child is bubbling with life
its a very sweet happening
but death is compassion
people think death is some kind of a terrible thing
i want you to imagine
suppose you cant die
what would you do
 youre saying death is not a bad thing
 hmm
 its not a bad thing death
 no im asking you
suppose you could not die
what would you do
the best thing about life is
the best thing about life is
you will never fail because everybody shall pass 
 i needed to get these things out of the way 
before we begin our conversation because
 and and the next part of the chant is
we may understand life in so many different ways
essentially it's a certain play of time and energy
time is slipping away
as we sit here its slipping away
we may think many things in our minds
socially we may think were doing many things
but as far as this body is concerned
it is making its journey straight to the grave
without wavering for a moment
as we sit here
it is moving in that direction
so the only way you can maximize life
is by tweaking up your energy levels in a certain way
if you live for the same amount of time
till
still you lived more because
this combination of time and energy
time is anyway flowing
but you can play with energy in such a way
that you can raise the nature of your life
the experience of your life
the profoundness of your life
and above all
move from many entanglements
which seem to define and describe life for most people
towards a a limitless sense of freedom
or boundlessness within you
this is not because you are not bound by time
youre still bound by time
but because youve tweaked your energy in a certain way
suddenly you look like youre above that
 interesting sadhguru
its an honor to talk to you
and thank you very much for making time to come to uganda
and you know
the most obvious questions that will be in many peoples minds
and some of them might be here actually  is
whos this guy
you know who is he
he has a long beard
i described him
i described you to some people
 youre trying too
 no so whos this guy
and so when they come in here
and theres this whole setup
and theres this glowing tribute with someone saying that
youre as powerful as an as the uni you know
power extends across the universe
i thought to myself
is this guy god
who is this guy
and it would be interesting if you helped us understand who you are
and where you come from
and how you ended up in uganda 
 youre asking for a long story 
 we have time 
 i im just seeing how to abridge the story

see
i grew up being a super skeptic
super super skeptic
i have a million questions about everything
i did not identify myself
with my family
nor the local religion
nor the social structures
nor the political structures
nor even the nationality of where i was born
because i did not identify myself with anything
though i was involved with everything
i did not belong to anything
which gave me a certain freedom of looking at everything the way it is
because the moment you get identified with something
you become prejudiced in a certain way
you look at everything from that context
so i had no context
i was just a bursting life
and as i was telling you
restless 
restless not because of anything
i was very joyful and peaceful
that was not an issue
restless because i knew there is something more
but i did not know what that something more is
so it kind of drove me to all kinds of places
i crisscrossed india on my motorcycle
but then you know
i was probably nineteen
almost twenty at that time
i went to the nepalese border
till then
i did not know there is something called a passport
today a fiveyearold kid would know 
 really
 i did not know
ive been riding since im eleven without license
when i became eighteen i got my license
and i thought thats my passport to the world 
suddenly they stopped me and asked
wheres your passport
i said what is that
they said theres something else you need to cross the border
so i came all the way back to south india
then i decided ill equip myself with the needed money
and whatever the documents needed
and im going to ride around the world
so for this i started a business
i thought ill make some money then
 what business
 initially i started a farm
then i got into construction
then i got into brickmaking
and in about five years time
i became very successful
i had my hands in about halfadozen businesses
for those days i was very successful
by those standards
so everybody is clapping their hands and saying
youre doing great
so im in this kind of state where im cocky and
you know
when everything is working your way
the planets dont go around the sun
they go around you 
so all the planets were spinning around me
and im
everybody is saying youre great
so im going on like this
one afternoon
between two business meetings
i had
please if you can keep your cameras down please
its
itll be posted on the youtube
you can download it
okay 
dont waste your time be with me 
one afternoon
between two business meetings
i had nothing much to do
so i come from a town called mysore
are people familiar with mysore
mysore city
 yes
 almost everybody
this is kampala though
 so 
theres a small hill in mysore called chamundi hill
the culture and the tradition of the time
especially for the youth was 
if we want to test our motorcycles
we went up chamundi hill
if we want to party we went up chamundi hill
17
 to party
 yeah
 you used to party 
 i right now im always in a party 
cant you see 
so if you fall in love
you got to go up chamundi hill
if you fall out you must go up chamundi hill 
 how many times
how many times did you make that trip
 ah  
and if you have nothing to do
you have to go up chamundi hill 
so on this afternoon i had nothing much to do
so i rode up chamundi hill
i know this hill very well
ive trekked in these hills
ive camped in these hills ive
as a seven eightyearold child
why am i telling you all this
if i found ten rupees in those days
i would just leave a note
and i would vanish into the jungle
 its called theft right
 hmm no
 no helping yourself to it
 no no it was given to me
if i had ten rupees im gone
 oh
 and from the age of seven
i earned my own pocket money right through 
never borrowed
never took any money from my parents
so dont worry about theft 
the thing is i went off into the hills
if i had enough food for four days
im gone for four days
theyre searching all over
police complaints
looking all over the town
one thing they dont know is im in the jungle
 doing what
 oh i walked around familiarized
myself with every other life
i caught a bunch of snakes
i caught all kinds of insects
i
i was learning life paying attention to all kinds of life
theres more life in the jungle than in kampala you know

more variety i mean 
and more numbers too
so i know this place very well
so that afternoon
i went and sat up on a rock that i was
very familiar to me
my eyes were still open
ive been practicing yoga since twelve years of age
but that was mainly for physical prowess and mental prowess
which it definitely did give me it did set me apart
among any group of people
but i never knew there is something else to it
that afternoon i sat there
my eyes were still open
till that moment
i thought this is me and that is somebody
i have no issues with that somebody
but this is me and that is someone else
suddenly i did not know
which is me and which is not me
the very air i breathe
the rock i was sitting upon
the atmosphere around me
everything became me
i thought this madness lasted for about maybe tenfifteen minutes
but when i came back to my normal senses
about fourandahalf hours had passed
for the first time in my adult life
tears 
me and tears were impossible 
tears are flowing to a point my shirt is all wet
ive always been peaceful and happy
life is working out the way i want
im young and successful
and no problems
it is just that every cell in my body was bursting with ecstasy
tears are just dripping like this
so when i shook my skeptical head and asked
whats happening to me
the only thing that my mind could tell me was
maybe im going off my rocker
 which happens 
 so when i spoke to the closest of my friends
and tried to tell them something is happening to me
the questions that came to me is only this 
what did you drink
what did you pop you know 
what
why im saying this is
i had no context of any kind
something was happening within me for which i had no any kind of knowledge
there was nobody around me to tell me what this is about
all i knew is
ive hit a goldmine and i dont want to lose it
because if i simply sit like this
two minutes
i feel its two minutes
seveneight hours have just passed away like that
once i sat like this and i thought its twentyfive thirty minutes
but when i opened my eyes
it's thirteen days gone by
 you sat in one place for thirteen days
 yes
i i sat there only for twentyfive thirty minutes in my experience
by the time i opened my eyes
there was a huge crowd
india being what it is
they were pulling my legs and asking 
whatll happen to their business
when will their daughters get married
and all this stuff 
 and and and and
you still get a lot of that 
when is my daughter getting married
and whats happening to my to my business
 i dont tell them anymore
when their daughters will get married 
its the daughters business when she gets married 
 and then
thats an interesting story
it begins there
ends up in uganda now
were sitting down in front
 hey im not ending up here 
 youre not
so were in uganda at the moment
 yeah
 how did why uganda
how did you end up here
okay you say youre not ending up here
i understand that  but why uganda
 africa has been on my mind for some time
but my schedules have been so killing
that you know
its not been possible to stop over in africa
so when we thought
which country or
when people started inviting us here
i always go everywhere by invitation
so the invitations here were strong
the ambassador of india
and the mehta family and many others
who have done programs
all the business magnates here
they all did their inner engineering some time ago
because some of our teachers came here and taught programs
since then there has been a strong pitch
so
we took this week off and were in africa
not just uganda
im also touching kenya and south africa
 lets give the sadhguru a round of applause
ladies and gentlemen 
for and now
 whats that for
 yeah because youre here
youre welcome
now lets talk about uganda and 
when i was trying to prepare myself for this conversation
i was wondering why should i be talking to you about uganda
because you know your realities are different
arent they
this is uganda
it has its fair share of challenges
you dont know uganda very well
and yet im here trying to talk to you about uganda
 i may not know uganda very well
i may not know uganda very well
i know human beings perfectly well
wherever the hell they are  
wherever they are fundamentally they are same
its just different cultural expressions
different languages
different styles of doing things
but fundamentally wherever you go
human problems and human aspirations are same
 what are the most common ones do you think
 com
 the most common problems
or challenges that human beings face
 the most fundamental problem with human beings is
what they need to fix within themselves
theyre trying to fix the entire world for that 
this is happening everywhere
people are talking about world peace
but they cant sit in one place for one minute peacefully

but theyre talking  about making the world peaceful
its never going to work
if you dont know how to keep your mind feace peaceful
how are you going to make the world peaceful
what you see in the world is
just a larger manifestation of whats happening in individual minds
so if we just want to do a political slogan
we can shout
world peace
and go away
but if were truly interested
then we have to have a lifelong commitment
of bringing peace to individual people
without individual salvation
there is no universal salvation
 and you make an important point
because uganda is trying to transform itself
were trying to come from where we are now
which is a country this
thats struggling in many respects
its done well in many ways
but it also still has a long way to go
so it begins with the individual isnt it
 so when you say long way to go
where do you want to go
do you want to become another state in united states 
is that what youre aspiring for
 i wish president museveni was here
president museveni would have answered that question 
 no mr t is coming okay
 okay 
 so what im saying is
its very important when i look at a country like this
which is naturally so beautiful
nature has been immensely kind to you
you dont know what it means to live in harsh conditions of nature
this is a beautiful beautiful country
i know if you go by
right now the world is on a madness of
everything bigger 
bigger home
bigger car
bigger this bigger that instead of all this everything making bigger
i think in uganda  you should think how to have a bigger lake
 a bigger lake
 bigger lake
 thats more important than a bigger house
 because if you have all these other things bigger
your lake will shrink
this has happened
in india were beginning to suffer this seriously
in 1947 when we got independence
how much per capita potable water we had
today we have only eighteen percent of that
theyre saying by 2025
we will have only seven percent
this means indians will be having bath in bottles
not in tubs
so this is where the world is going
when nature has been good to you
keeping it that way is the most important thing
for the wellbeing of the people 
the thing is
for the human beings
if theyre wellnourished
and there is a beautiful atmosphere around them
and their aspirations are tailored
according to the nature of whats happening around them
its better
than to go the way america has gone
because i want you to understand
those aspirations and those standards were set up
when they believed
five percent of the people will rob the ninetyfive percent of the people
to create the comforts and conveniences that they have
today the living earth statistics says
that if we have to provide
what an average american citizen has
to 73 billion people
we need fourandahalf planets
but we have only half of it left
 and as a result of that
you know you say that we need to make things smaller
but i want to be like sudhir 
i want to have a big house
i want to own munyonyo
i want to be able to send my children to the best schools possible
you know whas
how do i do that while maintaining the balance
that youre talking about
 see this is why in the world if
if we really want to
want to be giving a world
to the next generation of people
or we want to hand over a ruin to next generation of people
this is something we have to make up our minds
because this is one of the most important responsibilities
we have as a generation of people
that is
see first of all
we need to understand
we are just baton carriers
were just a small popup on this planet
and we will pop out
okay
so this small popup lives here
as if you are the last generation on the planet
no
one of the most important things in our lives is
how the planet was given to us
how life was given to us
how we are
we must leave the next generation in at least one step better place than where we are
otherwise we have failed as a generation
theres no question about it
 that is easy to say when you have food in your stomach
 yes thats why im saying
 without food in your stomach
i dont care about the future generation
 yes
 i im keen to make sure that my realities are taken care of
 to have food in the stomach
you dont have to destroy the planet
you have to nourish the planet
food comes from the planet
not from the supermarket 
so
to
to feed the population on this planet
the way i see the soil and the atmosphere
and the climate the way it is
im telling you
this east africa can be the bread basket for the entire world
because twelve months of a year you can grow crops here

if you destroy this
you will not be able to grow food even for yourself after some time
this is happening seriously in india
we have a 12000year history of agriculture in south india
this is probably not known to most people 
12000 years of agriculture
certain communities have been farming the same land
for over 810000 years
but today
in one generation
the soil condition is becoming in such a way
theres an alarming situation
that in fifteentwenty years time
we may not be able to grow anything
because the animals have been removed
chemicals have been pumped in
machines are roaring all the time
machines dont replenish the soil
it take animals
it takes plants
it takes trees to replenish the soil
so who we are 
the very body that you carry is just soil isnt it
hello
 yes
 you must get it from me now
otherwise one day youll anyway get it from the maggots
and itll be too late 
its very important to understand
who we are is just this soil
now it is easy to talk when there is food in the stomach
this is what im saying
to put food in the stomach for all the sevenbillion people
is not a challenge
if we keep the planet in a certain way
and above all
at the beginning of twentieth century
we were 16 billion people
why have we become 73 billion people in one century
what wrong with us
irresponsible reproduction isnt it 
now the reason
one main reason is
the life expectancy has increased on an average all across the world
which is a great thing
but when we learn to postpone death
should we also not learn to postpone birth
does it make sense to you
im asking 
 but ultimately though you know
you talk about 7 billion people
you talk about the planet
but what about the individual you know
we come back to that individual and and
and my individual interests
how do i best harness them or condition them
so that they fit into societys interests
because the truth of the matter is
the way the world is organized
certainly the world that i live in
its a cutthroat competition
everybodys competing for the resources
we have everybody is trying to be a mehta
everybody is trying to be a sudhir
and as a result you know
it becomes very difficult
so how do i as an individual then make sure
that my contribution to society is one that benefits everybody
i know youve talked about the planet but how
how do i do that
 see whoever you are right now
whatever you are right now
you would like to be something more
than what youre right now
yes or no
 hello
im talking to all of you
 yes
 if that something more happens what
something more
if that something more happens
what
 something more
 something more
so in installments you want to go somewhere
you want to expand
so because youre going in installments
let me hasten you up a little bit
and i will make you the king or queen of this planet
dont look at me hopefully 
do i look like someone who will commit such a blunder
if i make you the king or the queen of this planet
will you be fulfilled im asking you
 no
 you will look at the stars
so there is something within a human being
which is longing to expand
because right now youre so limited in your identity
with your biology
with your physicality
because of this
youre trying to expand physically
physical expansion means 
if it finds a very basic physical
biological expression
this is called sexuality
if you find an emotional expression
this will be called love
what all these things mean is
something that is not you
youre trying to make it a part of yourself
if its a physical process
its called sexuality
if its an emotional process its called love
if its a mental process
it gets labeled as greed
or ambition
or conquest
or simply shopping  
these are all different ways
to make something which is not a part of you
part of yourself in some way
but if it finds a conscious expression
its called yoga
tch thats why were here sir
 yoga
and in that you say that
the body is the ultimate form of technology
 no thats next
but right now
your identity that
your identity is so much with your physicality
youre trying to expand physically
because youre trying to expand physically
you will see it doesnt matter
if you get the solar system in your hands
you will not be fulfilled
if you get the galaxy youll look for other galaxies
because what a human being is looking for is not more
when you pointed out these people and said
i want to be like this
youre talking about
how can i have more
what youre looking for is not more
you want all
if you want all
physical is not the way isnt it
if you want to expand in a limitless way
physical is not the way
because the nature of your physicality
is defined by a boundary
we can call this a physical body
only because it has a boundary
if you remove all these boundaries
it is no more a physical thing
physicality is always defined by a boundary
but there is something within you
longing to become boundless
this longing to become boundless
is being misunderstood
as longing to have more
more is not what its looking for
this life  is looking for a limitless expansion
if limitless expansion has to happen
one has to transcend their perception
beyond their physical nature
if your perception rises beyond physical nature
then we use this horribly corrupted word
spiritual
 and we shall come to spiritual elements
a bit later
right now though
lets talk about politics
its an interesting subject 
politics of a country the politics of a country like uganda
is politics a good thing
 see when we say politics
what we are talking about 
how to govern a nation
or what were talking about is
how to make the lives of larger mass of people
whore around us
 thats the ideal description
 that is the fundamental
how it is conducted today is another matter
that is because of variety of things
because we chose democracy
once you say this is a democratic nation
what this means is
any one of you tomorrow could become the leader of this nation
thats what it means
 really 
 dont dont be so hopeless  
yes
in
in
 i know someone who used to think that 
 in indian languages
democracy is described as jananayakam
what this means it
people are the leaders
thats what it means
well right now we have a prime minister in this
in our country proving this
that a teaseller can become the prime minister of a nation

so anybody could become
only thing is
you have to learn to work the system
 that you need to do
that you need to do
 and the goddamn system is too convoluted
in so many ways
because we must understand
even if for hundred years were practicing democracy
it is new
in human mind
it is still new
we somewhere
most people i am telling you
most people in the world are still looking up to somebody like a king
because
democracy is a functional reality
only when each individual is having a considered vote
but in most countries
it is a committed vote already
based on religion
caste
creed
tribes
its a committed vote
once its a committed vote
it is feudalism in the guise of democracy
it is not just in you know
asian countries or african countries
for example if you go to america
people say
my grandfather was a republican
my father was a republican
i am a republican
im saying its a committed vote
there is no consideration
otherwise how could 
 how
how do you describe a good leader
do you know
as a matter of fact id like you to do that
with an example
of a leader who you consider as a good one
and describe the traits
the elements that make him a good leader
 see a leader in a democratic society means
because his powers are limited
and his duration
 did you say his powers are limited
 yes theyre limited
it is not like being a king or a dictator
where he can do what he wants
even if hes wellintentioned
his powers are limited
because you have to convince
i dont know how many members of parliaments and stuff you have here
in india for example
you have to convince these fivehundredandfortytwo people
 oh my god 
 uganda its about fourhundredandeighty
 oh  youre getting there 
so by the time you convince these fivehundred people
to think in one direction
five years are over 
so democracy is a limited amount of power
and you have to convince everybody
you should be able to inspire the population
to rise above their personal needs
and work for the national need
which is not simple
its a very complex process
and in a democratic process
for a leader to come to that place
the very process of democracy is such
its an obligatory process
by the time he reaches there
he or she reaches there
they are so super obligated to various
you know
people who supported them
when they come there
they are supposed to take care of all these people
thats what is called corruption by other people
theyre just paying back 
 is corruption a bad thing
 hmm
 is corruption a bad thing
 corruption essentially means
for me
that your selfinterest has risen above the larger interest
for which you
 thats what most politicians do
their selfinterest rises above the interest of the whole
 i think that would be a very unfair judgment
on all politicians
it is
its not a good thing to say
i know a whole lot of them are like that
but not all fortunately 
fortunately not all
 okay
ill accept that but
so corruption
some say its a system of rule
others say its an accelerator
others say its not a bad thing
its redistribution of wealth
what do you think it is 
 there are other ways to redistribute wealth
but what has happened is
let me talk about corruption in india because
i dont know what variety you have here
 i believe its the same out here 
 what has happened in india is
we inherited a whole bunch of laws from the british
and they were all so ambiguously made
probably by intent
when i look at many of those things
these are intentionally ambiguous
so that if i want to pick you up
i can anyway pick you up
for some reason or no reason
because the law is so ambiguous
whichever way you walk on the street
youre committing a crime 
okay
its designed in such a way
if i want to fix you
there is some law
because youre not doing anything thats a crime
youre doing something thats a crime
some where there is some law
for every citizen is committing some crime
 i told you its the same like uganda
its the same here 
 so the laws are so ambiguous 
particularly im ive been talking to the lawmakers
about the business laws
the laws are so ambiguous
without corrupt people business wont happen
if you stop all the corruption tomorrow morning in india
half the business will stop or more will stop
because these corrupt people are facilitating things unfortunately
because the laws are ambiguous
nobody understands
 so
 i meet the topmost corporate lawyer in india
and i was discussing something with him
and i asked him
do you really understand this law
he said sadhguru no
 you know that is like uganda
 he said dont tell anybody but i don
i have no clue 
all i know is
my client comes he tells me what he wants
i will argue for that powerfully in the court
thats all
 ill tell you how it works in uganda
you call them up at night
and you talk to them individually
and you address the individual needs
and one way of doing it could be to help them in a project
that theyre working on or
to pay off a loan to crane bank   or
or you know
that im sure thats the same thing that happens in india
isnt it
but the key question is
is it a bad thing
 thats what im saying
if you
if we want to remove corruption
now theyre talking about
bribegivers and bribetakers
both should go to prison
so
 wholl be left
 i i said ninety percent of the people will be in the prison 
because almost everybody has paid at some point
whos not paid
everybody has paid
so
this corruption as a  industry 
im calling it an industry
because its pretty well organized
and welloiled  
this corruption as an industry has thrived
because nations have not invested enough
in taking away the ambiguity in law
clearly everybody knows where they stand
now if im doing my business
and i know my law properly
you come and ask for money
im not going to pay you
now you come
i dont know what kind of laws you got
im doing my business im doing my best 
but you come and if i dont pay you
i dont know whether youre going to just fine me
or handcuff me and take me
i dont really know
 we could talk about politics or corruption all day
but im very keen to talk about health
we are like you said earlier
at a place where technology is extremely advanced
and were very concerned about trying to stick around a little longer
how do you maximize
how do you make sure that your lifestyle is healthy
it sounds like an innocuous question
which can be answered by a doctor
but from your point of view
 no lot of doctors are not healthy
 lots of doctors are not healthy 
 theyre not
 yeah
so in that context
with that in mind
health
good health
how do you achieve that
 see therere many ways to look at this
one fundamental way
the most fundamental way in which yoga looks at health is like this
this body as a composition of things is made up like this 
it is seventytwo percent water
twelve percent earth
six percent air
four percent fire
remaining is space
akash its called
now if you manage one element
that is water
seventytwo percent of your health and wellbeing is taken care of
there are two kinds of health issues
one is infectious
another is chronic
infectious means
its an invasion from an external organism
which for which you need a doctor
if you get an infection
you need chemical warfare
but seventy percent of the ailments on the planet are selfhelp
that is
they grow their own pet project within themselves
because theyve never paid attention to
how the body functions
what is the nature of my existence
no attention has been paid
theyre living by accident
so their being healthy or unhealthy also is by accident
when we say health
it is just that medically if you
if someone says you have no ailment
it does not mean youre healthy
when you wake up in the morning
are you feeling alive and bouncy or not
it is a certain sense of wholeness
the word health comes from the word whole
you must have a certain sense of wholeness
of body mind energy and the fundamental nature of your existence
if all these things are in alignment
now when you wake up in the morning
you feel like youre just born
if this happens to you
that means youre healthy
you may not be medically certified healthy
unhealthy
but still you may not be healthy
because aaaa 
thiss not health
health means there is a certain sense of wholeness
all ingredients have fallen together properly
and its alive
if this has to happen
one thing is
there is a most fundamental process in the yogic system called as bhuta shuddhi
that is you start taking charge of the elements within the system
if you control the elements in the system
if you master the elements in the system
health is not even an issue
i can show you thousands of people
who walked out of their chronic ailments without any treatment
we dont give them any treatment
just align your system in a certain way
this  settles
another way of looking at health is
question of alignment
every physical object in the universe
including your body
has a certain geometry to it
all physicality has a geometry to it
if the geometry arrives at a certain state of perfection
everything functions smoothly
if the geometry is little disaligned
everything becomes frictious
so what people are learning in the form of physical forms of yoga is not exercise
it is not  stretching
it is not about having abs 
it is about understanding
the geometry of your existence
today there is a theory in the scientific community
which is called as the constructional theory
what theyre trying to say is
the design
the fundamental design of the atom and the cosmos
is essentially same
weve been saying this for thousands of years 
anda pindanda you know
both are same
because the way the ameba is made
and the way you are made
essentially the design is same
complexity and sophistication has multiplied many times over
but fundamentally it is the same design
if its the same design
getting the geometry of your body right
in alignment with the larger geometry is important
if you get this geometry
then suddenly you find everything is happening smoothly within you
everything is in alignment
there is no friction
the functioning of any machine
the efficiency of any machine
is just a question of how frictionfree it is
if there is friction the machine is inefficient
if there is no friction it is functioning well
itll last longer
it is a joy to have that machine
otherwise its a misery to have that machine
 thats a very interesting point
and now coming to one of my final sessions
does anybody have any questions at all
if you do please put your hands up
because id like to identify you
there are a few questions
there are a few hands going up at this point
but right now i want to talk about love
i want to talk about marriage i want to talk about family
 you decide which one  love or marriage or family 
 well thats interesting
thats very interesting because
that was again the context in which i was looking at it
marriage and love not importantly
not necessarily tied together
 see love
love is something that happens within you
marriage is something that you do in the society with somebody
theyre two different things
im saying there may be love in your marriage
but there cannot be marriage in your love 
 thats actually true
 when we say love
we are always thinking love means with somebody
i love this person
i love that person
i love that person 
no
i want you to look at this carefully
love is something that happens within you
when your emotion comes to a certain sweetness
then you say im in love
that
with whom are you in love
you are just using the other person as a key
to open up a certain dimension within you
 i always thought that actually 
 but what im telling you right now is
why are you using a key
when there is no lock 
so the choice is just this
all the things which are most significant for you in your life 
you being peaceful
joyful
loving
blissful
these are important for you
 yes
 these things would you want them to be on pushstart or selfstart
you know in fifties
if you had
if you bought a car along with that you need two people 
morning pushstart 
early sixties crank start one person would do
now everything is on selfstart
so things that truly matter to you in your life 
your joy
your peacefulness
your love
your blissfulness
everything about you
that is beautiful about you
would you want to put it on selfstart or pushstart
selfstart
so if you are loving
this is not about anybody
if somebody is here you can express
nobody is here you can sit here lovingly 
 i want you to watch what im about to do right now sadhguru 
how many indian ugandans are in here today
indian ugandans
put up your hands please
 thats all
 indian ugandans okay
how many black ugandans are here
african ugandans
 hey i knew you   
 yeah yeah okay how many
can we just see the indian ugandans again
i think that they are more than those hands that
i saw up go up right
so how many of the indian ugandans
have been in a relationship with an african ugandan 
 hey this is not a confession 
 can i see a show of hands
there is one here
 no no the thing
the thing about indians is
they will never confess such things in public 
 okay
in that se in that case
then let me rephrase my question 
how many indian ugandans
here know an indian ugandan
that has been in some sort  of relationship with an african ugandan
okay
so therere more hands going up now
how many black ugandans or african ugandans have been in a relationship
with an indian ugandan
 theyre such a small percentage 001 percent
where do you find an indian and fall in love
 you see my point is sadhguru
and i need to report to you this you know
i need to report this to you
indians just dont let us near their daughters 
 that is not just for ugandans
they wont let even indians get close to their daughters 
 and in many ways
i think this is part of the problem
the fact that we live in a in a country that is multicultural in many ways
its cosmopolitan
but that element of social integration doesnt take place
 social integration need not mean
sexual integration
 whoa 
 now first of all
let me define that word relationship
why is relationship always of the body
so probably
for most indians and im true
im sure its true for many ugandans
 youre giving them an excuse sadhguru 
 you can tell me who youre aiming at
then i could 
 okay
 we lets redefine the word relationship
unfortunately everybody has picked on the word relationship
as it is said in the american bgrade movies
okay
a relationship is of many kinds
we hold various kinds of relationship with people
and maybe one relationship is of the body
rest may have nothing to do with the body
but we have many intimate and close relationships with people
where our bodies are not involved
 so we can be friends but i cant marry your daughter
 you can maybe marry if you pass the test 
but you want to just take her for two days
thats not allowed 
 but my my my bigger point is and
and i beg to belabor this because
i think its very important
i think i wonder  and please correct me if im wrong 
if for example
the indian community in uganda has done enough
to integrate into the greater part
into uganda and if
because dont you think surely
where i come from when you get married you
youre bringing one another family
you become a little more cohesive
you become friendlier
you become warmer you create a better understanding
isnt this something
the cultural hybridity
that results
isnt this something that the country would benefit from
 yes but the indian problem is
if they marry a ugandan girl
can she make dhokla  tomorrow
 she can learn 
 its not that simple 
its too complicated
no it is not about
i mean if youre looking at it as
are we in some state of discrimination
i dont think so
im telling you even in india
even if theyre in india
theyre whole lot of them are guajaratis
they wont marry tamil person within the country
they wont marry a bengali person
they wont marry an andhra person
somewhere if somebody falls in love
it may happen
but generally they would like to marry in their own community
in their own thing because
this is the way they have known life for thousands of years
about preserving
talent and culture within that
so why this was so is 
no
see were
were talking about times
when there were no universities to impart skills and knowledge
so right now
if there is a blacksmith
he wants to marry only a blacksmiths daughter
not a goldsmiths daughter
because she will be little dainty and fanciful
she wont last in the blacksmiths house
she wont last
so if this marriage has to be enduring
because theyre looking at children
till the children grow up
the husband and wife should be together
i mean theyre thinking of a lifetime
theyre not thinking of a few years
so they are very conscious about putting it through all kinds of screens
because they are thinking of marriage as a lifelong partnership
not as a brief encounter
 that doesnt make it a good thing
 im not saying its good or bad
im just saying
why they may not be opening up their doors of marriage
they dont open their door
gujaratis will not open their doors of marriage to tamil
tamil people no way will marry a gujarati 
yes they will not
maybe individual people
out of interaction
young people meet each other it may happen
but families will not do it
now things are changing a little bit
because its becoming difficult to find your own kind
so people are doing something
but itll still l take a long time
because of many aspects to this
its very difficult to explain because
see if i go
if i go in united states to somebodys house
i just smell the seasoning in the house
and i say youre this community isnt it
they say sadhguru how do you know
i said the seasoning 
because in a particular community
it smells in a particular way
another community which just lives in the neighborhood
they make seasoning in a different way
and these people cant stand that
and they cannot stand this
their tongues have been you know cultured
to like only this
am i saying is this good is this bad
this is not the way
it is great that there are so many varieties of people
and theyve distinctly maintained this for some time
today a time has come in the world
where people have to integrate
but it need not be made compulsory
let it happen at its own time 
 i just ive stopped chasing her now 
im going to ask you one of my last questions
and ill open up to the floor
and if you have questions
please put it up
put up your hands and well come to you
you know what my favorite quote of yours is
 i didnt know you were you
i was your favorite 
now im getting little
 yeah you said it this morning actually
 because you said you stopped chasing her
 yeah yeah yeah yeah
 and now youre saying im your favorite 
 by the way youre introducing a very interesting subject
i shall ask you
 no no no no no 
 i shall not go there
i shall not go there
but you said
this morning that bullshit can get you there
but it wont keep you there
 yeah
 in the context of destiny
in the context of trying to get to where were going
how do we make sure that were doing the right thing
and then when we get there
were going to stay there
and i must explain that statement was made in afollowing a story
and there was a story behind it
it wasnt just an independent statement
 see when we say destiny
when we say life
life is in the way you experience it
not in the content of life
it is in the context of life
the way it happens within you
you may you may be sitting under a tree and blissed out
you may be sitting in a palace and be depressed 
possible or no
 yes
 so the quality of life
and the destiny of your life
is the way it happens within you
so what the world throws at you
is not always your choice
it is a consequence of times in which we exist
but whatever it throws at you
what you make out of it is essentially you
this is your destiny
that it does not matter
what the world throws at you
you know how to make it a good thing for yourself
and everybody around you
this is taking charge of your destiny
destiny need not necessarily mean
all the physical situations that i dreamed of happened
but my experience of life happens the way i want it 
this
this means i am in charge of my destiny
well
here a whole lot of people have been sharing their stories with me
that in this country they prospered at one time
and they had to leave the country for eightten years
and then they came back
thats what i was telling them
if somebody was asked to leave
many people would hang from the trees
not being able to take it
but people went wherever they went
and they came back and recreated what they had
a whole lot of them
maybe many of them lost it
but what im saying is
what they created physically is not the thing
i must tell you a story
you okay for a for a mythological story
recently
i was talking to a
a large group of schoolchildren in a small town
in andhra pradesh
which was a strange thing for me
i was wondering whether they will understand english
but they were all highly perked up 
there were over 5000 children
and i was speaking to them
then one little girl stands up
a fourteenyearold girl
well im sorry i shouldnt call her a little girl
because she doesnt think
shes little
she stands up and asks
sadhguru you know ram in ayodhya
his wife gets kidnapped from sri lanka where is he 
 why are you pointing at
 he is sri lankan he kidnapped 
so this kings wife was kidnapped
and then he walked all the way to sri lanka
fought a battle set fire to that entire city
got his wife back went back home
its a big story
so this little girl asks
sadhguru is it practical for a man to walk from northern india to sri lanka
is this just a story
or is this real
then i look at her and say
see you are still a little girl
one day you will get a man of your own
when you get this man would
suppose you got lost somewhere
would you want a man wholl walk all the way
or who will think
this is not practical
and find solution in the neighborhood 
well she knows she wants a man
wholl walk all the way
that she knows
now if you
you know many of them are ram worshippers
they worship ram
if you look at rams life
its a continuous disaster 
yes
he is the king
because of some political reasons
he goes off into the jungle with his newly married wife
she is a princess
not trained to live in the jungle
seeing their plight
their brother
his brother leaves his wife and children and travels with him
to support him in the jungle
its a disaster
i know you might have seen some movie
where sita doing  that in the forest
no
you do one thing just by yourself you go and live in the forest
for three months
you will see whatll happen to you
its another game altogether
so then she is there
and this guy comes and kidnaps her and takes her to sri lanka 
and then he goes fights a battle
brings her back
again some political situation
she is pregnant and at that time she
he again takes her and leaves her in the jungle
all by herself
and no sonogram 
so he doesnt know whether
its a boy or a girl or boys or girls
she delivers twins
two boys
he doesnt know
children grow up in the jungle
then unknowingly he fights a battle with his own children
he could have easily killed his own children
it was very close
suppose unknowingly you killed your own children
do you need a bigger disaster in your life im asking
its the worst kind of disaster isnt it
it almost happened
fortunately he could not kill them
but then she died in the jungle
she
he never ever got to see her again
this is not a success story
but they worship him
not because he is a big success on the outside
no matter what happened
he did not lose his balance
he did not become resentful
he did not become hateful
he did not become angry
he did not lose his composure
no matter what life threw at him
he maintained who he is
so this is what we call as destiny
his destiny is totally in his hands
life can do whatever
but he will do only what he has to do
this is taking charge of your destiny 
 thank you very much and right now id like to open up for
 as a culture
they all learnt to bow down to that quality
not just success in the world
he is a big success as a human being within himself
for that were bowing down 
 im opening up the floor now for questions
im going to start with the gentleman over there
could you just put your hands up
if youd like to ask questions
quite a few hands going up
lets start with you sir
if can stand up and introduce yourself
 my name is old man with a clan
i am told that you are a guru of yoga
i would like to know from you
what animal is yoga
 what
 what animal
 ani
 animal
 what is yoga
 okay
 and how can it be useful
why should an old man like me care about it
and
 no i didnt get that part of the
what animal is
 what is yoga basically
 basically im asking what is yoga
 oh tch okay all right
 and why should i care about it
what is its value
i am seriously ignorant about it
the second question is
what is the purpose of life
how do i know that purpose
how do i pursue it
how to i find it and how do i live it
thank you 
 it seems to be a popular question eh 
 oh his name is andrew
not an old man though
 hmm
 his name is andrew
 his
 andrew
 andrew
 yes
 okay
andrew
when
when you ask what is yoga
im sorry
initially i missed that animal part 
i get it
what is this yoga
first let me tell you
this is the only practice on the planet
which has lived for over 15000 years
without any papacy
without any authority enforcing it on anybody
never in the history of this yogic culture
has it so happened
somebody put a sword to your throat and said
you do yoga otherwise youre dead
no such thing ever happened
out of sheer efficacy
because it works its lived
today over twobillion people are doing some form of yoga
what is it
many ways to look at it
i would like to explore two different ways
so that it brings some clarity to you
one thing is
you agree with me that
this human mechanism
which you call as myself right now
do you agree with me
that this is the most sophisticated technology on the planet
do you
 yes
 im just asking you
such a complex technology you have with you
have you read the users manual 
so one dimension of yoga
is to explore the users manual
which is written into this system 
so that you know
how to explore the full depth and dimension of
what this life is about
if you explore the full depth and dimension of what this life  is about
this second question
what is the purpose would be very easily answered
or in other words
to make simplify your question
what youre asking is
what is the nature of my existence
because you are certain that you exist
but you do not know the nature of your existence
if you think one way you become one way
if you think another way you become another way
if you feel one way you become one way
you feel another way tomorrow you fee
become another way
because what is human is not defined
if you had come as any other creature
we know what is a earthworm
we know what is a grass grasshopper
we know what is a tiger
we know what is a lion
but we dont know what is a human being isnt it
being human beings
you dont know what is a human being
because nature has left a certain freedom for you
with every other creature
nature has drawn two lines
within which they have to live and die
for the human being there is only a bottom line
there is no top line
this means
there is a limitless possibility of exploration
when we talk limitlessness
definitely we must leave the physical behind isnt it
because physicality is the dimension of the limited
physicality is always of boundaries
when we utter the word limitless
we must understand
we want to transcend physical nature
what is the purpose
suppose right now 
all of you im asking you 
if youre feeling really ecstatic
would you ask
what is the purpose of life
no
its becoming little burdensome
its a little drag
when you get up in the morning
what the hell am i doing here kind of feeling
now it comes up  what is the purpose
your idea of a purpose is you want a meaning
i want you to understand
meanings are a psychological problem
you want to find a meaning
there is no meaning anywhere in the existence
but meanings are important for your intellect
if you keep your intellect aside
there is no meaning to anything
the existence is simply on
what is the meaning of it
there is no meaning
this is just an intellectual pursuit
right now because of the nature of your education
the only dimension of intelligence
that youre exploring is intellect
intellect is like a scalpel
what are you give
whatever you give to your intellect
it will dissect
right now the very question that youre asking
is to dissect
what is the meaning of life
what is the purpose of life means
we must dissect this life and see
why this life
why am i here
what should i do
where should i go
this is simply because
right now life is not being experienced
most human beings have become
a bundle of thoughts emotions ideas opinions and prejudices
these are all your making this is not life
this is your making
your psychological drama has overtaken the existential drama
the creation
such a magnificent creation
but right now your psychological drama has overtaken
the creation itself
today sun came up on time
hello
 yes
 so what tch no 
i must tell you this
some time ago a year or little more than that
i was to
i was flying a helicopter in united states
and it was a good day weatherwise
so we took off the doors and were flying a
open helicopter
well every aviator knows
for every 1000 feet that you go up how much temperature and stuff
but we just went up there suddenly a cloud cover
we hit a cold front
the temperature dropped dramatically
where you know
even to hold the controls it became difficult
so we decided to come down
as we were coming down
we were just discussing
suppose tomorrow sun doesnt come up what happens
oh we thought maybe in three months
this will happen
six months that will happen
we came down and did a bit of research and we found
if sun does not come up tomorrow morning
in eighteen hours time
almost everything that you know as life will be gone
except certain microbes deep in the earth
almost everything will be frozen and gone
so sun came up today morning
i want to hear appropriate noises
eh 
yeah its not a small thing
but
sun came up on time
planet is spinning on time
the entire galaxy is going on without any accidents
everything in this cosmos today is going great
but you have one little nasty little thought
crawling in your head and its a bad day 
so
when your intellect overtakes your experiential dimension
then you will start thinking
what is the purpose of life
because life is a purpose onto itself
if you experience this life in its fullness
right now
your psychological drama is hijacking your life
most of the time youre thinking about life
not living life
i want you to go back to the greatest experience in your life
whatever was the most exhilarating experience in your life
suppose right now you were in that moment
would you ask me what is the purpose of life
the moment you ask this question
immediately people will come up with this
godgiven purposes that everybody has
the moment some
whenever
i have seen
whenever someone says god told me this
you can be very sure the
a disaster is unfolding 
yes
whenever people spoke these words
disasters were unfolding around them
so i want you to just look at this
first of all
this
this convoluted idea has been taught to human beings
that existence is humancentric
no
this solar system is a speck in this cosmos
tomorrow morning
if this speck vanishes
nobody will miss it believe me
in this tiny speck of a solar system
planet earth is a micro speck
in that micro speck
kampala is a super micro speck
in that you are a big man 
now this is
this is not a simple problem
 right and thank you very much for that
any more questions
any more questions
let me take the question from the lady here
can i just get a
 we need to tell him the aba
about the animal the zoo of yoga
 yes the zoo of yoga
 yeah
another dimension of yoga is this
as you sit here this is me thats you
distinctly clear isnt it
hmm
no confusion between you and the person sitting next to you
one hundred percent its clear
this is me this is somebody else
but youre inhaling and exhaling
what you exhale somebody may be inhaling
what they exhale youre inhaling
at least what you exhale the trees are inhaling
what the trees exhale youre inhaling
if you stop this transaction
because you thought youre too much of a solid state
this is the end of you
this is not just in respiration
this is happening even in your subatomi
subatomic particle level
that there is a transaction going on with the entire existence
i want you to just look at the reality we are in
we are sitting on a planet
round in shape
that too on the equator
were sitting like this  
you know
suppose you got your school
your high school globe to your house
and sit on it
you will be sitting like this 
its an odd way to sit you know on the equator
at least you must migrate to north pole
where you could sit firmly
youre sitting like this
and the damn planet is spinning
and in the middle of nowhere you dont know where it begins
where it ends
here were sitting here and thinking what is the purpose of life 
now who you are right now
its like this
let me give you an analogy
as schoolchildren
when you were children
you might have blown soap bubbles
did you andrew andrew andrew
soap bubble
did you blow soap bubbles
 andrew
 thats okay thats okay
so when you blew a bubble
this was your bubble this was somebodys bubble
distinctly there
but when it burst what was the major content of this bubble
the air within where is my air and where is your air
there is no such thing
even now there is no such thing
you are just imagining that this is me
that is you
till you bury
till youre buried
it looks like you wont understand
if you understand right now your life will transform
if you get it at that time tch
its a bit too late 
 okay
 yoga means to obliterate the boundaries of your individuality
as you sit here
if you can obliterate the boundaries of your individuality
and begin to experience everything as myself
or myself as everything
suppose you sat here in this hall
and experienced all the people in this hall
as you experience the ten fingers on your hand
because i want you to understand
whatever the content of your body was not you some time ago
its just the food that youve eaten
it is the soil which has become food
it is the food which has become flesh
it was not you yesterday
today it is you
so what is not you youre able to make it yourself
simply because you include it into the boundaries of your sensations
so yoga means to be able to expand these boundaries in such a way
that if you sit here
you experience the entire universe as yourself
if you sit here and experience the entire universe as myself
then we say you are in yoga
not doing yoga
then you are a yogi
so this is the purpose of yoga
because not that this is something that weve invented
this is the way life is happening
life is not happening as individual
this is one big cosmic life
you can blow your own soap bubble
and have a sense of individuality
the magnanimity of creation is such
though you are a puny little nothing
it gives you a great sense of individuality
for a period of time
so enjoy that
but dont get lost in it
because that is not your nature
right now youve blown a bubble
enjoy the bubble
but you must know
this air is constantly in movement
if it is not in movement
itll suffocate
so yoga means to consciously obliterate this
as i was telling you
whether its sexuality
or love
or ambition
or conquest
or yoga
essentially the goal is same
in some way you want to make this  bigger than what it is
but if it becomes bigger it wants to become bigger
so yoga means you learn to obliterate the individual boundaries
so that you can experience the entire universe as myself
this is not a philosophy
this is not an ideology
this is the way existence is happening
if you experience life the way it is
then you can handle life most efficiently
if you do not experience it the way it is
but you have your own psychological drama
which tells you something else
then with the simplest things people are confused
people dont know how to handle their thought and emotion even today
after fiftysixty years of life
simply because they have not seen life the way it is
they are imagining things
which are not there in their psychological space
so yoga means to know reality
to perceive reality just the way it is
if you perceive everything just the way it is
your ability to conduct life is greatly greatly enhanced
to a point where other people think it is superhuman
so essentially
it is about realizing the immensity of
what it means to be human 
 we still have a few minutes left
there are very many hands going up at the moment
about yeah so lets keep going
can i see the hands that are up again please
lots of hands
mukesh youd like to ask a question
 pranam guruji this question which im going to ask is not ive
ive heard the answer before
but i would like this question to be answered by sadhguru
for the benefit of lot of ugandan friends and colleagues
and associates whom weve invited here
because during the time of passing invitations
many of them point blank declined 
so this is yoga is to do with hinduism
so sadhguru
if you can please explain
is yoga specific to a belief system
or a particular religion
thank you 
 a friend of mine actually told me
when i invited him over that
im a follower of christ so i cant come
so thats an important question that mukesh is asking
 so for the followers of christ
let me say something 
he said many things
or today people say he said many things
but some things we were sure he said it
rest of it we dont know
on the way there are entrepreneurs you know
but the important thing about his life is
he talked about taking people to another dimension of life
which he referred to as kingdom of god
everybody thought its up there
 isnt it
 people gathered 
let me say 
people gathered
when enough people gathered
he turned around and said
the kingdom of god is within you
whoever says that he is a yogi 
 jesus christ was a yogi
 i am not saying anything
i am saying whoever says the ultimate nature of the existence is within you
hes a yogi
thats what yoga means
so what he said
what he did not say
ive not made a study of it
i do not know
but people have been telling me this is what he said
if he said this he must be a yogi
because unless youre in that experience of inclusiveness
you wouldnt say that
he definitely did not read a yoga text
he must have experienced hmm
 i was going to say that yeah maybe he didnt read it
 he didnt he def
he did not read that
it is from an inner experience that hes saying its within you
if he says its within you
this means he is a yogi
so what kind of a yogi he is
well hes middle eastern
so hes of a certain kind
he speaks the language of the time and the area
whoever came anytime
in india thousands of yogis came
the reason why thousands came is
this land developed a certain discipline
that if somebody talks about dimensions beyond our experience
we should never persecute them
this discipline they brought into their culture
because of this
every generation produced
thousands of enlightened beings
everybody is saying their own thing in their own way
but ultimately talking about the same reality
but in this part of the world
or wherever he came
he stood out
because generally persecution was the way
apart from organized religion
if everything was
anything else was said he would be dead
thats the normal thing
well it happened to him also
anyway
it happened to him also
a horrible way of ending his life
even today i see
when i go to certain countries
i am not abusing anybody
im just asking a few questions
if i ask a few questions
in some countries they stand up and tell me 
you will leave this country headfirst  
that means horizontal
thats what they mean 
i tell them
everywhere i go i always go head first
you also should learn this head first 
now about this yoga being hindu
its like this
this is a profound understanding of human mechanism
if you say yoga is hindu
gravity must be jewish 
the word hindu means this
there is a himalayan range in the northern part of india
in the south there is an indian ocean
this is called himalaya
this was called indu sagara
hindu means the land that lies between the himalayan ranges and this indian ocean was called hindu
this culture prospered and flourished for over 56000 years
undisturbed by invasions
undisturbed by other wild tribes which are outside
so people slowly developed reverence to these two geographical features
because they knew their wellbeing was mainly
because of these himalayan ranges and the ocean
which protected them
so they called the land hindu to start with
later on they called themselves hindu
so anything thats born in this land
because its a geographical identity
an earthworm born in that land is a hindu earthworm 
this is not a religious identity
this is a geographical identity
like right now a lion born in africa is called and african lion
so why is an earthworm born in india not a hindu earthworm 
but somewhere along the way
when external forces came
they had a religion of their own
they had a god of their own
they had a book of their own
we didnt have any
because we were not believers at any time in history
even today
india is not a land of believers
it is a land of seekers
the highest value is not god in india even today
if you do not know 
the highest value is mukti
which means liberation or freedom
freedom is the highest value
god has never been the highest value
we know the technologies of godmaking 
we made thirtythreemillion gods and goddesses 
because we understood how to create a form and energize it
and make it work in a particular way for us
but never ever that culture propagated a god up there
a book which tells you what to do
everything is a debate
even when people who were recognized godly
when they came
there were no commandments
there were only debates
endless debates
even today
indians are still debating 
 in the same vein therefore
 hmm
 is there such a thing as an afterlife or is this it
 you want to know what happens after death
 yeah
 some things you know best by experience 
 so you want me to die faster then find out what happens 
 no no no 
the thing is everybody wants to know what happens after death
but actually what theyre asking is
what is the nature of my existence
im here right now
but i know one day
people who were here before me
they died and pup they vanished
what happened
so whatll happen to me
what youre saying is
what is the nature of my existence
will my existence end with this body
or will something else happen
will i go to some place
will the accommodations be good there 
how is the climate  
all these things
see if you want to know the nature of your existence
this is the best time to know isnt it
youre here alive
with an active intelligence
this is the best time to explore
another dimension of yoga is this 
not by not by dogma
not by theory
not by belief
but by systems of exploration
is this
is this true that your body that you have right now
you gathered it over a period of time
hello
 yes
 whatever you gather
you can claim it is mine
but if you say its me
you kind of lost it isnt it
hello
you understand what im saying
 yes
 see right now i say
this glass is my glass
then you will think
oh sadhguru has some problem
but lets listen some more
everybody says hes wise
after some time
i take this and i say
this is me
then you will say lets go 
because this amounts to madness
but right now there is water here
if i drink it it does become a part of me isnt it
 yes
 this is how you gathered whatever number of kilograms you have right now with you 
yes or no
this entire body was gathered from outside
the content of the mind and the content of the body
you gathered from outside
this is a heap of food
this is a heap of impressions
what you gather can be yours
can never ever be you
so there must be something beyond this body
beyond this mind
dont assume
why dont you explore
how can you live here without knowing the nature of your existence
you want to know what happens after death
dont you want to know right now
what is the nature of your existence
you must know
if you dont know
you will be eternally confused human being
 thank you any more questions please
yes
lets have the lady here ask a question
anybody at the back
okay and then ill come
lets move to the back of the room next please
 pranam sadhguruji
ive just got a question here
 okay can we have the lady here first
please
yes
 pranam guruji
good evening
 thank you so much
namaste sadhguru
 right i think there are very many microphones going around at the moment
 okay the lady here
and then well come to you
 okay
 yes please ask your question
 okay pranam guruji good evening alan my first question is to alan
 whats your name
 im renu and im new to uganda
my question to you alan is
would you very briefly tell me what is ubuntu
 right i wish i could tell you briefly but   to tell me briefly about it
ubuntu of course is the fact that
we are all human beings
and were all gathered to we are all one basically
 oh youre talking about yoga 
what do you call that undu hmm
 ubuntu ubuntu
 thats yoga
 yes 
 but
but the difference may be
in yoga we have systems and methods
through which we can experience
we can bring you to an experience of undu 
the methodology 
but right now you may have a philosophy of oneness
but you dont have a method
the thing is to teach a scientific process through which
you can come to that state of what you call as
 ubuntu
 guruji how ubuntu has been explained to me is 
essentially i am who i am because of who we all are
so i am a reflection of alan and alan is a reflection of me
i dont know if that is true or not
 no no no
 i would love to look that way
 no no no i wouldnt take that seriously
 i agree 
 so guruji
can we take it to vasudev kutumbakam somehow
 no no no no no 
 between ubuntu and vasudev kutumbakam
do you think there is any commonality
 see do do not try to reduce everything into a slogan
this is a dangerous process
 yes but the interconnectedness of humans
 thank you very much
before you answer that question
can i have the lady that stood up and then the gentleman please
id like to have as many female voices in  
and then and then yeah
whats your name and whats your question
 okay so namaste sadhguru
my name is rochelle bhatinda and im a storyteller
you talked about the bodys ability to heal itself
and i had this question in mind
its about the kundalini
now can you ignite the kundalini to heal the healthy body of diseases
and would you encourage somebody with really complicated illnesses
like heart disease
to ignite their kundalini to heal themselves
thank you
 are you ugandan 
 yes im ugandan
im of ngo clan
 shes a muganda
shes from my tribe 
but what she just talked about
i have no idea about 
what did she just say by the way 
 this is
the thing is
the indian languages have an elaborate vocabulary
to describe different dimensions that function within you
the english language has phenomenal vocabulary
to describe the outside
but when it comes to the inside
its very poor
but the indian languages
particularly sanskrit
shes picked up one word from that
it has an
 so it actually exists
 hmm
 the word exists
 yes yes 
so kundalini means a certain
right now im speaking
this is kundalini
the energy behind this is kundalini
you are listening that is also kundalini
a dog is barking that is also kundalini
a flower is blossoming that is also kundalini
or in other words
that energy which makes everything happen in the physical creation
is called kundalini
so what theyre right now referring to is
there is an entire system called kundalini yoga
to maximize this energy
because generally
in most human beings
to eat sleep reproduce and die
a miniscule of this energy is active means
its good enough
if you raise this energy
then what is happening is
in the composition of elements
youre chi
youre trying to change the fundamental composition of how youre made
that is youre trying to increase
what is called as akash
this means your perception will enhance
because only what you perceive you know
rest is just imagination
right now
our modern education systems have surrendered to information
after some time you will see
information means nothing
because you seem to know everything
but you dont know anything
right now we know so much about health
but they tell me
the worlds food industry is 76 trillion dollars
the worlds pharmaceutical industry is seven point two trillion dollars
theyre saying by the end of ninety
i mean 2017
the pharmaceutical industry will overtake the food industry
that means well be eating more medicine than food on this planet
and were healthy 
we
we know so much about health
but we don't know how to be healthy
like this
because information only gives you a sense of knowing something
but you cannot really make it happen in life that way
it is
it is okay with material things
but when it comes to life
information doesnt take you anywhere
probably your grandma your grandmother lived with much more life sense
than with all the intellect and education that most people have today
simply because there was life sense
everything was by experience
so kundalini when we talk about it
we are trying to raise the energy
now can it heal ailments and this
we must understand this much
this entire body was created from within right
whatever you
i hear you eat a lot of bananas
but by eating all those bananas
you didnt go bananas you became human all right 
so whatever you eat
there is something inside
which is capable of manufacturing this body
when the very source of manufacturing this body is within you
if there is a repair job to be done
is it best to go to the manufacturer
or to the local tinker 
if you have access with the manufacturer
you would go to the manufacturer
if youve lost access you will go to the local
tinker
the i saw theyre building a huge toyota showroom
and a repair shop
so if you have access
you will go to the toyota showroom when you have a toyota
otherwise youll do
go to the local guy who fixes everything with a hammer 
 and you know thats just one type of yoga isnt it
how many types of yoga exist
and how do i know which one is right
 on a certain day
four people were walking in the forest
one of them was a karma yogi
another was a gnana yogi
another was a bhakti yogi
another was a kriya yogi
what this means is
if you employ your body or physical action to reach your ultimate nature
we call this karma yoga
yoga of action
if you employ your intelligence to do the same
we call this gnana yoga
yoga of intelligence
if you employ your emotion to do this
we call this bhakti yoga
yoga of devotion or emotion
if you employ your energies to do that
we call this kriya yoga
yoga of transforming energies
so these four men were walking together
usually these four people will be
never found together
because they cannot get along
because a man
the yoga of intelligence has a very sharp intellect
those who have a sharp intellect cant stand devotional people
have you seen this
yes or no 
 yes
 they cant stand devotional people whore doing ram ram all the time
they cannot stand them
 andrew    is one of them
he cant stand emotional people
 yes he is for gnana yoga candidate 
so these are the only four types of yoga you can do
because these are the only four instruments you have on your hands
so these four people were walking
suddenly a thunderstorm broke loose
and they started running looking for shelter
the bhakti yogi
the man of devotion said
in this direction theres and ancient temple
lets go there
well they trust him with the geography of temples
so they ran there
this is an ancient temple where the walls have all collapsed
just four columns and a roof
and theres a deity in the center
they all rushed into the temple 
not because of their love for god
simply escaping the storm
then the storm became very severe
started lashing from every direction
there was no other place
so they came closer and closer
then they just hugged the deity and sat down
all four of them
just to escape the rain
not because they love god
and suddenly god appeared tch
in all their minds the same question
why now
we did so many things you did not come
now when were just escaping the rain you turn up
why now
so god said
at last you four idiots got together
ive been waiting for this for a long time 
so yoga 
you are not just body
just mind
just energy
just emotion
you are a combination of these things
unless they come together in the right way
there is no yoga for you
so you are one kind of combination
somebody else is another kind of combination
accordingly it has to be mixed
that is why a live guru is important
because he mix the right concoction for you 
 thank you very much
lets go to the back of the room please
yeah
whoever gets the microphone first
 maa
you must take the microphone
please
 to the back of the room
please
the very back of the room
yes
yes
 hi hello hi i had a quick question about faith traditions
im actually a former graduate student in religious studies
and one of the biggest challenges
i have is this dichotomy that exists in religious faith
especially fervent religious faith in religions that are
or rather in people who chose to believe in their religion in a certain way
and what i mean by that is there is great beauty when you go to particular countries
and you go to a mosque
and theres incredible adherence to faith
that can be inspiring
and you can see that in all traditions
across all countries
but often
that faith is coupled with negative attitudes
homophobia
islamophobia
fear of the other
and my question to you is
how do we see the beauty in religious faith
while also avoiding some of the problematic things
that happens within dogmatic belief
 its a really tough one
 no its very simple
 is it
 yeah
 okay
 see  the thing is just this
right now im going to
this is just an experiment
is it okay
can i experiment with you
 yes
 this is just a simple experiment
how many of you believe in god
all such people raise your hand
okay
thats good
how many of you believe you have two hands
all such people raise one hand 
how many of you believe you have two hands
okay
do you believe you have two hands
or do you know you have two hands 
hmm
you know you have two hands isnt it
if somebody starts an argument with you
and tries to prove to you
you have no two hands
and suppose their argument
becomes too overwhelming
and hes about to prove to you that you have no hands 
one slap in the face 
he will know that you got hands 
so with hands you know
with god you believe
im im not trying to take it somewhere else
i just want you to understand
belief essentially comes
still because humanity has not become sincere enough to come to this 
what i know i know
what i do not know i do not know
yes 
everything
everything that you do not know
you must believe
because belief gives you confidence
this is the biggest disaster on the planet 
confidence without clarity
what you need is clarity about life
not confidence
if you cannot see
right now i want to walk through you all right
but my vision is not clear
but im a very confident man
im going to walk through you
but i cant see properly 
am i a disaster or no
if i cant see properly
i must at least go gently
i cannot see properly please help me through this
if you do not have clarity
at least you must have hesitation
about what youre doing
you have no clarity
but you have confidence is a disaster
humanity has suffered immensely for this
maximum amount of bloodshed
maximum amount of hatred
things have happened like this
i want you to know this 
people may be projecting it this way
that the fight in the world is between good and bad
like you also tried to describe
theres a good part theres a bad part
there is
the fight is not between good and evil
the fight is always between one mans belief and another mans belief 
why is it
why is it we cannot come to a place
that we can admit
what i do not know as i do not know
what is the problem
you will have a much more sincere straighter world
once you realize i do not know
the longing to know
the seeking to know cannot be put down
it is the nature of human intelligence 
if you do not know something
you will want to know it
now were talking about
see youre not talking about god
you are not talking about heaven
you are always talking about the nature of your existence isnt it
who the hell are you
how did you happen
this is the question
because you have no answers
youre inventing all kinds of things and believing it
it may give you confidence
it may bring you together with people
you may sing
you may dance
but you will also fight
because it is invariably bound to happen
for the last 23000 years you have seen how many wars have happened
because you believe one thing
somebody believes something else
i think its time humanity matures into this level of sincerity 
what i know i know
what i do not know i do not know
i want you to realize the immensity of i do not know
if you see i do not know
the longing to know
the seeking to know
and the possibility of knowing becomes a reality
otherwise you just believe something
can i tell you a small
can i tell them a small joke alan
 yeah
 because this is serious stuff you know
 yeah certainly a small joke
 small joke
there were two young boys
very energetic
when young boys are very energetic
they are in constant trouble and they are
the parents are very embarrassed
because the entire community is discussing their children
but you know
you know how to produce them
but you dont know how to fix them isnt it 
so not knowing what to do
they decided to take them to the local parish priest
because together theyre very strong
they decided to take them separately
so they took the younger boy first
made him sit down in the priests office
and the parents left
the priest walked in with his long robes
and he walked up and down
you know
it needs some drama
otherwise these things dont work 
so he walked up and down with a grave face
the boy sat there and did the pingpong act
looking at the priest
and this priest worked up a strategy
if i remind this boy that god is within him
all his mischief will go
this is always the problem 
people who have never raised children
they have fantastic ideas 
those who have raised children
they know none of your goddamn ideas will work
if you have the commitment
if you have the love and commitment
you can wait out the problems
but you dont know how to fix the problems of your children isnt it 
so anyway he came up with this strategy
and suddenly in midstride he stopped
and with a booming voice he asked
where is god
the boy looked bewildered
he looked all over
because he must be somewhere in the priests office 
then the priest saw hes not getting the point
then he leaned on the table
pointing at the little boy 
hes giving him a clue
god is within you 
where is god
the boy looked even more bewildered and looked under the table 
then the priest saw hes not getting it
so he walked around
came close to the boy
tapping on the little boys chest 
hes giving a clear clue where god is 
tapping on his chest he asked
where is god
the boy got up and bolted out of the room
he ran to the place where his elder brother was
and he said
were in real trouble
the elder brother asked
why what happened
he said
they have lost their god
and they think we did it 
 i would like to take a few more questions
but were pressed for time
so im going to try to wind up this conversation
therere so many hands still going on going up
im not sure what to do about that but
very many hands going up
how much more time do i have
five minutes
okay
we shall find a way of addressing all those questions at some point
but sadhguru lets just wind down our conversation
ive always wanted to ask you
whats with the beard
where did that come from
 im sorry
 whats with the beard
 youre trying i can see 
i thought everybody knew about this
this is something that grows on every man 
those whove removed it
you must ask them
why did you remove it 
whyre you asking me
i did nothing about it 
 so you just didnt shave then 
 i just didnt do anything about it
because i thought everythings thats given to me
particularly around my head
has a specific purpose 
 so i should grow my beard as well
 you can try
youre trying i can see 
 okay that answers that
so when youre not trying youre quite
 no i can say something further on that
 yes
 see if you ask people why they have cut this
left this cut this left that
whatever
all the distortions they have done 
why if you ask them they say
this is my fashion
all right
so it is not about fashion
it is essentially wherever there is no pain in your body
this is what you do
suppose there was no pain in your nose
im sure in the name of fashion
you would have stripped it in many different ways 
suppose there was no pain in your entire body
im sure in the name of fashion
you would pull out your intestines and swing it 
if there was no pain
you think people wouldnt do it
they would do all kinds of things
or in other words
right now for most human beings
it is not their sense which is preserving them
it is their pain which is preserving them
which is not a good way to live
 thats interesting 
and when youre not offering this amazing
this amazing wisdom and insight
youre riding motorbikes and riding fast cars
whats the fastest youve ever driven by the way
 342
 342 kilometers an hour
what were you trying to do
kill yourself 
 no
i
i am not a foolish driver
im a good driver 
 and i know that
that you love indian classical music
what other music do you listen to
do you listen to lady gaga
hiphop or these other things 
 there was a time when
rock and roll was everything
my parents were steeped in classical music
but we hated it  the children
me and my brother
we would turn up rock and roll at full volume
just so that this classical music by accident doesnt enter my ear
and pollute me
okay
thiss how i was
but it happened to me
i became meditative over a period of time
one day i was on motorcycle 
it it was in the mysore university
this was such a distinct and powerful experience for me 
and i was just riding
i heard a powerful sound you know
some musical instrument that i cant recognize
it just
it just gripped me like that and just drew me
its not like i decided to go there
i just went
theres an open air theater
i just rode up to that place
and i parked there and i just looked
and somebody was playing
today i know it is a rudra veena
its played in a very mild slow way
its not like dhang dhang dhang
 not like rock and roll
 its like dhyaan dhyaan its going
this sound just gripped me from within
i just sat there on my motorcycle
tears were coming out of my eyes
just the sound was just destabilizing everything inside me
it just shook me through and through
from that day 
suddenly my ear for classical music just evolved
into a big possibility
and today we are one of the major music festivals in india happens
in the yoga center
the rock and roll was important
because it moves your body and boom boom boom
but once you become still within you
suddenly this classical music
when i say classical
the indian classical music is made in such a way
if you listen to it carefully
you will see your body will become still and erect
you will see people unknowingly will sit like this
i must tell you this
this is about ten years ago
when i f when we first started this school home school
i went there
all these six sixandahalfyearold children
in the morning assembly i went there to see them
they are all like this 
like this 
like this 
like this 
i said why are these kids like broken tops
and i thought what to do with them
i just taught them the seven notes 
sa re ga ma pa dha ni sa
these are the seven notes
twelve minutes a day
ill tell you after a monthandahalf i go there
theyre all sitting like this  unmoving
thats the impact it has on the system
a proper arrangement of sounds
because sound is a reverberation
today modern science is proving to you
everything in the existence is just a reverberation of energy
your idea of physicality is a myth
if you get the sounds right
you can make it coincide with who you are
you can make it relate to the larger reality
this is called as nadha yoga
that means coming to a state of union within yourself just by using sounds
so the music has this
when youre young
you like something that moves your body
so it was rock and roll
now youre saying its hiphop 
 and finally when its all said and done
how do you want to be remembered
 i want everybody to be so blissed out
that they wouldnt care to remember me 
miserable people always remember
joyful people may have things in memory
but its not such a big thing
so if people are always saying
sadhguru sadhguru
this means theyre not still complete
i want every one of them to be so complete
that i am unemployed
and they dont have to remember me
its a good thing 
 ladies and gentlemen the sadhguru
a round of applause 
thank you
thank you very much 
and i was going to say thank you so much
for being such an amazing audience
and apologies to the people whose questions i couldnt take today
and the sadhguru will be conducting
well give you a little more information in a few moments
about how more you can interact with the sadhguru
again my name is alan kasujja
and thank you very much 
 thank you
