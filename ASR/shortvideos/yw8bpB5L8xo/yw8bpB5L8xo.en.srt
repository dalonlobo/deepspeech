1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:07,599
Was just

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,929
Talking to somebody who's some kind of an expert on the internet and stuff. I said what's happening because I?

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,090
Don't get to see anything except a bit of nails and our own work

5
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,789
all the time I

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,790
Never get to browse or see anything so I was asking what are people looking for what is it?

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,280
And he's saying it like it's a matter of fact. He's saying that it was 70% his only pornography

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,410
70% of

9
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:47,549
The Internet traffic is pornography. I don't know if this percentage is correct, but if it's anywhere near that I

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,120
Mean what's happened to us

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,720
When such a powerful medium that we can communicate with the entire world don't we have anything better to say

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,290
I'm not trying to be moralistic and said this is wrong

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,980
That is wrong, but I am saying for the first time

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,120
In the history of humanity we have this capability

15
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,739
That we can

16
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,880
Say something to the entire world in one shot

17
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,930
Never before this was even imaginable. Isn't it I?

18
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,340
Want you to understand you just taken it for granted your whatever?

19
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:37,020
Instagrams and what's apps and Twitter's and emails don't take it for granted. This is the first time?

20
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,570
That we can communicate

21
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,570
to every human being on the planet

22
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,670
Is it not important the highest possibilities get to them?

23
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,210
Today

24
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,770
the three

25
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:03,120
biggest industries on the planet are the first number-one industries arms and armaments

26
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,939
Number two is alcohol and tobacco put together

27
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,870
Number three is for Monsieur tickles

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,090
This says everything about us. What kind of people we are isn't it and

29
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,420
On the Internet is pornography

30
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:33,119
We as a generation should not let this opportunity pass we should not let these

31
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,049
Sex maniacs

32
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,320
Child sellers to dominate this world

33
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,790
How can we allow people who sell children to do dirty things with them to dominate this planet?

34
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,890
Tell me we are allowing them to do it

35
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,720
We don't have to fight them everybody thinks we have to fight no we have to overwhelm them with positive things

36
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
You
